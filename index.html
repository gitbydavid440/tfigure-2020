Which Roux will //YOU// be?

[[*********************Patron Quickjump Menu*****************|Quickjump Menu]]

Transfigure: is an adult interactive fiction (text based) game currently written in Twine/Sugarcube (plays in modern browsers) focusing on the male to female transformation of its main character, Taylor Roux. The story caters to a variety of subjects and tastes. The entire game is fairly large and has many planned and partially written endings, with routes ranging from romantic and frisky, to downright hedonistic debauchery and submission. Transfigure has about one hundred envisioned endings but finishing the current core story is priority. Some content and themes include FF, MF, involuntary M2F transformation, voluntary decisions, blackmail, corruption, best friends, maid and nurse fetish, impersonation, impregnation, a variety of standard erotic fair (hj, bj, sex etc) Plus a whole bunch more planned down the line as I complete the early portions of the story and add them to the game.

The main plot focuses on Taylor&#39;s quest to find out what the heck happened to him while finding a way to return to his original body. How seriously he takes the mission is up to you. There is a lot going on in the background and so it will take multiple play throughs to unravel the main story and meet all of the characters. Each of the in game romances are unique and have wildly different themes and relationship dynamics and motivators and they each will have several different ends. The various story lines involve everything from strange experiments and mad science gone awry to interplay between the various distinct characters all the way to elaborate global conspiracies and powerful competing national and corporate interests along with other topics that never make their way into a normal porn game. (This is not a normal porn game.) There is heart touching romance all the way to rape. There are spy missions and will be assassinations and explosions. Some people will die and unusual circumstances will be experienced... all while Taylor is trapped in an unfamiliar body that seems to inexplicably fan arousal in those around him. This is a story about choices and their consequences, transformation, and transfiguration. Will Taylor make it out alive and with his mind intact?

Some upfront warnings: This is an adult game. There is humiliation and drug use in some routes as well as numerous sensitive topics. Taylor Roux also has a notorious potty mouth, so if that bothers you, steer clear.

Note: All characters, places, and events in this story are completely fictional.  All characters participating in sexual acts are over 18.

Please enjoy the tale of Mr. Roux!

&lt;p&gt;During a typical autumn morning before class, you stifle a yawn as you scroll through several web pages.  Pornographic images flit by on your screen but you keep scrolling, searching for something exceptionally titillating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually you find what you are looking for: a particularly erotic video of a young blonde woman masturbating.  She is stunningly beautiful and the way she strokes herself and moans in pleasure turns you on immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/transfigureblonde.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You begin to masturbate, seeking your own pleasure, stroking yourself faster and faster until you are near your breaking point.  Just as you are about to cum, a popup appears and covers the whole screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!” you curse as you frantically sit up and close the window.  You have multiple ad blocking programs and a script blocker but you notice that somehow as of late the ads seem to keep evolving and more and more of the blasted things seem to plague your eyes every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a glance at your computer’s clock, you silently curse again.  You have class soon and know you have to hurry, otherwise your fap window will be closed until the evening, or god forbid, put off until tomorrow.  A new semester of university has just started and you don’t want to slack off for at least another couple weeks.  This made personal, alone time quite precious.  A young man in your position must sleep, eat, and take his momentary pleasures whenever there was an opportunity, lest they [[pass by completely.]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;&lt;set $start to true&gt;&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Look around your room" tags="" position="4399,494" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You stand and shake out your short, slender limbs as you pace about your room.  Your room isn’t huge but it it is comfortable.  Game and anime posters cover the walls and in the corner sits your PC and gaming lair.  You currently live with your sister Julie in a small house owned by your parents.  It isn’t anything fancy but you are glad for the cheap rent and great location, located near the university you both attend while also close to amenities like a grocery store and large strip of prominent bars and nightclubs.  This makes stumbling home late at night very easy and probably encouraged a few more late nights than you were used to during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your PC’s black screen silently taunting you, you glance at a nearby clock and curse again.  “Shit!”  //Class in 15...I will have to run!// You think as you quickly lock up and dash out of the house, still lamenting your ruined fap session and aching, blue balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You head towards campus, jogging down the sidewalk towards the towering buildings in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way to class you notice a distinctive flash of bright red hair.  You look over and watch with rapture as &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Samantha&quot; &quot;Sam desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, a gorgeous, freckled bombshell and object of your affections for years, jogs through a nearby park.  //She is sooo hot!// You feel a tightness in your pants and a longing in your heart as you stare at her.  Samantha is your ideal woman in every conceivable way.  She&#39;s smart //and// pretty.  Too bad all you can do is look, for every time you try to speak with her in person turns into a comedic disaster.  You lose yourself in Sam&#39;s bouncing bosom just long enough to almost get accidently hit by a car.&lt;/p&gt;[[Head on to campus]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Look at your friends" tags="" position="4394,645" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan has been one of your friends for as long as you can remember, he grew up a few houses down from you and you two spent a lot of time outdoors going on various random adventures.  Evan is tall and skinny, with a mop of dark hair he likes to keep trimmed short.  He is usually friendly, although not exactly known for his charisma.  He is also more than a bit of a perv.  While not much of an athlete, he usually spends a lot of time watching and playing sports as well as sport themed games.&lt;/p&gt;

[[Drew...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Ignore him" tags="" position="4250,952" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You sigh and give Mitch a look of pitty, ignoring him as best you can as you try to walk by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He slings some unoriginal insult your way but his words fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

[[Go to class]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Fight back" tags="" position="4555,948" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You look at Mitch and shake your head sadly as if he was a child throwing a tantrum.  You walk by, pretending to ignore him until the last second you reach into your backpack and grab hold of an eraser.  With one fluid motion, you whip the projectile at Mitch&#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/eraser.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitch looks up at the last moment, only to have the thick chunk of eraser ricochet off his head with a loud //thwack//, before it bounces off his brow and hits the floor.  Many of the students waiting for the doors to open laugh at Mitch. The last thing you see before slipping inside is his malevolent, black-eyed stare, silently vowing revenge.&lt;/p&gt;[[Go to class]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Go to class" tags="" position="4396,1096" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/class.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take your seat in between Evan and Drew.  You give each a nod and a grin as you sit down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That Mitch guy is such a dick,” Evan observes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yep,” you absently agree as you remove a pen and paper from your pack and prepare for class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hey Taylor,” Drew interjects.  “How are you today?  You look a little rough around the edges,” he opines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I was--ah, nevermind it isn’t worth getting angry over.  I was just a little behind schedule is all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seemingly satisfied with your response, Drew nods.  “What level did you get to?” he asks you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fifty-two,” you answer with a laugh, eager to be on a different topic. You and Drew have played games together for as long back as you can remember. You have long ago lost count of the titles crushed beneath your merciless combined skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As class begins, Drew stops speaking and rigidly faces forward.&lt;/p&gt;[[Look at your professor]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Go with Drew" tags="" position="4894,1741" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;The explosions from //World War Ten// ripple across the on screen battlefield. Your aggressive assaults down the center through a narrow canyon have placed Drew on the back foot but he is a crafty opponent that you are aware you should not underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as your drone fleet is about to shatter his last line of defense, he calls in some stupid “orbital strike” bullshit right into the middle of your advancing troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/orbital.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is fucking gay!” you howl in frustration as all hope of victory crumbles away in a beam of azure iridescent space-fire.&lt;/p&gt;

[[Complain about how gay the game&#39;s shitty mechanics are]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Go with Evan" tags="" position="4750,1739" size="100,100">You decide to go with Evan and play some soccer, hoping the exercise will dull your frustrations.
After a quick warm up jog to the fields, you and Evan arrive ready to play.

Jimmy, a notable figure at campus parties, along with a few other students are already  playing soccer on the field when you arrive.  There isn’t quite enough of you for a full game, but you and Evan soon join the fray and have a blast running around and chasing the ball.  You feel a bit like a dog playing fetch as you run back and forth, but soon find yourself having more fun than you expected.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ball.png&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Evan shoots you the soccer ball and you stop it with the side of your foot.  Just as you go to shoot it back to him, you suddenly feel a crippling pain in your stomach and you nearly miss the kick.  You double over in pain.

Evan looks concerned and runs over to you.  “You okay, Taylor?  You don’t look so good.”

[[Try and steady yourself]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Hang around School" tags="" position="4339,1442" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You decide to stay on Campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sorry guys.  I have a few things to catch up on.  No games until I study,” you tell Evan and Drew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still too early to slack off in your estimation.  You wave at your friends as they awkwardly avoid looking at each other and depart in opposite directions.  Soon you find a quiet spot in the nearby atrium and flip open a textbook.  After about an hour of studying, you happen to look up and notice a beautiful blonde girl slip into Mr. Deter’s lecture hall.  You thought that was sort of unusual.  *It should be empty at this hour.*  Mr. Deter wasn’t the sort to go out of his way to help students either, at least not without wanting something in return.  You hope nothing bad is happening to the girl, not that you have any reason to be concerned aside from Mr. Deter being a huge creep in general.  You recall him giving a lecture about the “psychology of biology,” a class with several sexist conclusions, many of which that were hard to argue against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After another few minutes you find your attention slipping off the page as you read it, forcing you to reread a sentence several times.  You stand up and stretch out your limbs, feeling surprisingly stiff and sore for a couchpotato.  Even your hands seem to ache lately.  You idly hope you don’t have carpal tunnel or some bizarre early onset arthritis.  As you work out a knot in your arm, you happen to spot Mitch through a window as he sneaks by.  You watch him move around outside, amazed at how shady he looked, shooting constant paranoid glances in all directions.  You make an internal bet that he is high on something.  *I wonder how the fuck he hasn’t been expelled or arrested….*  You move and stand by the window as Mitch ducks behind a tree and turns in your direction.  Mitch notices you and his bloodshot eyes flash.  He mouths the words, “fuck you,” before disappearing around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a moment you decide to:&lt;/p&gt;

[[Continue studying]]
[[Follow the blonde]]
[[Follow Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Go home and fap" tags="" position="4046,1644" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You have better things to do today than talk to your loser friends.  You ditch them and head home to fap.  Yet, somewhere about the halfway point home, you suddenly feel sick to your stomach.  You pause on the edge of the sidewalk hoping the pain will fade but it only worsens and spreads throughout your extremities.  Worst of all, and super weird to think about, is the fact you suddenly have a piercing pain directed at your junk, as if your genitals had been showered in sharp needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to scream but you bite your tongue, buckle down, and endure, staggering bravely home.&lt;/p&gt;
[[Go home and weather the storm]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Continue studying" tags="" position="4600,1840" size="100,100">You choose to continue studying.  With a stifled yawn you flip through assorted textbooks and notes.  You soon find yourself becoming bored.  Or more accurately, you become distracted by a strangely pervasive itch.  It starts out small but the more you scratch at it the more rapidly it expands until your back is covered with hives.  You are obviously having an allergic reaction to something.  You curse your luck, as you mentally catalogue your recent meals.  You don’t remember eating anything unusual but your body’s reaction is undeniable.

Feeling more nauseous by the second, you decide to:
[[Go to the campus medical center]]
[[Go home and weather the storm]]
[[Cut through the park]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Follow the blonde" tags="" position="3901,1547" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;On a whim, you decide to follow the blonde girl.  Perhaps it was her good looks or the way she looked //especially// nervous or maybe it was just a spurr of the moment response to your own boredom. Nevertheless, you tail the girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blonde slips into an office.  //Mr. Deter’s office!//  &quot;Hmmm...&quot;  //That is a bit unusual.// Mr. Deter was not known for his friendliness or long office hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hey Taylor!” calls a soft yet surprisingly energetic voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You spin around and see Samantha, a girl you have long fantasized about.  You have liked her for ages but every time you tried to speak to her in the past you end up tongue tied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sam2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“H-hey Sam!” you stammer in response.  Your eyes meet hers and you instantly feel the urge to look away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hi, Taylor!  What’s up?  Haven’t seen you around lately,” she says cheerfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I seen you this morning,” you admit and for a split second Sam looks confused and slightly weirded out.  “On the way to school,” you clarify.  “I saw you jogging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah I always try and get it over with before class.  I know I would be too lazy to do it afterwards!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heh, that is a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam&#39;s bright eyes dart around for a moment.  “Where is your little squad?  I rarely see you without Evan and...uh, what was the other guy’s name?  The bigger one?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drew,” you answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah he is kind of weird but seems nice,” Sam says and you find yourself nodding in agreement before she adds, “A bit like you!”  Sam giggles and that takes some of the sting out of her jibe but you feel yourself flushing with embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam watches your reaction for a moment. “Aw, I was just joking, Taylor!  I know you’re cool. You should hang out with us more often.  I know I am a bit introverted too -- if Rhea and Jimmy didn’t drag me out every weekend I doubt I would ever get out except for class and the occasional jog.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like that,” you reply.  “Hanging out I mean.”  You mentally facepalm.  Sam’s presence seems to sap all good sense from your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know what you mean!” she answers.  “I bet we have lots in common.  I heard from Evan you like //Defender of the Dragon Egg//, I love it too!  We should totally play some time,” she suggests.  Sam&#39;s brown eyes suddenly dart to a nearby clock and then go wide.  “Anyway cya-around-Taylor!” she says the last words quickly and is gone before you can muster a reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You watch Sam’s swaying backside depart from view with laser-like intensity, wishing there was a way that she could somehow become yours.  You have long imagined having a girlfriend exactly like her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sigh you shake your head.  Such a desire was an impossible fantasy.  Sam is completely out of your league and you know it.&lt;/p&gt;[[Go home and sulk]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Follow Mitch" tags="" position="4395,1649" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;Mitch’s paranoia has you curious.  You decide to see what sort of shady BS he is up to.  Being careful not to be spotted, you keep Mitch in sight but lag a long distance behind him.  He is soon on the edge of campus and enters one of the gardens next to a faculty building.  As you watch, you see him duck behind a “Do not enter” sign and slip in between two large bushes in one of the campus gardens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;//Okay now I am curious,// you admit as you move closer.  You enter the bushes and are just in time to see Mitch kneel down and hide something in a hole in the grass.  *A dead drop?*  You feel a thrill of excitement, like you are participating in a live action spy movie.  After kicking some leaves over the hiding spot, Mitch stands up and turns back towards you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;//Oh shit, he is coming back this way!//&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You crouch down and hold your breath.  Although he almost knocks you over as he leaves, Mitch does not seem to notice you as he passes you by.  You breathe a sigh of relief, glad for your slight build for one of the few times in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are sure Mitch is gone, you inch forward and quickly find what he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see a small black satchel, similar to a fanny pack.  Your heartbeat intensifies.  //A spy movie and hidden treasure!//  You open it up with trembling fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bag is filled with thousands of dollars of cash.  //Oh my god!  Jackpot,// you think.  Still, the money does belong to someone else and Mitch and whoever the money is intended for will likely be upset.  You’re not a thief by any measure but the allure of some extra cash is appealing and sticking it to Mitch might be a nice extra bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking things over, you decide to:&lt;/p&gt;

[[Take the money]]
[[Leave the money]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Take the money" tags="" position="4200,2300" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You recall a couple years ago that Mitch had broken into a bunch of cars, yours among them.  You could never prove it but it was him beyond a doubt, since he even bragged about it to several mutual friends on numerous occasions.  With that reminder, you feel no guilt as you scoop up the money and begin stuffing it into your bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as you turn around, you are horrified to see there is a large, hairy man standing in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You son of a bitch,” he says as he notices the contents of your open bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lips curl back in an angry snarl and you try and fight your way through the bushes while the giant man crashes after you in close pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fuuuuuuuuck!”  Everything was fine 10 minutes ago, now you are fleeing from a maniac.  *How the hell did this happen?* You frantically wonder just as your jacket gets snagged and you are thrown to the ground, the raging giant right behind you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You manage to struggle to your feet and fight off the grabbing branches of the bushes long enough to make one last attempt at freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stop!” yells your pursuer as you barely dodge a meaty hand and then use all your might to throw yourself from the bushes in one heroic leap….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You explode from the greenery right into the face of an oncoming car.  There is a moment of fleeting terror, a horrible bone crunching sound, and then only blackness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are dead.&lt;/p&gt;

With your heart still thundering in your chest, you claw your way through the bushes and head back to the atrium and then home, glad you made it of the situation unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;//Or mostly unscathed,// you think as you make it to the halfway point home and nearly double over with pain.  One moment you felt fine, the next you were nearly screaming in excruciating pain.  Just as you are about to sit down on the sidewalk and call out for help, you suddenly feel a wave of relief surge throughout your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is happening to me?  I am too young to die!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stumble towards your house as fast as you can.  However, by the time you arrive, an itchy rash has spread down your arms, a feeling so uncomfortable it makes your memories of chicken pox feel inconsequential.  As you step through the doorway, you become overwhelmed by an intense headache and nearly topple over.  Your headache is unlike any other you have felt before, a pain that felt like your skull was being compressed under immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;set $moneye to true&gt;&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Go home and weather the storm" tags="" position="3749,2301" size="100,100">You struggle to make it home but you make it alive.  You manage to guzzle some water and down a couple benadryl and a heaping handful of tylenol when you get back inside your house.  You sit down in your room and take a few deep breaths and gradually your nauseous feelings pass, but only temporarily.

That night they returned with a vengeance.  Just as you were about to lie down for bed, you suddenly feel exhausted and feverish.  You decide to take some cold meds, hope for the best, and close your eyes.  You snap awake a few hours later and are barely able to make it to the washroom before you start throwing up.  You give your offerings to the porcelain god until you have nothing left to give.  After emptying your stomach and dry heaving for an hour, you return to bed with chattering teeth.  As soon as you pull the covers over yourself, you are racked by a fit of shivering that does not subside even when you have wrapped yourself tightly in extra blankets and drenched your sheets with sweat.  Finally you fall asleep and sleep like a dead man.  When you finally wake up in the morning you feel even worse.  Despite sleeping soundly, you feel even more exhausted in the morning than you had before you went to bed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorsleepy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You brush an errant strand of hair from your face.  It seems abnormally long and ...thin.  //That is weird,// you think, recalling that you just had a haircut last week.  Your somewhat curly brown hair has always been coarse but the hair you are holding up now seemed oddly transparent.  //I hope I am not already going bald.  Please no…  I am too young!//   As soon as you stand up, you seem to wobble forward and are forced to brace yourself against the wall as an intense shooting pain in your abdominal area nearly drives you to your knees.  You find yourself unable to bear the agony of movement so just stand there hugging the wall, barely daring to breathe.  After a few minutes you feel even worse.  You suddenly feel flushed, cramped, and unbearably hot.

“I guess I am taking a sick day, ha-ha,” you mutter with near delirium.  You feel disgusting so decide to have a shower and clean up.  As you stumble forward and step into the washroom, you are shocked at the reflection that greets you in the mirror.

[[Look at your reflection]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Go to the campus medical center" tags="" position="4796,2445" size="200,200">You suddenly realize that you might in fact be dying.  You stumble towards the campus medical center, feeling like you might pass out at any moment.

Once you get near the emergency entrance, your vision becomes spotty. A moment later you are blinded by shifting dark blots.  You feel yourself falling and have a vague sense of impact but you feel oddly disconnected, like the experience is happening to another person entirely.  You see people around you but for some reason you cannot make out what they are saying to you despite their moving lips.  You try to speak to a frightened looking man in a white coat and try to tell him that you don&#39;t feel very well.  Yet, when you speak, no words of your own seem to come out.  The next thing you are conscious of is the blue of the sky above you as a ring of concerned faces surround you and look down upon you.

You are conscious of being jostled and moved.  Of bright lights beating down upon you and the sensation of being prodded and poked.

You feel feverish and sick.  You seem to drift in and out of conscious until a deep slumber finally consumes you.  You dream about puppies playing in fields of bright red poppies during the summer.

[[Fall into a deep sleep]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Go home and sulk" tags="" position="3796,1745" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;As you walk home your steps gradually slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh man I don’t feel so good,” you say as a sickly warm feeling spreads through your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stumble towards your house as fast as you can.  However, by the time you arrive, an itchy rash has spread down your arms, a feeling so uncomfortable it makes your memories of chicken pox feel inconsequential.  As you step through the doorway, you become overwhelmed by an intense headache and nearly topple over.  Your headache is unlike any other you have felt before, a pain that felt like your skull was being compressed under immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;[[Go home and weather the storm]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Look at your reflection" tags="" position="3910,2390" size="100,100">“Hmm?”

It was definitely your own face, only with a distinctly more feminine appearance.  It almost looked like a photoshopped picture or perhaps some sort of elaborate practical joke.

“What in the f--!?” you stammer but your own words catch you off guard- or rather your //tone// does.  Your voice sounds high and scratchy, completely unlike it usually does, more of a soprano than your usual tenor.

Your headache throbs and involuntarily draws a hand to your face, leading to another surprise.  Your skin feels soft and smooth.  Your jawline has obviously softened as well, while a shadow of soreness still remained, lurking beneath the surface like something that was aching in your very bones.  “What is going on?” you wonder.  You receive another shock when inspect your hands.  They seem smaller, dainty, almost //girly.// 

“What the hell is happening to me!?” you wonder with a growing feeling of terror.  Your hand brushes your chest and you feel an unfamiliar, slight bounce and a softness were there was once only firm muscle.

You slip your clothes off in a daze and turn back to the mirror.  Your eyes immediately focus on your chest, where both of your nipples and areola, along a small area around them, seem swollen.  Mind spinning, you turn back and step into the shower, letting the warm water wash over you.  The shower does not leave you feeling refreshed like it usually does.  It only seems to accentuate the growing pain within your hips and lower body.  As you let the water pelt you, your hand is drawn to your crotch, only to be snapped away as if you had touched a firebrand.  //What the fuck?  My dick feels...different…//   You have masturbated nearly every day for over ten years, so you are well aware something is wrong.  You slowly move your hand back and cup your shrinking manhood.  Even your testicles seem to have lost mass, more an empty bag of skin than anything else.

[[&quot;I don&#39;t feel so good...&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="“Oh my fucking god!  I have turned into a fucking girl!”" tags="" position="3912,2543" size="100,100">“Oh my fucking god!  I have turned into a fucking girl!” you yell at yourself when you are standing in front of the mirror.  

An undeniably beautiful young woman stares back at you, with bright brown eyes and mostly straight chin length chestnut hair framing an undeniably pretty face.  Your soiled boxers that you slept in hang off your body, threatening to fall to the floor, held back only by your unfamiliarly large hips.  The T-shirt you are wearing seems completely oversized and disproportioned.  Yet even through the loose fabric, your prominent breasts are undeniable and your figure, unmistakably female.

“This cannot be happening,” you tell yourself, but even several deep breaths and a very hard pinch does nothing to dispel your circumstances.

Stunned by your revelation and suddenly feeling weak in the knees, you sit down on the toilet.  You stare in disbelief at your swollen chest.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/boobs2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

[[This is fucking impossible!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Use your computer" tags="" position="3907,2846" size="100,100">You sit at your computer and load a new browser window.  “Oh yeah...there was a virus or something….” you mumble, recalling your last incident on the PC.  It had been a while since you were on your computer because you were busy with class and your sudden bout of sickness.

In the top section of the browser window it reads, “Transfigure has been successfully installed.”

“What the hell is //Transfigure?//” you wonder.  You don’t remember installing anything recently, at least not intentionally.  You google “Transfigure” and discover it means “to transform or uplift into something more beautiful and elevated,” yet your next searches can find no trace of a program or app with the same name.  A search of your hard drive comes up empty.  You glance at your computer’s digital clock and do a double take.  You have somehow lost an entire two days.

“I slept for //two// days!?”  //Is it even possible to sleep for two whole days?//  You remember one time this past summer where you stayed up for five days straight on a gaming marathon.  You slept like a log afterwards but for only for fourteen hours at most and that included a bathroom break.  To sleep for forty eight straight hours seemed like something someone on their deathbed would go through.  //But maybe that is right... Have I been reborn?  Is reincarnation a real thing?//

The sound of a bus outside causes you to snap back into reality.  Classes will start soon and you can’t afford to miss anymore unless you are planning on dropping out and flipping burgers.  You look down at your new breasts and feel an instinctive urge to cover them.  You also became conscious of the fact that you //stink.//  You find yourself [[drawn back to the bathroom.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Find something to wear" tags="" position="3908,2992" size="100,100">You eventually head back into the hall and open the door to your sister’s room.  It is a bit of a mess but you soon find a pair of jeans and a T-shirt style top that fits and still feels similar to your usual clothing, although you note that the clothes feel tighter across the chest and ass and a lot more clingy.  With a glance at the errant bras spread around the room, as if dispersed by a clothing tornado, you silently promise yourself to avoid such garments if at all possible.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/jeansass.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Although the new masses on your chest shift uncomfortably, //with every fucking step,// there is no way in hell you are wearing a bra.  Just as you are about to leave, you notice a pair of shorts on the floor that look similar to your regular boxers. although obviously meant for a slightly smaller person.  You hold them up with distaste, but decide it is better to have something that fits than going commando.

With a confirmatory glance in the mirror you turn to head out.  You look normal…  A normal //girl…//  //Fuck!//

[[Go to school like usual]]
[[Go to the fucking hospital!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="“What the fuck indeed,” you reply." tags="" position="3916,3139" size="100,100">“//Taylor!?//  What happened to you!?” he asks you with wide eyes.  His reaction would have been funny to you if the situation weren’t so serious.

It was an impossible question to answer.  You clearly need help, so you decide to tell Evan the truth.  “I wish I knew!  I have been sick the past couple days and when I woke up...I was like this,” you lamely explain, conscious of how ridiculous your explanation sounds.

“”Like this,” Evan repeats.  “Are you...?  You know?” Evan mumbles an unspoken question, staring at your chest and the crotch of your sister’s tight jeans.

“Yeah...I have turned into a girl,” you admit.  “Somehow.”  //Honesty is the best approach!//

“Like, uh….//Completely?//”

You sigh.  “Yep.”

“This is…This is...”  //Awful//, you mentally answer for him.  “Amazing!” Evan finishes his sentence with a note of glee.

“W-what?” you stammer.

“You are even hotter than your sister -- and she is a fox!  You’re so lucky!  All this time chasing hot chicks and now you finally caught one,” he jokes.

You are unsure how to reply to that.  You see Drew enter the hallway and wave him over.

Drew stops dead and looks quite confused.  He approaches slowly, looking more than a bit nervous.  “Julie, Evan,” he says with a nod, barely making eye contact.  “Taylor sick today?” he asks before he does a double take and his head snaps back to you.  His expression morphs between confusion, and then shock, as his eyes study your face and figure.

Aghast, Drew squints at you for a long time, then begins to blink rapidly.

“Earth to Drew!  I am right fucking here!” you answer.

“Well, judging by the potty mouth, that’s Taylor all right,” Drew concludes.  “This is remarkable.  How is such a thing p-”

“Fuck off,“ you interrupt.

“Just sounds so strange hearing those kinda words come from such a pretty mouth!” Evan comments.

The sheer immensity of your friend’s stupidity causes you to step back and attempt to gather your composure.  If you wanted help from these dimwits you were probably being too optimistic.  Still, the idea of explaining your transformation to a medical professional is enough to tie your stomach in knots.

[[Look around the atrium]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Go into the classroom" tags="" position="3911,3290" size="100,100">“I … uh...have to go…” you manage to tell him and step away, glad to be lost in the flood of people entering and exiting the lecture hall.

Class is uneventful except for the moment during roll call when Mr. Deter calls your name.  

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/class.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Taylor Roux,” Deter calls out, his beady eyes scanning the crowd.  You hope this doesn’t get out of hand.  The last thing you want is to be accused of impersonating...yourself.  But you had considered this and sat near the back in your usual spot.  You hope all Mr. Deter sees is the wave of your hand.  He grunts and moves on to the next name and you feel a wave of relief wash over you.

[[After class...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Go to a soccer game with Evan" tags="" position="3349,3801" size="100,100">You decide to go to a soccer game with Evan.  You have been cooped up for too long and the prospect of some entertainment and possible exercise is appealing.

“Sure Evan!  I will come for a game,” you say with what you hope sounds like enthusiasm.  Sports were never among your biggest interests.

Drew seems a bit disappointed with your choice.  He mumbles something about video games, a pincer attack with armoured divisions, and a black dragon that needs slaying.  With a sigh, he says goodbye and waddles off, leaving you and Evan alone.

Evan shrugs.  You begin to walk towards the campus fields side by side with your friend.  You feel a bit self conscious, for the way your body moves seems to accentuate your new curves.  Your stride seems to have naturally shifted and you feel your butt and breasts bounce subtly with each step.  You feel like a foreigner in your own body.

//Perhaps that is a good thing,// you decide.  Your body may have changed but your mind was completely intact.  There was no way you would ever feel comfortable in a body that was not your own.  //But it is still mine,// you correct yourself.  //It is just … different…// 

While your body plays havoc with your mind you notice Evan, standing at an abnormal height above you.  You look up at him.  //Wait.  Was Evan always so huge?//  That was the moment it hit you.  Evan had always been a tall guy that had towered over you.  Yet now the difference was even more stark.  Evan was now well over a foot taller than you and the difference was just one more constant reminder of your transformation and change in circumstance.

Evan sees you looking at him and shoots you his trademark lopsided grin.  

The two of you arrive at the soccer fields, positioned near the edge of campus.  You see a small group of people, noting a few familiar faces.  You recognize 
&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Jimmy&quot; &quot;Jimmy desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, a common sight at parties, and &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Rhea&quot; &quot;Rhea desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, a stunning blonde woman clearly proud of her beauty.

[[Walk up to the group]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Go play videogames with Drew" tags="" position="3095,3747" size="100,100">After a short bus ride and a short dash up a flight of stairs, you soon arrive at Drew’s place.

You can’t help but notice Drew’s red face as you wait for him to lumber up the last few steps.  For a moment you brush it off as him being out of shape but the mental deflection makes you pause.  A part of you wonders if he was checking you out as you shimmed up the stairs in your tight jeans.  As you brush off the idea, your eyes meet Drew’s.

“Why are you staring at me?” you ask him.

“You’re just so...so...//pretty//,” he responds lamely.

You raise an eyebrow. “What the hell?  That is kind of a weird thing to say.”

“You know I always had a thing for your sister,” Drew admits.  “But she is kind of…”

“Mean?” you suggest.  “A bitch?”

“Yeah….”

“Hah!  OWNED!” you exult as Drew’s car flies off the track during his moment of distraction.  “I win, you lose,” you tease Drew.  His heart doesn’t seem into it today, even though Drew is normally a video game messiah.

Drew awkwardly shifts position on the couch.  You notice an obvious boner outlined through his sweatpants.  //What the fuck?// You think, shocked at the idea that Drew would look at you and become aroused.  //I guess I do look a bit different now though,// you admit, finding it a bit hard to get too mad at him since you could easily relate.  //Still, what a fucking perv!//  You resolve to be a bit more careful around men in your new body.  Friend or foe, everyone seems to treat you differently.

[[Focus on the game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Head home" tags="" position="3801,3743" size="100,100">“Thanks guys,” you tell your friends.  “But I am going to see what I can find out on my own.”

“Sure, call us if you need anything,” Drew offers.  “I will make a list tonight of some doctors and hospitals.”

“Thanks, I appreciate it.”

Your day has already contained far too much excitement.  You decide to go home and rest.  //Maybe I can find a few leads on the internet,// you hope.

Your walk home is uneventful until you arrive.  When you turn the corner to your house your stop dead.

//Is that… Mitch?//  You’re surprised to see him.  He is literally the last person you would expect to see at your house.  It is also more than a tad disturbing that he knows where you live.

//Why the hell is he standing in front of my door?//  You have a very bad feeling about his presence.

&lt;&lt;if $moneye is true&gt;&gt; //I hope he didn’t find out about the money!// Yet if he was aware you suspected, you suspect he wouldn’t be waiting for you in such an open manner.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Mitch definitely looks out of place standing with his “alternative” style standing amongst the ordered and well maintained background of your parent&#39;s rental property.
[[Go greet Mitch]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="No fucking way!  Not a chance in hell!" tags="" position="3947,4090" size="100,100">//What?  No way!//

You laugh in his face.

“Haha-HAHA!  That is hilarious.  No fucking way, faggot!  I am a GUY!  Stay the fuck away from me you gay creep!” you yell at him as you push past Mitch and slam the door shut behind you, locking it tightly for good measure.  

Mitch becomes furious.  “You-you-//tranny bitch!//” Mitch yells at you in a rage.  You glance out the window at him and can see he is so angry that he is actually shaking.

After a moment of looking like he will attempt to break down your door, he clenches his hands into fists and slinks off down the street.  You breathe a sigh of relief when he is gone from view.

You spend the rest of the evening searching the web but find nothing of value.  Eventually you get a message from Evan inviting you out to one of the bars tonight.  You kind of want to go but the idea of going to such an establishment in your female body makes you uncomfortable.  A bunch of drunk, horny men in an enclosed space…What could go wrong?  Still the bar is close and it is a classy place.  You remember that there are always lots of girls present; they wouldn’t be there if it was a dangerous place.

You chide yourself for being so uptight and decide a stiff drink is exactly the thing you need tonight.

[[Go to the bar]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="We might be able to make a deal" tags="" position="3695,3897" size="100,100">You sigh.  You are pretty certain Mitch will never leave you the fuck alone unless you firmly but gently explain the two of you will never have any possibility of romance.  You&#39;re both straight, so there is nothing to say.  You are not gay and never will be.

&quot;Maybe we can work something out…&quot; you answer.  &quot;But you&#39;re buying.&quot;

&quot;Really!?  Of course.  What are you doing right now?&quot; Mitch asks you with an almost creepy level of childlike excitement.

It is still early and you are free to do as you please, but the prospect of even briefly hanging out with Mitch turns your stomach.  Still, you figure it is probably best to nip this problem in the bud before it grows into something more perverse.

[[Agree to have coffee with Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Go to the bar" tags="" position="3795,4187" size="100,100">You walk to the bar and move to head inside.  As you do you slow down as you catch sight of the bouncer.  *Fuck.  This is the guy who wouldn’t let me in last week without black shoes and a collared shirt.  What an asshole.*  You look down at the green coloured T-shirt top you wearing and grit your teeth.

“Wait a sec,” you say to yourself.  “Fuck!  I brought my wallet but….”  It hurt to even say aloud.  “My ID…”  You hold out your card and look at Taylor Roux’s handsome face.  Your male face.  A face which you now do not possess.

“Well shit, how am I going to even get in there?” you wonder.  Stumped, you momentarily ponder your options.  //I guess I just have to hope I don’t get carded.//

You stand up straight and march forward with as much confidence as you can muster.

The bouncer bars your path.

“Excuse me, miss, may I see some ID please?” he asks you.  You are a little bit taken aback.  He was much less polite with you the last time you were here.

“I am just meeting some friends inside,” you insist, attempting to deflect his request.

He gives you a toothy grin.  “Going dancing with some friends?” he enquires.

“Dancing?  Fuck no,” you respond a little too quickly.  The bouncer raises an eyebrow at your sudden profanity.  “Sorry I am a bit late though… I am going to go meet my friends,” you explain.

“Sure thing but you need to show me your ID first,” he repeats his request.

“Oh come on, cut me some slack.”

The bouncer balked.  “I am already,” he insisted.  “I am not charging you cover and I haven’t mentioned you’re a little under-dressed because you are super hot.”

“W-what?”  His compliment catches you off guard.  You feel your face start burning.  You could really use that drink you came for.  “Fine,” you say as you hand over your ID.

The bouncer glances at your photo for a microsecond and scans your ID on a nearby terminal.

“Have fun!” the bouncer says as he hands you your card back.

[[Enter the bar]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Take it easy" tags="" position="4105,4443" size="100,100">You decide to take it easy and head home early.  You had a great time but realize there is so no sense in pushing your new body before you are aware of its limitations.

Once home you go to bed and sleep soundly until you wake up to the sound of someone calling your name.

[[Respond to the voice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Party until your worries disappear" tags="" position="3802,4441" size="100,100">You down your third drink and rustle up a fourth.  You are feeling mellow, socially lubricated, and confident.

“Woooow!  At least I won’t have to spend much to get drunk!” you brag to your friends.

“No, a pretty thing like you definitely won’t have to,” agrees a voice.  A handsome stranger hands you another drink.

You graciously accept and soon find that one drink leads to another.  You soon lose count and, before you know it, you are completely, blissfully hammered and the world is spinning around you.

It felt so good to have the stress of the past couple days evaporate.

Yet eventually you begin to feel a bit //off//.  For the second time this week, you feel yourself drawn to washroom.  You leave your friends behind and stumble forward, barely making it to a stall in the men’s room.  You hover over the toilet and find yourself unable to throw up. Instead, you just feel dizzy and tired, bracing yourself against the toilet, staring down at the water in the bowl for what seems like an eternity.

//Kahcha.//  You hear the bathroom door open and footsteps approach.  Although mostly in your own little world, you are aware of someone approaching.

[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Wake up" tags="" position="3804,4761" size="100,100">When you wake up the next day you have a splitting headache.  You are at home in your room but you don’t remember the walk back, nor half the night for that matter.  

“Ugh.”  You feel absurdly hung over.  As you lie back down in bed you notice a red light on your phone, a missed message.  

“Ow my head… What the fuck happened last night?” you wonder as pick a long strand of hair from your face.  All your memories seem to be clouded in fog. 

You pick up your phone and tap the text message section.  Your mouth nearly hits the floor when you see the first message.  

“No!  How can this be?”
[[Look at the message]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Think about how to respond." tags="" position="3804,4904" size="100,100">
//I am going to fucking kill him!  Even a 100 lb girl could kill someone with a rock,// you gleefully fantasize.  You choose to respond to the message and go to the east dorm, more to confront Mitch than anything.

A few hours later, dressed in jeans and a borrowed sweater, you go to meet Mitch behind the east dorm.  You notice him leaning next to a dumpster in a secluded area most students use to smoke pot.

“Hey Taylor!” Mitch cheerily greets you as you walk up to him.  “I knew you couldn’t resist meeting me again.  Last night was fate.”

Barely resisting the urge to strike, you drop the rock you were carrying.  Going to jail for murder would do little to improve your circumstances.  Mitch should be the one in jail, but you&#39;re not sure how you could make that happen either.  You look up at Mitch and scowl at him, crossing your tiny arms over your breasts.  “Mitch, you are such a fucking creep!” you castigate him.  “What are you some kind of evil rapist now?  I want you to delete those pictures--//now//--you asshole!” you screech your demand of him.

He shrugs.  “Okay,” he agrees without a fight.  &quot;I will delete them.&quot;

“Really?”  His response catches you off guard. Yet you are still more than skeptical  “That easy?  Do it then.”

“Well I want something in return of course,” he admits.

You sigh, sure of his likely suggestion.  You look around and see no one.  Suddenly you feel exposed and vulnerable. 

[[Ask him what he wants]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Ask him what he wants" tags="" position="3940,4989" size="100,100">You sigh.  &quot;What do you want?”

“Well Taylor you might guess where this is going, heh.  I want you to give me a really good blow job that I will never forget.  Then I will delete the pictures for you, I promise.”  Mitch nods solemnly as if to say, “You can trust me!”

You almost laugh.  “No fucking way!” you answer without hesitation.

“Well then Taylor this will soon be all over the internet!  Everyone on campus will know of Taylor Cumtits, the immortalized genderbent slut!”

“You would go that far?  Why would you do that to me?”  The prospect was indeed horrifying.  “Fuck off.  How the hell can I trust you-especially after last night?”

“Hey I am honest and I always keep my word.  I have a well established //reputation.//  People always get what they pay for.  It is well known my word is gold around here.  I say something happens and it happens.”  His dark eyes narrow at you.  “Now Taylor are you going to suck my dick or become //famous?//” Mitch asks you with a leering grin.

With no good options available to you, you decide to…

[[Suck his dick]]
[[Punch him in the face]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Suck his dick" tags="" position="13010,10645" size="100,100">You can see that there is no easy way out of this situation.  With a heavy heart and a feeling of despair, you decide to agree to Mitch&#39;s demand.  //Wow, I am literally fucked.  I have been a girl for less than a week and already I am getting blackmailed for blow jobs.  What the fuck is wrong with me--or the world for that matter?  I don’t want this to happen!//  //I am trapped by this fucking asshole!  God damnit!  But this is probably my best shot at getting those pictures deleted,// you admit to yourself.  //But can I even do this?// You cannot help but wonder.  You already feel sick to your stomach, overwhelmed a level of anxiety you have never felt before.  You want nothing more than for this to be over as soon as possible.

Mitch is staring at you expectantly.

“I-I’ll do it you stupid prick,” he finally claws the words from you.

“Yeah, you will do my stupid prick all right!” he laughs.  “But I want you to say it.”

“Say what?”

“What you are going to do.”

“What?”

“Say it.  Say: “Mitch, I want to suck your dick,”” he orders you.

You bite your lip, briefly imagining kicking him in the balls.  Yet you have already committed and every second you spend arguing is only going to prolong this ordeal.

“I //don’t// though!”

“If you want these pictures deleted, then yes you do.”

You swallow and stare at the ground.  //Fuck my life.//  “Mitch...I want to suck your dick,” you repeat the words.  You feel a flush creep up your cheeks.  Your ears are burning.  You have never felt more humiliated or ashamed before in your entire life.  But you know that things will only get worse.  You expect to make several new record lows tonight.

“Say it again and look me in the eyes this time!” Mitch commands you. &quot;C&#39;mon, Taylor!  Do as I say!&quot;

“Mitch, you fucking asshole, I want to suck your dick and get this awful moment in my life over with!  There, happy?”

Mitch laughs.  “That was pretty hot.  Good enough.”

Mitch begins walking away.  He motions for you to join him on the other side of the dumpster.

[[Walk over to Mitch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Punch him in the face" tags="" position="3805,5107" size="100,100">&quot;You fucking scumbag!&quot; you scream at Mitch, your loud, shrieking voice shocking even you.  Mitch takes a step back but you have already taken one forward and let him have an uppercut to the jaw, delivered in near perfect form despite your small size.  Mitch&#39;s head snaps up and he staggers backwards but manages to steady himself before falling completely.  He finally recovers enough for you to see the look of immense anger in his eyes, but it is already too late.  Your next strike hits him right in the middle of his nose.  You capitalize upon his brief disorientation and repeatedly punch him in the face until your bloody hands are shaking too much to strike at him.   Finally satisfied, you stand up and remove the sim card from Mitch&#39;s cellphone before crushing it with your heel for good measure. You leave the miserable scumbag lying between the dumpsters like a piece of trash.

“Prick!” 

[[Head back home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Walk over to Mitch" tags="" position="13163,10692" size="100,100">As you walk up to him he flashes you a shit-eating grin and forces you to your knees with a gentle downward push on your shoulders.

A second later, with a zip and a tug, his massive erection flops free of his pants and nearly clubs you in the face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dpic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//I-it’s fucking huge!//  Your eyes go wide and you are completely taken aback by the sober reality of your commitment.  //It is more than double the size that mine used to be!//

“Oh god, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this huge thing?”

“Pretty impressive, eh?  You’ve watched porn before and probably a few blowjob videos….”  //A few…//you wryly admit.  BJ videos used to be your favourite but you never thought you would be forced to experience it from this perspective.   “So consider that training, Taylor.  Just imitate.  Start by kissing the tip and roll your tongue over the head.  And use your other hand to jerk me off.”

You didn’t think it was possible, but you feel even more worthless and humiliated as you move your lips towards his member.  //I can’t believe I am fucking doing this, what the hell is wrong with me?  How did it come to this?// You can’t help but wonder, as your tiny mouth descends towards Mitch’s cockhead and its glistening bead of ample pre-cum.

Just before your lips make contact, you can’t help but pause and pray for a lightning strike to obliterate you from this awful moment.  As Mitch’s musky scent wafts over you, you fight the urge to gag.  It seems you are about to cross a line and entering a realm of which there may be no return.  Yet you have already committed, the two of you are hidden from prying eyes, and you are already on your knees with a cock so close to your mouth.  If there is a chance you are stuck in this form forever you will need your reputation intact.  But what would actually going through with this awful deed do to your reputation, if word ever got out?  //I must ensure Mitch keeps his word.//  And the only way to get those pictures destroyed is...to do as he asks.

[[Complete the blackmail bargain]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Demand Mitch delete the pictures he took" tags="" position="13151,10986" size="100,100">“Now delete those pictures,” you say to Mitch angrily as you stand up and wipe your mouth clean with the back of your sleeve.

Mitch immediately balks at your suggestion.  “Nah, no way!  That wasn’t even close to being good enough.  You didn’t even swallow it all, look at your shirt.  See, you missed some cum there.  That is maybe like a C+ blowjob at best, Taylor.  That is not what we agreed on.”

“You seemed to enjoy it, you perv!” you object.

“I am a guy, I would enjoy any company from a girl like you, let alone a BJ,” he reasons.

“I am a guy too!” you yell at him.

Mitch just looks down at you with a look of pity, his penetrating gaze finally resting on your breasts.  “That was pretty good for your first time.  Don’t worry, I am confident you will improve.  Even once our little business is over you can always keep practicing on me anytime you get a cock craving!”

“As if!”

“Not like you have a choice, Tay.  Meet me at my apartment after class tomorrow.  Ditch those losers you call friends.  I’ll text you the address.  Then we can hopefully conclude our business.  Don’t worry little Taylor, you’re almost there.  Don’t despair, I am not a complete bastard!  I intend to keep my word.  See ya tomorrow!” he says joyfully as he strides out of view, whistling a merry tune.  He leaves you standing by the dumpster with the foul taste of his cum lingering on your lips.

You have never hated anyone more in your life but you feel helpless and can think of no way out of your predicament except submission.

[[The next day...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="The next day..." tags="" position="13012,11089" size="100,100">“I can’t believe I have to do this again,” you say as you head to the address Mitch gave you. 
You are soon standing in front of Mitch&#39;s apartment.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/apartment.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
// I feel trapped.  Being blackmailed is the worst!  What the fuck I am I supposed to do!?  How do I get out of this?//

“Hey Taylor!  Right on time!” Mitch says as he opens the door and lets you into his filthy apartment.  There are empty pizza boxes, stacks of dirty dishes, and liquor bottles nearly everywhere, along with a random assortment of garbage covering most surfaces of the room except the couch and a small spot on the coffee table.

He motions for you to take a seat on the couch and you do so after pushing aside some burger wrappers.  You turn to Mitch and he smiles at you as he takes out a massive three foot long bong and sets it on the table.  He then takes out the largest bag of weed you have ever seen and packs a massive bowl after grinding up a large bud.  

It is university, so you have been known to partake on occasion, but that bong and bowl is //huge//.  Not to mention the fact you don’t exactly trust Mitch’s supply or motivation.  You’re used to an occasional toke on a joint on the nights you drink excessively, not dealing with that spiraled, glass monster.  Still it might be a good idea to zone out for a while… Anything that makes time pass by more quickly would probably be a big help in getting you through this ordeal.

[[Consider getting high]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Get it over with" tags="" position="13006,11249" size="100,100">You feel a tingle in your legs and close your eyes in a moment of rare relaxation.  When you open them again Mitch’s giant erection is poised right in front of your face.  The pungent odor of his groin assaults your nose as he presses his member forward in between your waiting lips.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchjerk.gif&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
“Oh yeah!” he sighs as you roll your tongue over his cock’s head and try and force as much of his thick shaft down your throat as possible.  He gives you several long, painful thrusts that nearly make you gag.  With a moan of pleasure, he thrusts most of his length inside you but does not withdraw.  Your eyes bulge.

Mitch holds you in place as his phallus blocks your airway and you choke and sputter until he finally releases his cock from your mouth.  You gasp and inhale desperately as soon as your throat is clear.  You look up at him with a look of malice and he just grins back at you, clearly pleased at the power he has over you.  You feel his hand push you firmly back to his manhood.

“C’mon, put some more effort into it.  Do it like you have a time limit.  Hey, that’s a good idea!  Make me cum in three minutes and I promise you are off the hook for good, Taylor.”

[[Look at Mitch&#39;s leaking dick]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Later on..." tags="" position="13010,11555" size="100,100">//&quot;You’re late.  Where are you?&quot;// Reads a text from Mitch.  You stand outside his apartment, a run-down building just off campus.  As you look up at the fourth floor you already feel wretched inside before even entering the building.  You want to run away, to prevent this awful chain of events from progressing any further. Walking up to him and submitting sober and in the middle of the day, seems a terrifying prospect.  Yet you have already done it before.  

With a sigh and a silent reassurance this will be your last time at his apartment, you head into the lobby.  “I am here,” you say, speaking to the intercom.  The door buzzes open and you walk upstairs, each step slow and heavy, as if you are trying to drag out the journey.  But there was no delaying the inevitable.

As you approach the door, you smell the unmistakable skunk like odor of marijuana.  You knock at the door and hear a muffled confirmation from inside.

Five seconds later, you are standing before Mitch, arms crossed over your breasts.

“Heeey Taylor!  Lookin’ good, babe!”

“Don’t call me that!&quot; you snap.  &quot;You know why I am here.”

“Oh I know.  How about the same deal as last time?”

“Three minutes?”

“Three minutes or less,” he confirms.  “And then all the pictures will be deleted.”

“You swear?  I want you swear on your family’s lives.”

“You have my word.  I do so solemnly swear,” Mitch adds with a smile and a flourish of his hand.

“Fine, let’s fucking get this over with,” you say as you move towards him.

“You want a drink or a bowl first?  Or straight to the action?”

“No, fuck off.  I just want this to end,” you reply.

“Fair enough,” Mitch says as he takes out his cellphone and flips to the stopwatch.  He then begins to unbuckle his pants.

[[Accept your fate]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Accept your fate" tags="" position="13161,11597" size="100,100">You look at his hardening cock with a feeling of regret.  You can almost feel the last vestiges of your pride slipping away as you take his hardening manhood in hand.

“Aaaand go!” says Mitch and you begin to work on his cock, putting to use everything you’ve seen in porn and learned from your own encounters.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deepthroat6.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You try and accept as much of him inside your mouth and throat as possible, while suppressing your urge to gag.  You do your best deepthroat imitation while Mitch seems lost in pleasure.

[[You feel caught up in a moment of madness]]

“Cool, I’m Jimmy, nice to meet ya Taylor!  That’s Rhea, you know Evan...”  Several others throw their names forth.  No one seems to recognize you and you feel momentarily relieved.  You don’t bother to correct Jimmy on the fact you have already met... several times.

You haven’t really had a chance to test out your new body’s physical endurance.  As you poke at your drastically reduced shoulders and arms, you feel like you have lost nearly all of your upper body strength compared to the way you were before.  Yet, perhaps your slender arms and legs meant you were light...and perhaps a bit quick as well.

“Okay, I’ll be a captain,” Jimmy declares, taking charge of the group.  “Evan can lead the other team.  Let’s choose.”  Jimmy and Evan play rock paper scissors, Evan’s paper defeating Jimmy’s rock.  “Pick first, Evan.”

“Sure.  I pick Taylor,” he says without any hesitation.  For a second you are shocked.  You’ve never in your entire life been picked first in a sport team.

“Awww!  That’s so sweet,” gushes Rhea, folding her arms over her ample chest.  “Jimmy, be a sweet guy and pick me next.”

Jimmy raises an eyebrow, balking at the idea.  “Jacob,” he says, picking one of the athletic looking guys.

“Asshole!” Rhea curses.

“I pick Rhea, I want all the hot girls on my team!” Evan yells, announcing his pick and intention to build a soccer harem.

“He’s got good taste,” Rhea comments as she takes her place at your side.  Soon each team has five members.  Five athletic looking guys against Evan and his team consisting of a stoner, two girls, and…. //me...I guess that actually makes it three girls,// you lament.

Evan decides to put the stoner in as goaltender.  The guy gives you a lazy smile as he takes his position, his heavy lidded eyes barely even appear open.  You hope he is sober enough to deflect at least some of the shots that will no doubt shortly be headed his way.

[[Start the game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Start the game" tags="" position="3196,4045" size="100,100">“Let’s do this!” shouts Evan as he does the kickoff, blasting the ball down field with a long-legged kick.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ball.png&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
Soon you are lost in the moment, chasing after the soccer ball as it is kicked around the field.  You try and run as fast you can, darting around the field with a degree of agility you find impressive, for a moment at least.  Just as you feel yourself approaching what you think is your top speed, you are suddenly overwhelmed by your bouncing chest.  You find the movement not only to be very distracting but more than a bit painful as well.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/soccer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
There is a clash further down field.  The other girl loses the ball to Jimmy who breaks away and shoots the ball straight into the goal zone and past your barely moving goalkeeper.

The game continues in this fashion for quite awhile.

“Damn!  Team sausage-fest is rigged!” Rhea complains as the other team surges past your team’s defense and rapidly scores again.

[[You agree with Rhea]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Push your momentum!" tags="" position="3192,4192" size="100,100">The high of your momentary victory still pulsing through you, you turn and find Evan beside you.  He looks ecstatic that the game has been tied.  You go to high five him but he suddenly hugs you instead, pinning you to his chest.

“We did it!  We’re tied!  That was a freakin’ //amazing// shot, Taylor!” he compliments you.  You are suddenly conscious of the size and power difference between the two of you.  Something is indeed different and the embrace lingers just a bit too long for your comfort.  Your breasts had pressed into his chest, a process that made you alarmingly aware of their presence and sensitivity.  Even once you withdraw, you still feel the sensation of Evan’s muscular arms wrapped around you.

//Wait what the fuck? //You think, trying to snap yourself out of whatever bizarre delusion had seized you.  You then become conscious of Evan and Jimmy  staring at you.  You follow their line of sight down to your chest where you can clearly see your hard nipples and the outline of your modest but shapely B-cup breasts through the thin fabric of your shirt.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; you squeek, awkwardly crossing your arms to hide them.  //Damn pervs!//

You hear shouting but are lost in your own thoughts.

//Why the hell did Evan grab me like that?  I feel sort of weir--//  The ball goes whizzing by you, your legs suddenly feeling clumsy, causing you to miss the intercept.  Jimmy’s team quickly recovers the ball and returns it to the other side of the field, blowing by Rhea and shooting it into the net.

The game continues on, going back and forth.  You find yourself impressed with Evan’s athleticism.  You had always considered him more of a guy that watched or talked about sports or played their games rather than participated in the actual events.  

You find yourself a bit distracted during the remainder of the match but still put up a valiant effort.  In the end you are defeated 5-7.

“Good game!” shouts an out of breath Jimmy.

“Cya later lovebirds!” Rhea calls after you.

[[Leave with Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Leave with Evan" tags="" position="3349,4239" size="100,100">“Even though we lost I actually had a lot of fun,” you admit.

“Me too.  We almost had it!” Evan answers readily.

“Yeah, sorry I missed a few easy ones back there…”

“Hey, we play to have fun and we did that.  We make a really good team too I think,” Evan adds with a smile.

“We sure do.  It felt really good to unwind...to forget for a bit.”  //Yet it is only a temporary reprieve,// you think as you look down at the unfamiliar view of your ample cleavage blocking out much of your view of anything below.

“Yeah.  What are you going to do?  About your “situation” I mean?”

“I was sort of hoping you could help out with that.  The truth is I have no idea how this happened...or what to do now.  I don’t want to end up in some government laboratory or insane asylum.  I know your dad is a doctor and that your family has some connections.  Anything you could do for me or find out for me would be greatly appreciated.”

“For you Taylor, //anything,//” he answers earnestly.

“Thanks Evan, you’re an awesome friend.  I would do the same for you.  I owe you.”

“Well maybe there is something you could do for me.”

“Sure, anything --within reason.  I am not going to sleep with you or murder someone.”

Evan suddenly looks embarrassed.  //Ugh, did I hit close to the mark?// 

[[Listen to his request]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Show him your chest" tags="" position="3193,4553" size="100,100">Evan has worn you down with his stupidity.  You raise your shirt and flash him your breasts.  To your immense embarrassment, you notice your nipples and areola are red and chafed from bouncing around during your soccer game.

Your braless breasts bounce free for Evan&#39;s viewing pleasure.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/moreboobs.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“WOW!” Evan explodes after a sharp intake of breath.  His expression transforms into something you have never seen before.  He is //ecstatic,// completely enamored with your display.  //Apparently my breasts are on par with a flying saucer landing.//  Your best friend continues to stare at your chest with what you can only describe as rapture.

The delicious odor catches you off guard, as does the sudden appearance of the person cooking breakfast.  Your sister Julie, sets down the frying pan she is holding and turns in your direction.  “Finally you are up, Taylor,” she berates you as she turns around.  She freezes in surprise when she catches sight of you.

//Fuck.//  This was one moment you were dreading.  You had hoped you would be able to return to normal before your sister noticed your change.  You were unsure how Julie would react.  It had been hard enough explaining yourself to your friends, let alone your nutty and potentially violent sister.  You and Julie had always been somewhat distant.  You had very different personalities and interests.  Julie had been spending so much time with her boyfriend lately that you had not even seen her in almost a month.

Julie appears to be perplexed as she looks you over.  She blinks her eyes several times before she finally speaks.  “Do I know you?” she asks you.

“Uh….”

[[You decide to tell Julie the truth]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="You decide to tell Julie the truth" tags="" position="3999,6143" size="100,100">“Yes, you do.  It’s me, Taylor.  It sounds absolutely-fucking-ridiculous to say aloud but something happened to me and I got turned into a girl.”

Julie’s mouth had fallen open.  “Accidently?” she manages just a single word question.

“What do you mean!?  Of course it was an accident!  I didn’t want this to happen!  It wasn’t intentional if that is what you are getting at!”

Julie starts to giggle.  She starts slowly at first until her mirth grows into steady peals of laughter.  “Haha hahahaHAHAHA!  Oh wow Taylor, that is //hilarious//.”

“It’s not funny!”

“Yes, it is!” she teases.

“So how did this //“accidently”// happen?” Julie asks you.  You can clearly hear the air quotes.  Julie always knew how to get under your skin.

You sigh.  “I don’t know,” you reply.  You slowly begin to retell the events of the past days, minus a few naughty omissions.

“Well I see you helped yourself to my clothes,” she observes.  “I am not mad or anything.  I think you turned out super cute.  Us Roux ladies are all rather gorgeous.”

“Gee, thanks.”

“Oh don’t pout!  This is actually awesome news.  You and I could really spend some quality time together!”  Julie’s face brightens as a thought occurs to her.  “We could go shopping!  Play a little dress up, maybe?  Oh!  There are some many things I could show you.”  Julie approaches you and suddenly reaches out, grabbing a lock of your dark reddish-brown hair.  “Oh my god.  You have to let me braid this.  You have no idea how much I always wanted a sister!”

“I appreciate the offer, sis.  But what about Ryan?  You’ve been so busy lately…”

“Exactly.  I have spent enough time with Ryan lately.  Too much time!  He is great but getting a bit clingy.  Oh don’t worry, you know family //always// comes first with me!”

“Ready for some more fun, Taylor?” he asks you as you walk into the living room.  He motions for you to sit beside him.

“Wait we need to talk.  You said all you wanted was //a really good blowjob,// and I have given you //three!//”

“Good memory for a dumb slut.  Quality is subjective!  Your last one was getting there.  A few more times and you will probably be at the required level for our transaction.  All the rest is just //practice//.”

“You’re a slimy piece of shit, Mitch.”

“Oh Taylor I love your mouth.  Such dirty things always flowing in and out.  Now what will it be?  Is my dick going in your sweet little mouth or your tight little pussy today?”

Mitch sits up and looks at you.  He looks concerned, more earnest than you have ever seen him.  There is no trace of the usual smirking asshole.  
“A deal is a deal,” he says sadly, grabbing his phone and periodically flashing it to you as he deletes your photographs.  You are shocked at the number he had snapped of you that night at the bar and how far he had gone in molesting you.

You grab his phone and do a quick scroll of the files.  Your pictures appear to have been deleted.

You breathe the first sigh of relief in what seems like years.

You toss his phone back to him walk to the door before finally turn back to face Mitch.  “Goodbye forever you fucking degenerate asshole!  I hope you fall down a flight of stairs and all your pets die and every relationship and piece of crap you have breaks apart and explodes into acid fire that then burns you right in your stupid fucking face,” you add for good measure.

“Wow,” Mitch responds with amusement.  “Tell me what you really think!”

Just as you finally walk out the door, you suddenly feel Mitch’s hand on your shoulder.  You spin around and slap his hand off you.

“Taylor, where are you going?” he asks you sweetly, as if oblivious to the previous exchange of words.

“I am getting the fuck away from you like I should have done long ago!” you reply.

“You got the pictures back, Taylor.  But what about the //videos?//” Mitch throws the question at you like a javelin.

[[Videos?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Videos?" tags="" position="13157,12047" size="100,100">Your heart falls so low in that moment it feels like it now resides in your heels.  Your previous ray of hope, your momentary freedom, explodes into smithereens, a naive fantasy destroyed.

Your mouth feels completely dry.  “What videos?” you finally ask him.

“I kinda filmed us the first night at my place.  You earned the pics back, now you got to earn these, but bear in mind a video is worth a lot more than a picture.”  He smiles at you, the most wolfish, horrifying grin you have ever seen.  

“What’s the point?  You’re just going to make more shit to blackmail me!  Go die in a fire!  I am not doing anything else for you.”

“No, no!” Mitch protests.  “I am a man of my word.  I promise no more pics or videos without your express permission.”

“And what, you want like a hundred blowjobs in exchange!?”

He shrugs.  “If you are offering…”

“Fuck you!  I am leaving and I am never coming back.”  You turn and start walking away.  

“Just one night is all I want, Taylor.  Think about it.  It is not a bad deal and I know you’re interested.  I’ll keep a condom handy with your name on it!” he shouts after you, leading to several embarrassing looks from nearby residents as you storm outside and past several onlookers in the hallway.

You head home and lose yourself in petty entertainments for a couple days.  You have just about put your problems aside when you get a message.  You pick up your phone with a feeling of trepidation.  

[[See what Mitch sent you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="See what Mitch sent you" tags="" position="13008,12152" size="100,100">“Video attachment….”

The video plays, it is a passionate session of you sucking Mitch’s cock.

//Fuck, from this angle it even looks like I am enjoying it!//  “He fucking filmed us, that creep!  But why would he incriminate himself?...oh no...it would undermine any rape claim against him.  Now nobody will ever believe my story….fuck!”

The text underneath the video is asking your permission to publish it, noting that the content is probably worth a bit of cash to the right perverts.

You sit down, trying to imagine some possible way out of your predicament that doesn’t involve sleeping with your mortal enemy.  When you don’t respond after about ten minutes, Mitch sends you another message 

[[Look at the new message]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Decide what to do" tags="" position="13013,12298" size="100,100">You accept Mitch’s promise.  //One more night of hell and this will all be over//, you tell yourself, praying that it is true.

When you arrive at Mitch&#39;s apartment you find his place to be surprisingly clean.  He greets you with a ready smile and ushers you into the swelteringly hot living room.

“This is the last night I am coming here,” you inform him at the very start.  “Then everything you have gets deleted and we are done.”

“If that’s what you want, Taylor,” he agrees without a fight.  You raise an eyebrow.  “Let’s just focus on enjoying ourselves, for tonight you belong to me.”

You mentally deflate and sit down on the couch.

Mitch hands you a frozen drink.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drink.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You’re thirsty but suspicious so you only take a tentative sip at first.  You can’t taste any alcohol or anything unusual.  The fruity concoction tastes delicious and, before you know it, you’ve finished the entire thing.  Mitch walks to the kitchen and comes back with two fresh drinks.  You find Mitch&#39;s generousity to be a bit off-putting.
[[Drink more]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="Uh oh" tags="" position="13002,12451" size="100,100">“B-but I didn’t taste any alcohol!” you object.

“Exactly why chicks love these sorts of things,” he asserts.  “All the fun and none of the “icky” taste.  Personally I like it,” he adds as he sips his own drink, some sort of brown liquid on ice.  

You suddenly feel like all the previous drinks catch up with you at once.  You feel flushed and hot.  You can feel your ears smouldering with heat.  

You stumble to the bathroom and try and collect your composure.  After urinating and splashing your face with cold water, you stare at your reflection swaying in the mirror.

When you return to the living room Mitch is loading up his bong.  “Want a rip?” he asks you as you sit down on the other end of the couch, as far from him as possible.

“No, I am fine right now,” you reply, doing your best to lie smoothly and not slur your words.

“You look a little out of it.  Just a little rip, it will help you even yourself out.  We haven’t even gotten to the fun yet and I don’t want you passing out.”

You think back to the first night in Mitch’s apartment, recalling how it seemed to pass by quickly despite being torturous.  Maybe the drugs did help.

You glance at Mitch and find him eyeing you eagerly, an edge of sternness in his expression.

“C’mon, it will feel good,” Mitch assures you.

“Fine, just a little one.  I am not used to this,” you say, gesturing at the large glass bong.
[[Smoke the bong]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="Prepare yourself" tags="" position="13012,12596" size="100,100">When you open your eyes you find his face is right in front of yours.  Before you can panic or move away, Mitch grabs your face and lowers his lips onto yours.

“What the fuck!?” you rage and sputter, managing to push him off of you just enough to free yourself.

“Taylor you said you would spend the night with me.  You know what I want--what I think we both want.”  

You are about to flee the building, consequences be damned, when Mitch takes out a condom and sets it on the table.  Your breath catches in your throat.  He might as well have taken out a bullet, for the impact of the gesture nearly scares you half to death.

“It is a simple choice,” Mitch continues.  “Lots of people out there would be interested in those videos.  Either way I am getting a win.  You could too, if you relaxed a bit and tried to enjoy life for a change.  So Taylor, what is it going to be?  Are you going to let me fuck you or not?” he asks you point blank.

Your eyes fall on the condom, a queasy feeling seizing control of your stomach.

“I just want this to be over with,” you say sadly.

“Good choice, Taylor.  It will all be over soon and I bet it will feel really good for both of us,” he says to you as he begins to fondle your breasts and kiss, lick, and bite at the nape of your neck.

As Mitch grabs at you and explores your body, you attempt to mentally detach yourself from the moment, only to be drawn back in when Mitch begins gently rubbing you between your legs.

//Uh...oh my….this can’t be happening!//  You feel yourself responding to Mitch’s coaxing.  A mixture of alcohol, marijuana, and arousal have taken over your body.

[[Give in]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="Give in" tags="" position="13165,12645" size="100,100">You now find it more difficult to breath.  You’re being smothered with conflicting thoughts and sensations.  Mitch has gotten rougher in his advances but there is a small, growing aspect of yourself that admits it feels good.  A part of you wants it to stop, another silently urging him to continue.  //I am a guy you//, tell yourself.  //But why is my pussy tingling so much?  Men do not have pussies but I now have one.  Why did I come here?  Because I am a coward and a pussy, //you answer your own question.  Maybe it was fate to use your pussy for recompense for your childish naivety.

“Uhhhnnn!” you squeal as Mitch finally presses a finger against your stomach and slides between your skin and underwear.  Soon his huge hand has covered your vagina.  You feel the caress of his fingers as he begins to slowly rub into your moist, sensitive folds.  Soon you find that your crotch has become unbearably hot.

You look over at Mitch, a shocked expression no doubt dominating your face.  “What’s wrong?  I am just warming you up for the main event,” he informs you, before resuming his assault.

You try and think about other things, to focus on shapes in the stucco, to think of anything except what is currently happening to you, but you are unable to deny the pleasurable sensations given off by your new body.

“Ohhh,” you let another sound slip through your upper lips as Mitch penetrates your lower lips with a thick finger.

“You’re so fucking tight.  I can’t believe I have Taylor’s virgin pussy all to myself!”

You are unsure how to reply to that.  You close your eyes as Mitch continues to work on your pussy.  He rolls his fingers around your clit for a few moments before tracing your inner labia, going back and forth until you feel your legs moving involuntarily in time with his movements.

It isn’t long before you begin to feel a building pressure deep inside you.  The feeling keeps growing in intensity until soon it is the only thing you can think of.  You feel an orgasm rapidly approaching.

//No!  I can’t cum here, not like this, not with Mitch...Anyone but him, nooooo….//

“AAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!” your voice rings out as you climax.  Your pelvis and legs shiver and convulse for a moment and the next second you feel like you are wrapped in cotton candy, covered in soft, fluffy sweetness, awash with satisfaction and a pleasurable buzz.

[[Continue the night]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="Continue the night" tags="" position="13005,12753" size="100,100">Mitch chuckles and withdraws his hand from your panties.  He then holds up two fingers for you to inspect.  They are covered in transparent, glistening fluid.  //Is that from me?  Did I…?  Oh no....//

“Okay, I think you are ready now,” Mitch predicts with a cocky smile as he stands, looking down at you.  “Let’s have one last round and then we’ll go to my bedroom.”

He pulls out four shot glasses and fills them with a nearby bottle.  Mitch pushes two towards you and picks up one of his own.  “Cheers,” he says, in an effort to click glasses.  You ignore him, lost in the swirling brown ripples.  You know you should take it easy, and that your mental faculties are already compromised, but you pick up a glass anyway.  //Maybe it will help me forget this night.//

Mitch swallows his down in rapid succession, then looks at you with a sneer, urging you to drink yours as well.  You look at Mitch and find his stare to be mocking you, silently calling you a pussy, betting you can’t or won’t drink.

It is childish but you slam your drinks down, nearly gagging at the strong alcoholic aftertaste.

Mitch nods approvingly and then pulls out a tiny bag of pills from an end table.  He takes two out.

“Want one?” he asks you.  “They will make feel really good!”  Mitch then pops one of the pills in his mouth and swallows.

“No, I certain-ly don’t,” you answer.  The newest shots are starting to affect you.  You were never much of a drinker and now that you are a lot smaller you have become a super lightweight.  You are already hopelessly drunk and stoned, far more than you have ever been before in your life.  Adding to that just seems like monumental overkill.

“Your loss,” Mitch says, popping the other pill down his throat. 

Mitch then begins walking down the hall.  You stay seated, still trying to catch your breath and regain your bearings.  Your eyes eventually land on the doorway.  //This is my last opportunity to get out of here,// you think.  //The last moment before the act  I have been dreading.//  But you are already here.  You’re drunk.  You’ve already committed to this awful night and events have already progressed way too far for you to turn back down now without serious consequences.

[[Go to Mitch&#39;s room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Go to Mitch&#39;s room" tags="" position="13150,12794" size="100,100">You stand up and make several slow, wobbly steps forward, as if your feet were made of lead.

The door to Mitch’s bedroom is open.  When you finally reach the threshold you can see Mitch inside, seated on the bed.  His room is filthy but you ignore it, stepping over a heap of garbage to stand before Mitch in all your feminine glory.

Mitch studies you for a long time, as if savouring and memorizing the moment in his mind forever.  //I will always remember this too,// you think sadly.  //The worst moment of my life//.

When Mitch is done feasting on you with his eyes, he stands and embraces you, pulling you tight to him.  Your breasts are pressed hard against his thick, manly chest.  He hugs you for a while, hands tightly gripping your buttocks.  As much as you hate what is happening, the sensation of skin on skin feels good.

Eventually you try and take a step back as Mitch tries to kiss you again.  You manage to turn your head just enough to deflect it to your cheek.  Soon he is kissing your collarbone and moving lower.  His face lands between your breasts and he begins to motorboat you.

You just stand there, powerless to resist, every ounce of your self control needed to keep your composure.  Mitch begins to tease at one of your nipples with his lips and tongue as he roughly massages your other breast.  Soon, it is clear you are putty in his hands.  You are Mitch’s toy tonight.  //But only for tonight.//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/undy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Suddenly Mitch spins you around so your back is to the bed.  He pulls your top off in one fluid motion and gently pushes you onto the bed.  You are past the point of resistance and let yourself fall backyards.

[[Resign yourself to your fate]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Resign yourself to your fate" tags="" position="13007,12901" size="100,100">You lie on the bed, staring up at Mitch as he slowly undresses.  First he takes off his shirt, revealing a figure that took a lot of hard gym work to attain.  For a split second you are jealous of his body, of his muscles, his huge cock, and his commanding height.  His chest is broad and well muscled, his prominent six pack on display.  It sucks but you have to admit Mitch had you outclassed in the manliness department even before your transformation.  And now there could be no doubt.  What was about to happen now was something primal, something shared only between a man and a woman.

Mitch unbuckles his pants and slides down his boxers, now standing completely naked before you.  Your eyes fall on his penis, easily double the size of your missing manhood.  You cannot imagine such a thing even fitting inside you.  One of Mitch’s fingers barely fit, let alone that monstrous //thing.//

Using your mouth to pleasure him was humiliating enough but losing your virginity to Mitch Schnapps?  That was a whole new level of fucked up.  You know that this is something once done, you may never be able to recover from.  Your body would heal but your mind?  And what about your pride and reputation?  None of it mattered anymore.

Unable to wait any longer, Mitch falls on top of you.  He grabs your breasts through your bra and squeezes them hard.  Mitch then pulls your bra down and marvels at your chest.  “You have beautiful tits, Taylor.  Been awhile since I seen them in all their glory.”  

The reminder of the first night at the bar makes you queasy, more awful feelings are added to the ongoing maelstrom in your gut.

[[&quot;Uhhh...I don&#39;t feel very good...&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="Have sex with Mitch" tags="" position="13009,13052" size="100,100">You look down and see Mitch’s massive veiny cock poised to penetrate your virgin pussy.  //This is wrong.  This is so fucked up!// So many thoughts flood your mind.  //I can’t believe this is my last moment as a virgin.  How the hell did it come to this?//

“Let’s do it,” Mitch says, as he begins to slowly thrust forward, slowly pushing his cockhead into your folds, deep into your most intimate of places.

You freeze and tense up, eyes wide at the shocking and foreign sensation of penetration.  It was somewhat similar to the fingers, except much bigger in impact and size.

Mitch moans with joy as he plows into you, spreading and ripping you apart with his huge dick.  Soon he is halfway inside you and you can feel your inner walls tightly grasping him.

//No!  No!  Noooo!  It isn’t going to fit!// You mentally scream as Mitch’s girth spreads you apart as his huge penis disappears inside you.

“Unnnggggh…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/fpovinsert.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“This is exactly how I imagined this,” Mitch whispers in your ear.  “That expression on your face, this feeling of being inside you, everything is absolutely perfect.  This is the best day of my life,” he says as he forces his entire length inside you, filling you to your very limits that moments earlier you did not even know you had.  //The best day in Mitch’s life...the worst in mine.//  The whole scenario seemed like some horrible nightmare, cooked up by a demented mind.

Mitch continues to ransack your virgin pussy with his huge cock, plundering you deep to your very core.

After what feels like an eternity, Mitch’s breath becomes ragged and thrusts begin to rapidly accelerate, his manhood sliding in and out of you at a ferocious rate.

With a grunt, Mitch fills you with his semen and you gasp as you feel the warmth of his seed shoot forward and spill deep inside your center. 

“Uh… so deep… it almost feels like…”  //Wait...did he?  Yes, he just fucking came inside me!!//  
[[This can&#39;t be real!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="This can&#39;t be real!" tags="" position="13159,13101" size="100,100">“Where the fuck is the condom?” you ask him, staring down in horror as he withdraws his naked, glistening penis from you.  You watch in horror as his semen leaks out of you, tainted with a trace of blood.  “No, no, NO!” you howl in frustration.  //Why is this happening to me?// You wonder in terror as tears well in your eyes. Your vagina is throbbing while your mind shudders with frustrated rage.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchdripping.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh! I totally forgot…” Mitch answers with a shrug.  “Oh well ya got a taste of the real thing for your first time.”  He shoots you a drunken grin.  “Always better to have the real deal when trying something new,” he adds.

“I have to…”  //I have to what?//  “I have to go,” you tell him.

“What do you mean?  You can’t go yet!” he protests.  “It is only eight o&#39;clock.  I was under the impression I have you for the rest of the night.”

You wipe the tears from your eyes.  “But you already...//we// already…”

“That was just a warm up!  I have been saving up all week for this,” he says the words confidently, gesturing at his cock that has somehow become completely hard again.

“W-what?” you stammer, shocked at his stamina.  //He just came and he is already rock hard again.//  You’re not sure how that makes you feel.  There was no way you could have recovered so quickly even on your horniest days as a teenage boy.  //Is he that turned on by me?// 

Mitch slides off the bed and begins rummaging around.  He pulls out a fucking BOX of condoms.

You stare in shock at the box.  //Forty eight extra large “magnum” style condoms,// you read the label in disbelief.

“Don’t worry we won’t use the //whole// box tonight,” he jokes when he sees your expression.  “I do aim to get through as many as I can though.  Been popping these all day to help,” he adds, holding up a small viagra bottle before popping a pill into his mouth.
[[You hate Mitch so much right now]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Reflect on what just transpired" tags="" position="13010,13345" size="100,100">Your mind and sense of self is in shambles.  Mitch has just given you the most intense and mind blowing orgasms of your life.  You don’t know how you will ever recover from it.  //Mitch has ruined me,// you think as you head home with a very unsteady almost bow legged walk, your entire body aching from your first night of hard fucking.  A part of you knows that you will never be the same again.

A few days go by.  Your brain and body recover somewhat although a dull soreness pervades your nether region long after your other pains fade.  You find yourself feeling tired and depressed, lethargically going throughout your daily motions.  Your life goes on and you do things where your new gender has no impact.  You binge watch some Netflix but don&#39;t really get any enjoyment from the shows.  Even though your problems are ostensibly solved, you feel hollow.

You continue to go about your day to day tasks mindlessly.  One day while fruitlessly browsing the web for a cure, you feel a sudden desire to get stoned.  //It would be nice to just relax for a bit,// you tell yourself, even though that is basically what you have been doing for the past two weeks.

You send a few messages to try and find a hookup but no one gets back to you except Jimmy who is dry.  You only knew of one other, completely unacceptable option.  //Not like I am going to call Mitch!//  You dismiss that idea before it is even fully formed.
[[Try and sleep...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Think about your dream" tags="" position="13019,13500" size="100,100">“What kind of dream was I having?” you wonder.   “I guess girls can have wet dreams too….wait...what was I---?”  Your blood runs cold as a fragment of your dream floats to the surface of your memory.  //Mitch.  Oh my god.//

You had tried to not think about what had happened to you that night but it was impossible.  Even if you consciously banished the thoughts from your waking mind, your dreams were another matter entirely.  The experience had deeply affected you as a person.

You only had one excessively brief sexual experience as a man.  Enough to claim you had lost your virginity, but not enough to claim proficiency.  What had happened to you the past two weeks had now given you far more sexual experience than you would have liked.  Yet it was impossible to deny that you had sex with a man and had orgasmed more times than you could count.  You now had far more sex as a woman than you had as a man.  You had even lost your virginity a second time… to Mitch.  Your pathetically quick ejaculation paled in comparison to the constantly cycling pleasurable renewal of a woman’s orgasm.

It was a bit hard to judge, but you are quite confident that women have men beat in the sex arena.  Not only was it easier to get as an attractive woman but the sensations were beyond comparison.

“Women fantasize about men all the time!” you try and rationalize.  You are in the body of a woman now.  It isn’t your fault.  It is //Mitch’s// fault.  //That stupid, insufferable, fucking asshole....//

//It isn’t my fault he has that thick, muscled chest, that six pack you could rock climb on, and that huge, untiring cock… FUCKING HELL!  Seriously, what is wrong with me?//  You shake your head to dispel the bizarre thoughts that come unbidden to your mind.

You feel so horribly conflicted.  “If I am seriously fantasizing about Mitch it might be time to actually kill myself.”  You put your head in your hands.  “C’mon Taylor.  It is just //this// body, reacting to //his// body.  Nothing more to it.  The guy is repulsive,” you tell yourself, despite the growing dampness between your legs.

[[Continue on]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Enter the alley" tags="" position="13162,13692" size="100,100">You stop when see &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Mitch&quot; &quot;Mitch desc&quot;&gt;&gt; leaning against the wall.  It is the first time you have seen him since...that night.

Jerry seemed to sense the weird vibe.  “You two know each other, right?”

“Yeah, Taylor and I go way back,” says Mitch.  He eyes you from head to toe and gives you a leering grin.

“Cool.”  Jerry sparks up a doobie and then passes it to you.  You are split with indecision.  You kind of want to kick Mitch in the balls.  You know it would be best to just leave.  Yet, the alluring smoke calls you forward.  You decide that you and Mitch have nothing to say to each other and that you’re just going to enjoy a free toke and leave.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/joint.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The joint gets passed around a few times and soon you are completely baked.  You look over at Mitch and find him staring at you nearly constantly, his gaze focused upon your modest chest.  When the joint is finished you feel uncomfortable and overly self conscious.

“I am going to go, thanks for the toke.  I appreciate it,” you say to Jerry.  You turn to leave and find Mitch standing next to your way out.  

You walk by him without a word, trying not to even look at him.

For just an instant, you are side by side.  “I have been thinking about you every night.  Still got a few condoms left if you’re interested,” Mitch whispers to you as you pass.

[[Go home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Go home" tags="" position="13018,13788" size="100,100">Mitch’s taunt sticks with you during the walk home.  You try to banish Mitch from your mind, but find that he is taking up more and more of your thoughts regardless of your preference.  You hate him, that’s undeniably true.  But there is also some disturbed part of you that also finds him attractive. 

The next day you wake up you see that you have a message.  A picture attachment from Mitch.  “Not again!” you say aloud, immediately fearing more blackmail.  After a moment of hesitation, you tap the image.  It is a high resolution picture of Mitch’s junk.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dpic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“EW!” you yelp as you throw the phone down with disgust.

[[Continue your day]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="Continue your day" tags="" position="13164,13846" size="100,100">You clean the house and do laundry, catching up on many of the chores you have been neglecting lately.  After eating a snack you begin to feel a bit frisky.  You start browsing the internet, and eventually the topics turn naughty.  You feel yourself warming up, and so finally settle on some of your favourite blowjob pictures.  You begin to rub yourself and fantasize.  You feel hot and your pleasure keeps steadily increasing until it is all you can think about.  You stare at the picture in front of you, your eyes moving from the girl to the cock.  The girl has an absolutely euphoric expression on her face as she devours the huge dick in front of her.  //Oh my this is so hot.//  You find a video of the same model and click play.  You watch the pornstar with fascination, you feel a bit uncomfortable but completely turned on.  The girl’s blissful expression and the way her tongue and lips massage her partner’s cock leaves your own panties a mess, you can clearly see the engorged rose bud of your clit.  Your hand begins to move faster and faster as you mentally slip into the video.  //It feels so good to have my dick sucked.//  Suddenly your mental perspective shifts and you imagine yourself sucking the cock in the picture.  For a moment you are that girl on her knees and you longingly stick your tongue out at the screen.  You cum hard a moment later.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempovmasturbate.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Unlike when you were a man, instead of an orgasm ending your fap session, as a girl an O kick-started it.  Soon you are masturbating like crazy.  You are hot and bothered, searching for the perfect picture or video to finish to.  You keep looking and soon become frustrated.  After your first few orgasms, you try to move away from any porn involving a penis. Yet nothing you see quite fits the bill.
[[Keep masturbating]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="See if you can find something to do" tags="" position="13158,13991" size="100,100">You text &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Jimmy&quot; &quot;Jimmy desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, the local party hound, and ask him if anything is happening.”

He texts you an address with the description “house party.”

//Perfect,// you think.

You slip into a sexy black dress belonging to your sister and head to the party.

You let loose.  You get pretty drunk and find yourself having a blast.

You spot Jimmy talking with a crowd of girls.  One is &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Rhea&quot; &quot;Rhea desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, a blonde bombshell and self professed “sex goddess”.  You do not recognize the others.  Jimmy is giving handing out small tablets.  Drunk and curious you slink over and ask Jimmy what he has.

“Magic,” he replies, handing you a tiny pink tablet.  “It&#39;s concentrated happiness; it&#39;s chemical bliss,” explains the lanky man.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pinkpill.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
Normally you would have refused without a second thought, but now you are feeling adventurous.  You feel you were more than overdue some happiness even if it is artificial.  Your life this semester has been nothing but a long slog.  You pop the pink tablet into your mouth without another thought.

[[Mingle]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="Enjoy the party" tags="" position="13160,14147" size="100,100">The words disappear like fog boiled off by the light of day.  You keep dancing, eager to let the pink guide your night.  The experience feels more liberating that you could have possibly imagined.

“Hey Taylor,” a low voice greets you.  You turn and face Mitch and find that your first instinct to hate him seems to be bypassed.  He eyes you over and breaks into his usual, cocky grin.  “Wow your pupils are huge….what are you on tonight, babe?”

“The pink magic of love,” you reply, sure it is the right answer.

Mitch grins.  He reaches forward and presses two fingers under your chin, feeling for your pulse.  You gasp at his touch.  Yet you don’t protest, you let him touch you and even manage a weak smile.  “Holy fuck,” he laughs at the apparent speed of your racing heart.  He runs his hands over your thighs and his touch makes you gasp and shiver.  Every bit of your skin feels like it has become an erogenous zone, even the barest touch sending lightning bolts of pleasure shooting through your body.
[[Talk to Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="Go inside" tags="" position="13164,14293" size="100,100">“I never would have imagined I would be able to get you back here so soon,” Mitch says to you when you are alone together in his room.

You couldn’t have imagined it either.

Mitch is staring at your tits.  “That dress looks amazing on you,” he says after a moment of ogling.

“Thanks,” you awkwardly reply.

“Now let’s get it off you!” Mitch yells as he advances on you.  Soon you are stripped naked and thrown onto the bed.

You yelp in surprise as you are tossed onto the covers.

“How are you feeling?” Mitch asks you.

You had momentarily lost yourself in the soft feeling of your skin on the cool sheets.  “I feel really good...and warm,” you answer, not quite remembering who are speaking to.  Your body is begging to be touched, you keep rubbing your hands all over yourself.  The euphoric waves are still pulsing through your body.  You almost feel like you are floating upon a magic cloud.

The mattress creaks as someone lies down beside you. You turn to face the intruder and see Mitch naked and up close.  “Mitch?  Why are you here?” you ask him, suddenly confused.  Your mind seems so foggy, you can’t quite remember.  It seems so disconcerting, like a disturbing dream.

“Is this a dream?” you ask him.

“Of course it is Taylor.  No consequences.  No strings attached.  Just a dream you will forget in the morning.  Now it is time to have some fun!”

“Oh, that’s good,” you say as a wave of euphoria washes over you.  The room continues to spin around.  //There is no reason to be ashamed in a dream.  In fact, I might as well enjoy myself, // a soft voice whispers from somewhere within your mind.

[[Enjoy the &quot;dream&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name="Enjoy the &quot;dream&quot;" tags="" position="13020,14394" size="100,100">Mitch suddenly kisses you and the sensation is so pleasurable you finally let him after a brief struggle.

He pushes you on your back and climbs on top of you, using his strong hands to firmly push open your legs.

“If a kiss, or a mere touch feels that good...I bet you are wondering what it would feel like to have sex right now!”

“Uhh….” the thought had just crossed your mind.

“I want your permission, Taylor.  Say, “you have my permission to do anything you want, Mitch” and I will make you cum so hard you won’t be able to walk in the morning.”

You find your own breath is now coming too fast.  Your heart is racing.  The tingling throughout your body, radiating from your centre is making you squirm underneath Mitch’s steady figure.

Soon you cannot take it anymore.  “Do whatever you want!” you tell him.  //It is only a dream.  Please let this only be a dream...//
[[Give in to your urges]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="Keep &quot;dreaming&quot;" tags="" position="13017,14687" size="100,100">Eventually you untangle yourselves.  Just when you think the night is finally winding down, Mitch begins to tease you again.  It isn’t long before he has re-stoked the fires burning within you.

“Why are you doing this?” you ask him, as Mitch coaxes a moan from you as he teases your nipples.

“Because it’s a dream.  You want this, remember?” he says while urging open your legs.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchfpov.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I uh….uh….” you cannot reply as Mitch begins to rub you faster and faster, suddenly penetrating you with his middle and ring fingers.  “Oh!”  He begins to speed up, his hand turning into a human vibrator.  Soon you can’t take it anymore and shudder, coaxed into yet another incredible release.

[[This is the best dream ever!]]

&quot;I am not gay,&quot; Mitch answers your implied question.
&quot;Right, neither am I.  A bunch of super fucked up shit has happened to me.  Maybe you&#39;re not that bad of a guy, who the fuck knows?  But I don&#39;t have time to find out.  I have to figure out how the hell I can return to normal.  Unless you can help me with that man, please just give me some space.  I have //serious fucking issues.//  Going on a play date with you is not high priority - if this a serious request.  Please, if you do actually have some weird man-crush on me or whatever, then please do me the kindness of not pressuring me right after my entire fucking life has been turned upside down.  Be a nice guy and leave me the fuck alone.&quot;
	Mitch nodes.  &#39;So...give you some time and space?&quot;
	&quot;Yes!  Exactly!  Time and space.  //A lot of time and space.//&quot;  //Like a bad sci-fi movie!//
	&quot;How much...time?&quot;
	&quot;I dunno!  How about a m---three months!&quot;  //That should be more than enough time for me to figure all this shit out.//  You have always been fond of optimistic estimates.
	&quot;Three months?&quot; Mitch balks.
	&quot;Yeah, come back in three months if you don&#39;t want me to think you are a huge creeper!&quot;
	&quot;I---uhh...okay…&quot;  You are pretty stunned when Mitch just gives up and walks away.  //I can&#39;t believe that worked...//
	[[Go inside your house]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Head back home" tags="" position="3953,5159" size="100,100">//Fucking Mitch!  I can’t believe that scumbag.//  You rub your battered fists as a litany of curses storms through your mind.  A few minutes later, you are back home and washing cool water over your knuckles when you hear a voice.

“Taaaaylor!  You home?” the voice shouts.  //Fuck!  It’s Julie….  What the hell I am supposed to say to her?//

A second later you are trapped when Julie stands in the doorway.  
“Um...Hi?  How did you get in here?  Who are you?” Julie looks confused.

//Fuck...I guess this was bound to happen anyway.//

“Um.  Julie, this is a bit hard to explain…”

[[You decide to tell Julie the truth]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="Wake up from your &quot;dream&quot;" tags="" position="13155,14890" size="100,100">When you wake up Mitch is still on top of you and your head is throbbing.  All illusions of last night being a dream vanish immediately. // Oh fuck what have I done?  How fucking stupid am I?  Fuck, fuck, fuck! // Getting super drunk.  Mysterious pink tablets.  Going home with Mitch.

You should write a textbook on how to make bad decisions.

You manage to shove Mitch off of you and walk unsteadily to the bathroom.  You sit on the toilet, catching a glimpse of your messed up hair and makeup.  You feel dizzy and completely numb.  The world last night was in full color, today everything was in drab black and white.

You suddenly become conscious of that fact that all the crusty white stuff covering your body is comprised of Mitch’s semen.

With a feeling of horror your hand shoots to your pussy, its lips puckered and sore.  You let a finger probe your entrance and then pull it up for inspection.  It smells awful, covered with the unmistakable texture and odor of semen.  You shift position to get a better look at yourself and wince as your pussy begins to ache.  

“How many times did he cum inside me last night?” you wonder. You are unsure how your reproductive system is functioning.  You don’t even know if it is possible for you to get pregnant, but the last thing you would want would be to have to bear Mitch’s fucking child.  You almost vomit at the thought.

You creep back into Mitch’s room and gather your clothes as silently as possible.  You find everything except your panties, dress quietly, and then leave the apartment complex.

When you get home the first thing you do is shower and try and wash the memories of the previous night away.

The next day you don’t feel well and decide to avoid your friends for a bit.  Evan and Drew would realize something is wrong.  You decide to skip class and hang out at home.

Just around the time morning class would be starting you hear a knock at your door.

[[Answer the door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="Answer the door" tags="" position="13012,14994" size="100,100">You open it and see the last person you want to at the moment.  &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Mitch&quot; &quot;Mitch desc&quot;&gt;&gt; is standing on your doorstep grinning at you.

“Can I come in?” he asks you.

“No, go away please.”

“Awe, come on Taylor.  Don’t be that way.  I just came back to return your panties.”  He says the the last three words loud enough to draw some strange looks from a couple walking nearby.

“Fuck!  Be quiet.”

“I just want to talk.”

“Fine.”  You let him inside.

“Nice place,” he says as he looks around.

“Uh huh, now what do you want?  You aren’t going to be able to blackmail me with those panties.”

“Yeah I know.  I just wanted to say I had a blast last night.  I was wondering if you wanted to make it a regular thing.”

“Uh, fuck no,” you answer immediately.  Mitch laughs.  

“I knew you would say that!”  He takes your panties and a small baggie out of his pocket. “Well here are some gifts for you anyway. Well  see ya around Taylor.  Let me know if you ever need anything or get a craving that needs satisfying.”

With that he thankfully leaves you alone.  

A week goes by and you finally have a moment when you notice the baggie Mitch left you.  You had considered throwing it out until you realized it contained the same beloved pink tablets you had enjoyed before.  Despite your best efforts, you are unable to muster the willpower to flush them down the toilet.

[[Try to resist]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="Try to resist" tags="" position="13159,15054" size="100,100">The next day all you can think about is the pink tablet and your desire to try it again.

Eventually the allure becomes too great.  You decide to try one, while staying safely at home this time.  That way getting into mischief should be impossible.  You consume a tablet and soon find yourself in a chemically induced paradise.

You bask in the euphoric sensations until you feel completely at peace.  Then, suddenly, an image of Mitch appears in your mind’s eye.  Buff and manly he stands before you in all his glory, his fully engorged cock is proof of his excitement.  Your hand moves to your pussy and you begin to play with yourself, masturbating the entire night away, chasing the spectre of some horrible perversion that had once left you satisfied.

The next night you consume another tablet and enjoy yourself in much the same manner.  

The day after your second test, the thought of taking a break occurs to you but the call of pleasure is too much to ignore.  You had a lot of fun at home but you notice the pleasure had lessened considerably from your first time trying it.

You take a break for a few days before taking another tablet.  It rejuvenated the experience.  It was awesome again, almost as good as you remember it being the first time.

Over the next two weeks you consume almost a tablet a day.  Your midterms come and go and you mostly bomb them but you don’t particularly care.

You are obviously building up a tolerance to the tablets but find life dull without them.  One day you decide to take two.  Your glorious experience returns.  You have an experience that is impossible to explain or describe.  You become one with the universe, a hippy cliche.

You do two every time after that until one horrible day you find your supply is now empty.

You go a day without and it is torture compared to your previous bliss.  You reach out to all your sketchiest friends, Jimmy first among them, but no one has a supply.  Jerry gave you your only good lead, but you know contacting Mitch again would lead down a rabbit hole of self destruction.

Another day passes and you start to rationalize approaching Mitch.  You kick the thought away but it stubbornly returns again and again.  After a week, you decide that you have had enough of painful, sober waiting.

[[Contact Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="Contact Mitch" tags="" position="13011,15140" size="100,100">“Taylor my dear.” Mitch grins as he opens the door to let you inside.  “I had a feeling I would see you again one day.  So what’s up?  Blowjob for old time’s sake?” he jokes.

“No, I am here for business.  Do you have anymore of those pink wonders?”

“Hmm.  Those are really hard to get at the moment.  I have other stuff.”

“I would really prefer the pink ones,” you reply.

“You know what?  For you Taylor, I will scour the city until you are satisfied.  You look beautiful as ever, but a bit frayed.  I got something that might pep you up, no charge.”

He holds up a tiny spoon of what you think is cocaine.  You have only ever seen it in the movies.

“Uh, no thanks,” you say, raising your hands to ward off the drugs.

“Well that isn’t very polite.  I am doing you a favour, the least you can do is accept my hospitality and maybe do me one in return.  Just try a teensy little bit and see if you like it.”

You can already feel your self control crumbling.  You subconsciously came here for the pursuit of something that would make you feel better.  “Fine,” you say, inhaling the powder with a snort.  You immediately feel //really// good.  You feel incredibly focused, like your happiness switch has been turned from off to on.

You look around Mitch’s dirty apartment, noticing more details than ever before.  You have never felt so awake, confident, and aware of your surroundings.

Your eyes snap to Mitch as he begins to take off his pants.  “What are you doing?” you ask him.

“I’ll get you your pills, sweetie, no charge.  But you are going to blow me in return.  I want you to make me cum and swallow every drop like the slut you are, or else no pink pills.  //Ever.//”

[[Respond to Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="Respond to Mitch" tags="" position="13161,15186" size="100,100">You are taken aback by the ultimatum.  You had intended to pay cash.  You had brought two hundred dollars, yet now the type of transaction had changed and Mitch’s hard cock was again in front of you.

You open your mouth to plead with him but realize it is put to better use elsewhere.  

You kneel before Mitch.  You begin by kissing the head of his penis, rolling your tongue over it repeatedly until you taste nothing but the sourness and sweaty tang of Mitch’s dirty cock.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockkiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ohhh yeah! Thatta girl!&quot;

[[Service Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="Walk home" tags="" position="13161,15346" size="100,100">As you walk home you suddenly notice Evan.  He spots you a second later and runs up to you.  

“Taylor, you ghost!  Haven’t seen you around much, are you okay?  How ya been?”

“I am fine,” you reply absently.

“Doesn’t really look like it.  You’ve been skipping a lot of class lately too,” he observes.  “And I was talking to Jimmy the other day and he said you left a party with //Mitch!//  I told him he needs to get glasses.  As if you would ever go home with….”  His voice suddenly cuts off, your lack of prompt denial and expression must have given you away.  

“You went with him?  Like back to his place?  Taylor?  What-the-fuck?”

You bite your lip but nod sadly after a moment.  You don’t mention the drugs or the fact you are just returning from the same place, and can still faintly taste Mitch’s semen lingering on your tongue.

Evan looks like you just informed him all dogs are capable of speech.  “Are you and Mitch….a //thing?//  Like dating?” he asks, still confused and looking for confirmation of your shocking relationship.

“No, no, of course not.”

“Did he take advantage of you?” Evan asks you and you almost laugh.  //Understatement of the year.//

“A bit.  It doesn’t matter anymore.  I am fine,” you assure him.

“Well if that creep touches you let me know and I will “talk” with him.”  Evan makes a fist.  That is a touching offer but you are quite sure Mitch would beat the shit out of Evan if it ever came to that.  “Well I got to head to class-you should try it some time.  If you need anything or want to hang out, text me.  See ya Taylor,” Evan says as he departs with a wave.

[[Proceed home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="Proceed home" tags="" position="13013,15451" size="100,100">You wander home and find yourself watching TV.  You frequently stare into space, feeling lethargic and dazed.  All the shows seem boring.  You find yourself thinking about your meeting with Mitch earlier.  How you dropped down on your knees and eagerly serviced him.  You feel worthless and wretched.  How is it you could have possibly fell so far, so fast?  You silently wish you had something to distract you from your self hating thoughts.

You make a snack and find that even the food tastes uninteresting and bland.  You go and have a long nap until you hear the beep of a text message.  You pick up your phone and look at the message.

It reads: “I got the pink.  Will trade the pink for pink ;) -M”

“What?  He can’t be serious.”  //Of course he is serious, fucking Mitch.//

The prospect of fucking Mitch for drugs makes you feel even sicker.  The worst part is you know how bad you want them and watching yourself rationalize the action is an exercise in mental gymnastics.  What would your parents think of you now?

“It is just a quick, in and out, and I will save lots of money,” you tell yourself.  “The orgasms are just a bonus.”

It has been days since your last tablet.  You text Mitch, “BRT.”

Soon you are in a familiar situation, standing awkwardly in Mitch’s apartment with sexual tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.

[[Greet Mitch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="90" name="Greet Mitch" tags="" position="13155,15504" size="100,100">“Found the good stuff,” he says with a smile, tossing you a tiny bottle that rattles as you catch it. // Fuck, //you think, realizing that there is only about a dozen tablets inside.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pinkpill.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
//Better than nothing,// you figure.  Mitch interrupts you with a polite cough.  “Ahem.”

You turn towards him and he moves uncomfortably close to you.  He opens up the baggie in your hand and takes out two tablets.  He pops one in his mouth and holds the other for you.  “Say “ahhh,” he jokes.  You open your mouth and Mitch sets the tablet on your tongue.

You wanted to avoid trying them here but it is too late now.  The silver lining is at least you will probably enjoy yourself.

[[Swallow the pill]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="Respond to the voice" tags="" position="4245,5842" size="200,200">“Taaaaaaaylor!  You home?” Julie’s voice rings throughout your house.

“In here!” you call back but instantly regret doing so as your new soprano voice echoes down the hall.   You hear a thumping noise and the sound of footsteps.  The next moment your sister Julie enters your room, at first looking annoyed and then incredibly confused as her eyes focus on you and the otherwise empty room.

“Who are you!?  Where is my brother?”

“I// am //your brother,” you respond.

“You do look kind of familiar,”she admits after about thirty seconds of eyeing you.  “Except for the part about your gender, my brother is… well you know, he is my// brother,// he’s a //guy//…You are obviously not.”  Before you can respond she plows on, “So are you Taylor’s new girlfriend?  He is such a creep, he picks a girl that looks exactly like me!  How fucked is that?”

Julie&#39;s attitude annoys you.  You decide to:

[[Correct her]]

“Huh?” Julie raises an eyebrow.

“I am your brother.”

“Haha, sure you are!  Is he hiding in the closet or something?”

“Our parents are Margaret and Ted...uh I was born at the university hospital Jan 4th 1995, we used to go camping at Gapeto Lake every summer and you and I would always sneak off and we used to throw things at the outhouse whenever anyone went outside.  We were real //shit disturbers.//  You also got a big mole on your b--”

“OKAY!  //Enough.//  I somewhat believe you.  What the hell happened?”

“Fuck if I know.”

“Taylor… that isn’t a very good answer.”

“I am aware of that!” you snap.  &quot;My life is fucked!&quot;

“Well what are you going to do?”

“I don’t know.”

Julie peers around the room.  “Are you sure Taylor isn’t hiding in the closet?”

“Fucking hell!  I told you, I am right here!  Please just listen to me for fuck&#39;s sake!”

“I meant metaphorically...mostly at least.  It is still a bit hard to believe...but I would know my brother’s potty mouth anywhere and you are...//definitely// Taylor Roux.  Plus now that I look at you, you’re wearing //my// shirt and that stupid necklace you always do.”

“Thank you!”

“So you //obviously// need my help.”

“What do you mean?  You’re not a scientist.”

“No, I am your //sister,// and I am exactly what you need right now.&quot;

[[Let your sister &quot;help&quot; you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="93" name="Follow along" tags="" position="6593,7302" size="100,100">You briefly consider correcting her but decide against it. // It would be fun to tease her for a change.//  “I guess he just has good taste?” you suggest instead.

Your sister laughs.  “I guess that is one way to look at it.  You are pretty damn hot if I do say so--hah I feel I am complimenting myself abit by extension,” your sister says with a giggle.  Her expression then hardens and her eyes narrow.  “We do look a lot alike though...we would definitely be mistaken for sisters if we went out.  Might be fun… Oh!  We could double date!”

“Uh…”

“So, how did you and Taylor meet?”

[[Make up some bullshit]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="94" name="Make up some bullshit" tags="" position="6730,7402" size="100,100">“We met online,&quot; you answer.  &quot;Taylor is a fucking great guy.   Really smart, good looking too--and he’s a pro in the sack!” you boast.

“Really?”  Your sister seems quite surprised at your words.  The confused look on her face is so comical you nearly laugh out loud.  “So, you two have already done it, eh?”

“Yep, and he was //fucking fantastic.//”

“Funny, I haven’t heard about you.  And you’re already banging my brother and hanging around our place like you own it.”

“Yep!  So what?”

“You must be a huge fucking slut then.”

“Hey, fuck you!  That’s not a very nice thing to say.”

“I didn’t mean it in a bad way,” Julie clarifies.  Just as you are about to yell at her, she says, “Don’t worry, I am a big slut too.”  Her candid admission stuns you.  “So… what’s your name?” Julie asks you next.

//What is my name?//  Such an obvious question leaves you floundering.

“I am ...T---------Tammy,” you reply.

“You don’t seem so sure,” Julie observes, raising an eyebrow.

“I am super sure!  I am Tammy alright, 100%!”

“I’m--”

“Julie, I know...uh- Taylor told me.”

“I see.  Well...where is my loser brother then?”

//Fuck.//  “Uh, he is...out with some fat nerdy guy I think.”

Your sister sighs and shakes her head in disbelief.  “Yep, that sounds like Taylor all right.  Has a huge babe, a total sex kitten at home but spends his time playing fucking video games.  What do you see in that loser?” she asks you bluntly.

“Like I said...he’s….pretty charming and uh….”

“Trust me, you can do better.  Taylor’s a good kid and all but he isn’t quite in the same league as...well,// us//.”  Julie shoots you a coy smile.  “Taylor’s loss and my gain.” 

You don’t question your sister, merely content to stand idle nearby.  You’ve got yourself into this weird circumstance, now how the fuck do you get out?

“So, two bored sluts alone in a room...” your sister says, as if starting the beginning of a common joke.

[[Look back at Julie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="Search for information on your condition" tags="" position="3143,4842" size="100,100">You fruitlessly search the internet until your eyes feel too heavy to continue.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Focus on the game" tags="" position="2943,3799" size="100,100">Disgusted and disturbed by his reaction, you look away and try and focus on the TV screen.  Even with your head turned, you feel Drew’s gaze drawn to your body.  His unabashed, almost autistic, creepy stare begins to study every inch of your figure.

You turn to your friend, catching him staring directly at you, with a dumb, open mouthed stare.  “What?” you demand.

“I-I I am sorry, I just have never been alone before with such a beautiful girl,” he answers, sounding so serious and earnest that you almost want to slap him.

“I am NOT a girl, you idiot!” you counter.

“I know that… but my body doesn’t.”

“You’re such an idiot sometimes,” you chide him with a deep sigh.  You grab a chip and throw it up into the air in an attempt to toss it into your mouth.  The chip bounces off your face and sails under a nearby end table.  

Drew laughs.  “Graceful!” he comments as you walk over to retrieve the chip, bending over and half crawling under the table to reach it.  As soon as it is in hand, you realize that your compromising position has accidently afforded Drew a great view of your ass.  //Fuck!// You think as you awkwardly shimmy backwards and rise to your feet.  When you look at Drew his face his flushed and he doesn’t quite look you in the eye.

“Anyway that is enough kicking your ass today, Drew.  I need to do some “homework” and see if I can find any clues about….whatever the hell happened to me.  I am not super excited to become a lab rat.  Let me know if you have any ideas.  I will  see ya tomorrow,” you say as you rise to leave.  

“See you tomorrow Taylor!” Drew calls to you as you exit his house.  You only make it a few steps outside before you realize you forgot your bag.

[[Retrieve your belongings]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="98" name="Retrieve your belongings" tags="" position="2986,4594" size="100,100">You sigh and dash back up the steps to Drew’s house.  You knock and wait 15 seconds but there is no reply. // I just have to get my bag…//  It was only in the living room, it would just take a second.  You open the door, which is thankfully unlocked, and head to the living room.

As you near the main floor bathroom you hear a strange sound.  “Huh?  What is that noise?”  It sounded a lot like...moaning.  //Ew!//

Just as you tiptoe by the bathroom, you hear Drew inside.

“Uhhhhhhhhhhhohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Taaaaaaaaaaaylllor!!   Uhhhhhhhhhhhh…..” Drew calls out in a moment of passion.  You feel a sensation of revulsion as you inadvertently visualize the scene inside the bathroom.  “Uhhh….  Uhhh….” You can hear drew panting inside.  “Oh...my….god....~Taaaylor.”

//Wow!  That was the most awkward and fucked up thing ever//, you think as you snatch your bag and ghost out of the house.  You hear Drew exit the bathroom just as you slip outside.

The walk home was filled with conflicting thoughts about Drew and the reactions you seem to evoke from people now that you are a girl.

You follow your sister to the bathroom.  “You look ratty and boyish,” she appraises you under the bright lights.

“Uh huh...maybe because I am a fucking boy?”  

Your sister gives you a disparaging look.  She pulls down a folding chair and sets it in front of the mirror, before pushing you down on it.  Julie starts to roughly brush your hair.

“I can’t believe how long your hair got!  By the way, did you steal underwear from me too?” she asks you, as she works out a tangle.

“Of course not.”

“Well you’re going to need a bra or a chiropractor: pick one.  We Roux ladies are fairly well endowed. At least compared to the men.”  //I noticed...//

“Ughhh!  Leave me alone!”  The apparent fact your family is known for small dicks and big breasts makes you cringe.

Suddenly you feel your sister’s hands on the crotch of your jeans.

“What the fuck!?  Julie!?”

“Nope, those boyshorts are gone,” your sister orders as she tugs at your pants.

“I will wear what I want,” you evenly reply.  Your sister’s domineering nature is beginning to get on your nerves.

“Not if you want to be comfortable and sexy.”

“I don’t care about being sexy!”

“Didn’t you care about your appearance before?  [[What were all those lame workout attempts for then?”]]

The next morning you arrive early for class.

Your arrival triggers Drew and Evan to come from their separate corners and meet you in the middle of the atrium.

“Hi, Taylor,” Drew greets you.  He looks a tad nervous, well above his usual level of nervousness at least.

“Still a girl, eh?” Evan says to you as he saunters up to you and Drew.

“Obviously.”

“That sucks,” Evan replies.  He doesn’t sound disappointed in the least. 

Neither of your friends seem too bothered by your transformation and that fact actually pisses you off a little bit. You are certain that if one of your friends had been the victim of a similar transformation, you would not remain composed. 

You chat for a few minutes until class begins.

Mr. Deter begins a very boring lecture and you soon find yourself zoning out.  Eventually class is over and your friends join you by the doorway.

“I need to find a way to go back to the way I was before,” you re-explain your intentions to your friends.

//Ugh, what the heck am I going to do now?//  At least after class you have some free time.

You really need to search for more information on your predicament.  Drew and Evan are eyeing each other warily, it doesn’t seem like they have much interest in working together.  Still, you might be able to convince them.

You decide to...

[[Ask Evan for help]]
[[Ask Drew for help]]
[[Ask your friends to work together]]
[[Search by yourself]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Ask Evan for help" tags="" position="2306,8396" size="100,100">“Hey Ev, can you maybe take a bit of time out of your super busy schedule and help me?” you ask Evan.

He seems a bit surprised at your request.  “Sure, of course!  Always willing to help a lady in distress,” he readily responds.

“That is NOT helping, you dick!”

“Okay, I am sorry.  I will help you //and// I will try and behave myself.”

“Okay, but no more weird shit.”

“You might as well tell me not to breathe,” he replies with a laugh.

“I guess I will see what I can find out by myself.  I will do my best, Taylor,” Drew pledges before waddling off.

You and Evan eventually head to the library and start searching the databases.  You find a few very technical papers that go way over your head but end up finding nothing that would explain what happened to you.

//This is obviously something new...I guess even recent journals wouldn’t have anything.//

Eventually your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have been at it for hours.

“Ahhh, I am starving.”

“Me too,” Evan agrees.  “Want to go to the cafeteria?”

“Yeah, we could--”

“Oh!” Evan cuts you off with excitement as an idea apparently pops into his head.  “What about that pizzeria on the corner near campus?  They have a special today, large pizza half off if you dine in.”

“That does sound good,” you admit.  “And I guess I could treat you since you are helping me out.&quot;

“Great!  Let’s go!”

[[Go to the pizzeria with Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="Ask Drew for help" tags="" position="5286,8403" size="100,100">You decide to ask Drew for help.  He is a super smart guy and well informed, so you figure he could definitely help you if he put his big brain to work for you.

As you accept Drew’s offer, Evan looks a bit miffed and walks off with an irritated half-wave.

Finding your unintended sashay to be humorous juxtaposition to Drew’s large, plodding frame, you walk along beside you friend, arriving at Drew’s place without incident.  

Faced with the choice of work or play, you always choose play.  Without much thought, you get right into dueling it out with Drew in a series of fighting games.

Despite the fall season, it is sweltering outside.  It is late in the afternoon and since Drew doesn’t have AC, the house is already heating up.  You throw off your sweater and unbutton the top of your shirt to prevent suffocation.  Drew’s mouth falls open as you take your seat next to him.

You look at him and raise an eyebrow, then glance down at yourself and the ample cleavage you are displaying and laugh.

“Don’t get distracted!” you advise Drew with an facsimile of a giggle as you dropkick Drew’s fighter off a ledge into a pit of boiling lava.

“Damn that move is so over-powered,” complains Drew.  He suddenly groans and rubs his belly.  “Oh that chili dog I ate earlier isn’t sitting well,” he relates.  “Ugh...I will be right back,” he says as he gets up and heads to the washroom.  “Oh yeah, feel free to get a drink or something from the fridge if you want,” he calls from the hallway as he leaves your sight.

You take his suggestion and grab a soda from the fridge.  As you head back to the living room, you pass the bathroom and hear a soft whimper-like sound.  An awkward sense of deja vu seizes you.  //Fucking please say that isn’t what I think it is.//  You were in the next damn room!  Yet maybe that proximity was the problem.  //Nah, Drew has good self-control...I hope,// you dubiously assure yourself.

You hear a soft groan and then Drew grunts in relief on the other side of the door.  //Gross!// you think as some dirty poop joke comes to mind.  Or maybe he was really mastur---//No//, you can’t let yourself think about //that// incident.  You will definitely suffer from recurring nightmares.

You suppress a shiver of disgust and head back to the living room.
You turn off the game and see a new episode of one of your favourite shows.  You change the channel and sip on your soda.  

//Mmmm...Cherry.//  It has been a long damn time since you’ve had one.  //Too long.//  You laugh as you remember an moment from years earlier involving you, Drew, and Evan and several stained tongues from various slushie combinations during a convenience store madness sale when they were 25 cents each.  //So many slushies.//  You imagine that one week alone increased your chance of getting diabetes by at least 50%.

Perhaps you are putting your friends in danger by even asking for their help, but you know that there is strength in numbers and besides...they want to help you...just not while working side by side.
	
	“Evan.  Drew.  My life is //fucked.//  Please help me deal with this,” you implore your friends with pleading eyes.  “I don’t want to end up as an experiment...I don’t want to //die,//” you confide in your friends.  Your words and the emotional edge to your voice clearly has an impact on your companions.
	
	“We will definitely help you, Taylor,” Drew assures you.  “Right, Evan?” he presses your other friend.
	
	“Yeah, of course,” Evan agrees.  “Anything you need!  I am sure that if our situations were reversed you wouldn’t let me get dissected either.”
	
	“Ugh...//dissected//… fuck… and you guys wonder why I might be a little bit concerned?  Lately I have been watching these crazy vidtube videos...and //wow// the world is a scary place.”
	
	“Yeah, man!  Vidtube knows //everything//.  My cousin just bought five hundred pounds of Premium Bone Broth from Alexander Jones.  It sounds disgusting, costs a fortune, and supposedly tastes worse than it sounds but holy fuck the //benefits,// man.  My cousin said he would share with me when the chaos from the next magnetic pole reversal kicks in.  That is like //totally// top quality broth, braw...who is wearing a bra, hah.”
	
	“Shut up.  I have to wear one otherwise creeps like you will stare at my nipples!” [[you yell at Evan.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="Search by yourself" tags="" position="9295,7298" size="100,100">After some careful thought, you decide it is best not to involve your friends in whatever you have gotten caught up in.  It might be even dangerous for all you know.  Until you learn more, you think it is best to keep them at arm’s length - for the safety of everyone involved.

Still, going it alone with no leads isn’t very appealing at all.  Yet you need to start somewhere.

You walk outside as you mull over your course of action.  After a time, a few ideas occur to you.

In the end, you decide to:

[[Go home and search the internet]]
[[Search for leads on campus]]
[[Go to the hospital and see if you can get some tests done]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="Go to the pizzeria with Evan" tags="" position="2444,8438" size="100,100">A short walk later you arrive at the pizzeria.  It is surprisingly crowded owing in part to the special and in part due to the quality.

You order a large supreme pizza and a couple of draft beers.  The beer goes down easy after a long stressful day.  You decide to order another round while you wait for your pizza.

When it finally arrives the two of you pig out.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pizzeria.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Sadly, your stomach seems to have shrunken with the rest of you and you are only able to eat two slices before your pace slows to nothing.

You zone out for a moment and notice Evan staring at you.  The conversation ceases and suddenly you feel a bit strange, as a nervous air seizes hold of your little bubble.

“To be honest...I have had a thing for Julie for years,” Evan finally breaks the silence.

The admission catches you off guard.  You knew most of your friends found Julie attractive but this seems to go deeper.

You begin to respond but find yourself fumbling for the right words.   
“That’s ...gross,” you manage.

“Not really.  If you take away the fact she is your sister I bet you would find her really hot too.”

“Uh… I don’t know about that.”  Maybe Evan was right.  Or maybe he was a huge moron, it was hard to tell sometimes.

[[Let Evan Keep rambling]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="Go watch a movie with Evan" tags="" position="2448,8593" size="100,100">Maybe it was the beer you had just guzzled, or perhaps it was just the atmosphere of the beautiful night you wanted to continue, but you decide to go to Evan’s place despite the nagging of a small warning voice inside your head.

The two of you walk to Evan’s nearby duplex.  His parents had a similar arrangement to yours, purchasing a small duplex near the university to rent out.  You know from previous visits that Evan has two roommates but luckily they do not appear to be present tonight.

You follow Evan to his room and suddenly feel a tinge of anxiety.  As you step into Evan’s room- his lair, you feel something is definitely off.  You had been in this room dozens of times over the past year and had been perfectly comfortable, even passing out once on the floor more than once.  Due to the often annoying roommates, Evan had set up his TV in his room for privacy and to prevent interruptions.

Evan doesn’t seem to notice your discomfort, flicking on the TV and flicking through the movie lists.

“See what you can find,” Evan says as he tosses you the remote.  “I will be right back.”  He slips out of the room and you begin scrolling through the list of movies.

You find a few movies worth watching and wait in silence.  Several minutes go by and you find your gaze wandering around Evan’s room.  He has trophies from a variety of sports scattered around his room.  You notice most of them are 2nd or 3rd place wins.  Respectable showings, far more impressive than your own athletic exploits.

“Where the heck did he go?” you wonder as look over a pile of random clutter.  You pick up what appears to be a sports magazine and notice a pair of Evan’s boxer shorts underneath.
[[Wait for Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="Call it a night" tags="" position="2144,8595" size="100,100">	The sensible thing to do is to call it a night, so that&#39;s what you decide to do.  You walk home and dive into potential research into your condition.  You find the quality of information to be poor so come up with a new strategy.  Instead of randomly searching by yourself, you appeal to the collective mind of the internet.
	
	You pick out a dozen good &quot;sciencey&quot; sounding forums and post your quandary under the heading, &quot;I have a mad scientist friend…&quot;  You posit that a mysterious friend has claimed to have developed a technology capable of altering a labrat&#39;s dna and altering their sex among other things.
	
After a few minutes you quickly gain some replies.

	&quot;It is impossible,&quot; reads the first reply.
	
	&quot;Is your friend this guy?&quot; wonders the next poster, adding a picture of Dr. Frankenstein.
	
	&quot;Nanotechnology?  DNA alteration therapy?  Could be a mutation of some kind...or most likely explanation: your &quot;friend&quot; is full of shit.&quot;
	
	&quot;Stupid thread.  Waste of time.  [[Author is a troll.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="108" name="Go to the washroom" tags="" position="2448,8747" size="100,100">You are walking towards the bathroom when you suddenly hear a noise.

“Hello!” booms a deep voice from behind you.

The sudden sound scares the shit out of you.  

You turn to face the new arrival and see a very large and quite muscular dark skinned man standing before you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tim.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hello!  I am Tim,” he introduces himself with a shockingly deep bass voice.

“Uh, hey?  How’s it going?” you manage to awkwardly respond.

He smiles, showing a huge mouth full of square white teeth.  “I am good and you?  What’s your name?”

“I feel pretty great...uh, I am Taylor,” you manage to ungracefully introduce yourself.  “You’re--”

“Evan’s roommate,” he finishes.   “I didn’t break in or anything,” he adds.

You laugh at his joke.

Your eyes drift back to the bathroom longingly and Tim takes the hint. 

“Cya around,” he says as he goes into his room and shuts the door.
[[Run to the bathroom]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="Continue the movie" tags="" position="2446,8897" size="100,100">The movie continues predictably without incident until the two main characters finally reunite and culminate their romance in a surprisingly long and vivid sex scene.

It may have just been in your mind, but it seems like the longest sex scene of your life, almost like watching one with your parents.  The worst part is that it is actually tastefully done and surprisingly hot.

//Uh oh...//  There is more than a small part of you that is quickly becoming turned on while the rational part of your mind shouts at you to regain control.

You can just make out Evan shifting uncomfortably in his seat in your peripheral.

“Wow…” you say, caught off guard by your high pitched squeak.  You feel your cheeks and ears flush.  You feel like you are burning up.  When you work up your courage, you look over at Evan you see he appears to be a similar mindset.  His face is red too, whether from the drinks or the movie, you cannot tell.  You lock eyes with Evan and your heart sinks.  //Or maybe he is reacting to something else?  Er, someone else...like me?//

You suppress a shiver as the moment stretches on.

“Hey Taylor…” Evan begins and immediately your hackles rise.  His tone is hoarse, full of need and longing.

You feel pretty stupid for coming here like this.  You feel drunk and bubbly, like you could be dared to do anything.  

[[Listen to Evan&#39;s request]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="110" name="Pass out" tags="" position="2595,9094" size="100,100">You wake up with a splitting headache.  //Ugh...//

You tap your phone when you notice its flashing indicator.

“I am really sorry about last night.  Let me make it up to you,” Evan’s message reads.

“Going to take a lot to do that,” you text back.

“I found out some information that might help you.  Meet me at the science building in 30.”

You’re still mad at Evan.  He definitely crossed the line but you haven’t had many other worthwhile leads.

Curious what he may have for you, you go to the science building and meet Evan.

“What did you find out?” you bluntly ask your friend.

“I can’t tell you how I found this out but this might be related to what happened to you.”

“Go on.”

“I heard that a &quot;mysterious donor&quot; has appeared.  They have funded a number of new cutting edge science projects here at the university.”

“Hmm… and maybe one of their experiments got loose and contaminated me?”

“Maybe, I dunno.”

“What else did you find out?”

“You’re going to love this...er, maybe not.”

“Out with it!” 

“Guess who just so happened to get a generous research grant, funded by the mysterious donor?”

“I am not fucking playing guessing games!”

“Mr. Deter.”

Evan’s revelation leaves you stunned.  “He did have access to me...we have class three times a week…”  Mr. Deter being involved seemed a tad unlikely but it was the most compelling idea that had presented itself.

“Well, helpful?”

“Yes, very.  There might be something to all this.  It is worth checking out anyway and more than I have found on my own.  Thank you, Evan.”

“My pleasure!  Now, um, about my...er “reward”?” he asks you.

[[“Your what!?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="Agree with him" tags="" position="2294,9490" size="100,100">“I guess you might be right…” you find yourself at least partially agreeing with your friend.

“Well?  Let’s start right now!”

“What?”

“Jimmy just texted me.  How about some booze and cards?” Evan suggests.
“That sounds….”  

“Great!” Evan finishes your sentence for you, although with different word choice.

Well you already agreed in a sense, so you offer no protest as Evan rushes you out the door and across the campus to an adjoining residential section.

Evan knocks and Jimmy answers.  You recognize Jimmy from soccer and a few summer parties.  He is a tall young man with dark hair and a scraggly beard.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/jimmy.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
[[Drink and play cards]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Dispute his reasoning" tags="" position="2598,9449" size="100,100">You decide to refute Evan’s bullshit.  “Evan---//shut up!// I am a man - not a goddess and you can go //fuck yourself!//  Use your hand and leave me the fuck alone!” you shout at him as you storm off.  You always suspected Evan was a bit //fruity!//  His actions since your transformation are inexplicable.  No wonder he doesn’t have a girlfriend, the guy is such a creep!

//What the hell is with everyone lately?  Why the fuck do all the men seem so attracted to me!?// you wonder as you head home, cutting through the middle of campus.

As you are walking along, you pass by a campus park and your eyes are drawn to a familiar blotch of red hair.

[[Move closer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="113" name="Play strip poker" tags="" position="2350,9740" size="100,100">Since you have a good buzz going and you have always been a confident card player, you decide to play strip poker.  //Probably not the greatest idea, but what could go wrong?  I definitely don’t want to be dared into doing something gross but I can&#39;t resist a little bit of gambling.//

“Let’s play poker!” you announce.

Evan and Jimmy grin at each other right before Evan begins to explain the rules.  

“Everyone will get a hundred bucks of chips to start but once you are out, you will have to bet clothes and, of course, if you lose a hand you will have to strip! Folding on the first round is okay though. Each article of clothing represents a ten chip.  Once your clothes are off you can’t buy them back.”

You look down at your T shirt with a frown.  //Fuck, these are pretty high stakes!  And there definitely isn’t much margin for error...//

One of the other guys at the table, a young man who’s name now escapes you, gets up and disappears in the kitchen.  A moment later he returns with a fresh round of drinks.

“Thanks Robbie!  You are //the// man!” Jimmy shouts when he has a new drink in hand.

As you sip at your beer, your eyes happen to catch Sam’s.  She shoots you a shy smile and you can’t help [[but flinch and look away.]]  //Maybe tonight is finally the night my dream comes true and I get to see Sam naked...//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="Play Truth or Dare" tags="" position="2549,9738" size="100,100">“I choose... //Truth//,” you answer. 

“Booo!”  The crowd seems disappointed.

Rhea moves close to your face.  “How many times have you had sex?” she asks you.

You instantly feel warmth flood your cheeks as your embarrassment washes over you.  Whether male or female the answer wasn’t much different.  You had lost your virginity as a man but it had been such a brief and drunk affair that you doubted it was fair to even count it.  You haven&#39;t had sex as a woman and hopefully uou never will.

“Zero,” you finally admit.

“Oh-my-god!” Rhea and Sam say together, as if they had just uncovered an epic scandal.

“It is college, babe, live a little.  We have got to get you laid!  You aren’t religious or anything are you?” Rhea wonders.

“No, I am not,” you mumble.

“Wow, just wow.  //Taylor is a virgin!//  You have //so// been missing out!”  Rhea attests.  She smiles at you and gives you a wobbling nod.  “Trust me,” she loudly whispers.

The next round passes in a flash, with Sam and Jimmy admitting some of their darkest secrets.

You keep sipping at your drink, surprised to find it is now Rhea’s turn again.  She seems to have it out for you.

“Taylor I am giving you a dare,” Rhea informs you.

“Don’t I get to chose!?”

“Not anymore, I have to help you get out of your shell!” Rhea declares.

“Fine.”

“Okay.  Taylor, Evan, you two kiss.  Go!” she suddenly orders you.

“Wait!  What the hell!?  I don’t want to play this game anymore,” you protest.

“Too late!” Rhea yells back.

In disbelief you look up at Evan, seated next to you but still towering high above you.

You are about to flee from the room, when an idea strikes you.  She didn’t say where you had to kiss him!

You sit up as tall as you can and give Evan a peck on the cheek.

“Awwwwww!  Lame!” Rhea protests.  “That wasn’t a real kiss!”

“Too bad, bitch.  I followed the rules,” you tease Rhea.  &quot;Should have been more specific!&quot;  Rhea begins to pout and Sam and Jimmy laugh.  You notice Evan wasn’t laughing though, you glance up at him only to see him blushing profusely.

Next up was Jimmy.  “I want you to redo the last round; I dare you to do it properly.&quot;

“Why are you guys picking on me?  This game is rigged!” you yell at them.

“You’re just too cute and fun to tease.  We are //helping// you,” Rhea assures you.  Sam giggles at your dumb-faced reaction.

You begin to feel...//weird.//  Perhaps you have already drank too much, but you suddenly find yourself downing the last of your beer.

//Fuck...//

“Get to it!” Rhea waves you and Evan together, and like marionette&#39;s under command of a puppeteer, the two of you are drawn inexorably together.

[[Kiss Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="Keep going" tags="" position="2551,10248" size="100,100">No one moves.  You give Rhea a baleful look but she doesn’t waver.  You want to scream and run out of the room but allow yourself to take a deep breath.  You slowly turn your head to look at Evan.  He seems to be consciously avoiding your stare, waiting for you to make up your own decision on how to proceed.

“Oh for god’s sake you two!” Rhea huffed.  She scoots forward and grabs your right hand and places it firmly down on Evan’s bulging crotch.  Rhea pushes your hand back and forth on Evan’s growing erection, rubbing the croth of his pants.  “There, not so bad is it?” she says as she withdraws her hand, leaving yours loosely clutching the outline of Evan’s dick.

Whether drunk or just curious, you find yourself continuing the motion and running a slender finger around the outline of his bulge.

You are taken aback at his apparent size.

“Taylor…” Evan moans.  //Oh my god what am I doing?  This is going to far--yet I can’t seem to stop.//  It felt good to please another person.  You have always been a pretty generous, helpful person.  Your friend is clearly in need.  You recall how uncomfortable such a straining erection could be. Evan looks so happy as you touched him that you almost though it would be a bit of shame to just leave him hanging.

The dizzy feeling returns, much more intense than before.  

[[Give Evan a handjob]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="116" name="Pass time" tags="" position="2356,11287" size="100,100">The next day passes by in a blur.  You try and read up on cutting edge nanotech and biochem theories but everything goes over your head.

You decide having someone to go through them with you would be helpful.  Just as you pick up your phone, a text from Evan arrives.

After a brief exchange he invites himself over and it isn’t long before he arrives and is just as bored as you are.

“Ughh… I wish I paid more attention in school,” you mutter as you slam shut a textbook Evan had grabbed from the university library.

Evan sighs in agreement. He does look pretty haggard.  “It has been a really long day,” he begins as he turns to you.  “I have been really stressed lately and was up late doing research to help you out.”

“I do really appreciate it,” you reply.  You speak honestly, knowing trying to get anywhere by yourself would be very difficult.  

“I am happy to help.  Being friends is all about give and take, we look out for each other, right?”

“Yep!  That’s what friends are for,” you agree.

“Say Taylor, is there any way I could get another one of those great handjobs?” Evan asks you.  He says the words in the same tone as if asking to borrow an eraser during class.  You are absolutely shocked at his boldness.  You do owe him a favour or ten, accumulated over the years, but this is a bit much to ask.

“What the hell man?”

“Oh come on.  You already did it once before, and I am really hurting.  I promise I won’t tell anyone too of course!  I just //really// need this.”

“You have got to be kidding me.  Once was enough for a hundred lifetimes.”

“I am not kidding, look,” he says.  Evan takes off his pants and underwear, leaving his T-shirt on.  Below the waist, his long meaty cook was standing at full attention.

You stare at his dick, wondering how in the world it has come to this. //Again.// “Please,” Evan pleads.  “I really need this Taylor.  You’re the only one I can ask.  If our situations were reversed you know I would totally help you out.”

His rationale seems stupid like usual but he seems to be telling the truth.  “Oh for fuck’s sake!  Fine,” you say, feeling defeated.  Without further ado, you sit down next to him and begin jerking your best friend off.

[[Give Evan a handjob...again...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="God damnit Evan!" tags="" position="2348,11444" size="100,100">You are eager to leave and borrow a sweater from Evan to wear home.  As you slide it over your head you inhale a musky scent.  //Evan’s scent.//  As you return home, you feel like a part of him goes with you.
&lt;&lt;if $strippath is true&gt;&gt;  
The next day, your phone rings with Evan’s ID on display.  You push away a tome about gender dysphoria and debate continuing or letting Evan distract you.  You can either [[Answer the call]] or ignore it and keep working.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You decide to keep &quot;working&quot;.  Two days fly by and you don’t do much of anything, except troll the internet.

“Found something cool,” Evan eventually texts you.

Eager for the excuse to finally leave the house, you head over to Evan’s.

“What did you find?” you ask him after you arrive.

&quot;Check it out.&quot;  Evan hands you a dvd.  //That&#39;s Ultimate Alien Attack 4//!

“Whoa!  Fucking cool!  Where did you get this?”

“It took some hard dealing,” Evan modestly replies.  The series is one of your favorites and the fourth film was the rarest of them all.

“This must have cost a fortune…”

“Worth it just to see the look on your face.”

“Uhh...Thanks, Evan.  I really appreciate it.”  The gift is very thoughtful, you can’t even recall mentioning the series specifically to Evan.

“So are we going to watch this or what?” he prompts you.

[[“Right now?  Sure!”]]

“Fine Evan, I will give you what you deserve,” you say as you move your head towards Evan’s groin.

As you approach, you see that Evan’s excitement is plain, the huge, aching bulge is obvious.  //Oh my god what the fuck am I doing?// you idly wonder.  What you’re doing seems like a bad idea but that hardly stops you anymore.  With shaking fingers, you pull down Evan’s fly.  You reach inside and free Evan’s manhood, it springs to immediate attention in front of your eyes. The potent smell and the immense size again catches you off guard.

You shouldn&#39;t like looking at his dick but it mesmerizes you.

“Oh...wow…” you manage to say as Evan stands and shimmies out of his pants and boxers.  Soon he is naked from the waist down and sitting before you, open legged, looking like a comfortable king sitting upon his throne.

You look up at Evan, his tall, toned body towering above you.  He gives you a blissful smile of approval.  You know there is no backing out now.

“This sucks!” you rage.  “Everything sucks!  My life especially….Hmm...speaking of sucking…”  You can’t help but remember your last night spent with Evan.  For some reason in your mind a blowjob was much more sexual than a release by hand.  Now you have done both, each a progressive escalation down a path that really frightens you.  Evan’s a pretty cool guy and all, but you certainly don’t want to have sex with him or get roped into something bizarre that you will surely regret when….if you ever find a way to turn back.

You notice a flashing light on your phone.
“Sup?” reads a text from Evan.
“NM U?”
“Kind of bored, want to come over? :)”
“No.”
“Y not?”
“You know why, CREEP.”
“That’s not fair.  I owe you and I already got something to help.”
“What have you got?” you text back.
“Neat stuff from my dad, plundered from his work. :)”

No matter where you looked there was no information of value to be had beyond superficial hooks.  It took so much effort to chase down every pointless thread, which inevitably unravelled to nothing.  Your ordeal with Mitch had sapped your time and energy outside of class and it wasn’t long before a part of you begins to give up.

The days drift by.  You have begun to doubt that you will ever be able to change back into a man but you can’t bring yourself to give up hope quite yet.

The next day you go to check out the university bio lab.  It has been on your list to check out for a while.  The whole place is full of high tech equipment and thousands of experiments.  It just might be the perfect place for a lead that may lead to a cure.  You spend the afternoon looking around, checking out random projects and rooms.

“Know anyone doing uh... gender research?” you ask a man standing in the hallway. 

 “Heh gender studies?  You will find those in the arts building,” he answers with a snicker.

“No, I mean like genetic gender reversal in animals,” you clarify.  “Certain species of fish are capable of changing gender to fit the needs of the species,” you throw the somewhat random factoid out in an effort to convince the man of your intentions.

The man’s face straightens.  “Hmm, that’s actually quite interesting.  I haven’t heard of anything like that before.  Big place though, lots of faculty and students, so there is lots of stuff going on.  They keep most of the high tech and sensitive research in the restricted section.  You will need access granted from one of the project holders or from upper faculty.”

“Don’t mope, you’re gorgeous!” your sister chides you.

“I don’t want to be gorgeous!”

Your sister laughs.  “Hands up, over your head please.”

Apparently you have become used to her commands, or at least lost your will to fight.  You raise your arms up.  Suddenly your sister pulls your shirt off in one fluid motion, leaving your huge appearing breasts to bounce free.

“What the hell?” you screech as your sister gleefully cups your tender breasts.

“Wow!  As good as mine, maybe even better,” your sister comments as she fondles your boobs.

By the time you arrive, you have already thought of a few topics to google, yet, as you step through the threshold, you are suddenly distracted by the sound of laughter.

You see Julie is openly making out with her boyfriend on the couch.

When you enter they break off and Julie greets you excitedly.  “~Taylor!  Welcome home!” she shouts, sounding more than a bit drunk.

“Hey Julie…” you greet your sister.

Suddenly Julie’s companion takes up all of your attention as he fills your vision.  He is a tall, handsome, and quite athletic man.  He is well dressed and has mesmerizing blue eyes and an ever-present trace of stubble.  He shoot you a beaming, confident smile.  To you, Ryan was once everything that you had admired and aspired to be as a man.

You spend an hour at a campus terminal accessing some library records, hoping you could find some thread to pursue within the University’s own research departments.

After zoning out reading a boring index, you find a somewhat randomly placed link to a sub database and then search that.

A flood of promising new academic papers flood your screen.

Your hopes rise and fall several times as you look through the list until, finally you stumble on something of note.

One of them is written by a name that stands out, a shockingly familiar //Dr.J.Deter//.

“Mechanized Atomic Ribonucleic Restructuring…   HOLY FUCK, JACKPOT!”
“SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!” shushes a nearby librarian, shooting you a withering glare.

“I am glad you won the lottery, but please be considerate and keep your voice down, miss,” the librarian chides you as you awkwardly shimmy by her and dart into the hallway.

You give your sister a small smile.  Julie was known to swear on occasion, but she was never really your match in the cussing department.
“What’s wrong?” Ryan wonders.
“I just got called into work.  Damnit.”  Your sister worked at a restaurant catering to high end clientele.  The place was quite busy and you know for a fact the tips she earned while working there worked out to an hourly wage that would make a lawyer blush.  Since it was such an exclusive place with high income, the slots for servers working there were highly contested and so was the incentive to work, especially if they needed help.
“Aww, that really sucks!  I was looking forward to spending some time together tonight, this is my only real day off until next week,” Ryan says while looking ashen faced.
“I know… me too,” Julie laments.
Ryan looks at his cellphone clock.  “Hmm… I still have a few hours before I have to go in myself.  Our night shift supervisors need some supervision of their own apparently.”
“No sense driving all the way back and then returning,” Julie agrees.  “You might as well stay and keep Taylor company.  Then after we are both done work…” your sister leaves the suggestion lingering in the air.
“That sounds awesome.  You don’t mind if I hang around, do you Taylor?”
“Uh, no, it’s fine.  Do as you please,” you tell him as you take a seat on the big couch in your living room and begin to pull the laptop out of your backpack.
“Cool!” he says as falls back on the other end of the couch you’re sitting on.  You are suddenly very glad it is a big couch.  Your sister quickly changes and gets ready and soon departs, keys jingling in hand.  
“No funny business!” she shouts at the two of you as he leaves.  //Was that warning necessary?//
“Hah, funny business is the best kind of business!” Ryan says, imparting his sage advice.  “Hard to go through life without smiling, right Taylor?”  He shoots you his trademark sterling grin.
“Uh, yep,” you reply with a weak imitation of Ryan’s toothy display.

You are Taylor Roux (pronounced &quot;R-oo&quot;), an average, introverted, and slightly nerdy university student.  Taylor is short, slight of build, and unremarkable in most respects except for his well known potty mouth.  The kind of guy that gets lost in a crowd and is forgotten not long after introductions.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan Moore - has been one of your friends for as long as you can remember. He is in decent shape and is tall and somewhat skinny, with a mop of dark hair that he usually keeps short.  He is also more than a bit of a perv.   While not much of an athlete, he usually spends his time watching and playing sports as well as sport themed videogames.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drew.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Drew Drachmann -is an overweight nerd who spends most of his time indoors, at his computer.  He usually wears glasses and unfashionable clothes and has curly brown hair that has never seen a comb. He is quite intelligent and a good guy though, albeit more than a bit eccentric. You have been friends for ages and get along well for the most part, except when Drew gets in one of his “weird” moods.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/julie.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Julie Roux - is your older sister, she is kind of haughty despite being a huge slut.  She is very attractive with big brown eyes and long, straight chestnut hair.  She has an ample chest and a nice ass, as you are frequently reminded by your friends.  She is a lot like you complexion and feature wise, just female.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Ryan - is your sister’s current long term boyfriend, a businessman from the city.  He is tall, dark, and handsome with an intense blue-eyed gaze and a ready smile.  His work and experience might lead Taylor to some valuable clues.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mitch - is a bully from school that you have scuffled with previously.  A gym rat who deals drugs and goes out of his way to pick on anyone he feels is weak. Mitch is a real dickhead you should probably avoid antagonizing.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deter.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mr. Deter - is a creepy teacher from school that teaches psychology and also works in the university’s bio research labs.  He has expertise in multiple disciplines and isn’t afraid to brag about it.  He has a huge belly and a thick, stalinesque handlebar moustache.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sam.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Sam - is short for Samantha.  She is bright eyed and perky, a very beautiful redhead woman.  She seems intelligent and a lot more reserved than most of your friends.  You have had a crush on her for a few years but never had the courage to act.  She is good friends with Rhea and Jimmy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rhea.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Rhea - pronounced “Ray”, is a beautiful buxom blonde who loves male attention.  She is really outgoing and sexually aggressive.  You get the impression more than a few dicks have penetrated her over the years.  Her constant sexual jokes and conversation topics usually make you very uncomfortable.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/jimmy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Jimmy - is a tall lanky guy with a scraggly beard and a penchant for heavy drinking and sniffing out fun parties.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damien.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien - An old acquaintance that always made you a bit uneasy.  He is funny and well liked but turns into a huge asshole with no self control with even a sip of alcohol.  You recall your sister and several of her friends complaining about him and the sexual advances he often made during any number of his near constant benders.  Despite this, he is undeniably a brilliant young scientist...perhaps precisely the person to help you research your predicament.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tim.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Tim - Evan&#39;s charming and very well hung roomie.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bloommed.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Dr. Fantasia Bloom -the strong-willed and very curvy Dr. Fantasia Bloom is a female foil to Mr. Deter&#39;s insanity.  Dr. Bloom is a woman who exudes an air of authority.  She is a woman of means, intelligence, and power.  She is the daughter of a shipping magnate.  Dr. Bloom was afforded every advantage and, unlike most in her position, she squandered very little if any of her potential and used her advantages to accelerate her growth and sharpen an already sharp razor-wit into a force to be reckoned with.  According to her wiki entry, Dr. Bloom now heads one of the leading nanotechnology development firms, within a giant consortium of other commercial and scientific interests that spans the globe.  But Fantasia&#39;s firm has a troubling reputation.  There are also rumors of strange experiments being conducted on corporate property.  Observers note that Dr. Bloom’s most outspoken colleagues often have a habit of disappearing shortly after crossing the Doctor.  Fantasia is busty, mature, and utterly fearless while being absolutely peerless in her numerous fields of expertise.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/louise.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Louise - is a dominant lesbian woman who is fond of punk rock and rebellious philosophies.  Louise is very sexually aggressive and masculine while Rhea is definitely more on the feminine side of this spectrum. Louise hates authority figures and is eager to rebel against the status quo. Louise probably would have been happy to have been born a man, but her lack of a dick has never stopped her from getting her share of pussy.  Louise takes what she wants and she doesn&#39;t take shit from anyone, especially a man.  Louise is also fiercely protective of those she cares about.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sophie.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Sophie Bell - A beautiful, empathetic young woman with a kind heart who has been broken by life&#39;s circumstances.  Sophie is a pretty blonde, a slender wisp of a woman.  Sophie has been traumatized by several recent events in her life.  Maybe if Taylor exercises some patience and kindness, perhaps one day Sophie&#39;s brilliant smile will return to shine again.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sandra.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Sandra Bell - Sophie&#39;s mother and a good friend of the Roux family.  She is a fiery, mature, and busty woman who firmly fits into the MILF category.  Sandra never minces words and always says what is on her mind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craig.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Craig Bell - The Bell&#39;s adopted son, born with severe mental and physical handicaps.  Craig is usually fairly placid but it is clear Craig&#39;s mind works in a different manner than most.  Taylor has a weird feeling about this guy...
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mrbell.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mr Bell is Craig’s adopted father and Sophie’s biological dad. He is a businessman of some kind. You always found him to be an entertaining and kind host. He clearly adores his wife, Sandra, although he seems to have a roving eye…

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucas.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas Ferret - is an executive of a company with a very suspicious name.  Ferret (pronounced “Fair-Eh”) is Mr. Deter&#39;s former partner.  Lucas is a man defined by his ambition and lustful greed.  Lucas is an older &quot;gentleman&quot; who is always well dressed.  He is known to be ruthless and cunning in the business world and is probably someone who should not be taken lightly.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victoria.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Victoria is a Trans Corp Special Director working for Lucas Ferret in the Human Resources Department. She is a stunning young blonde woman with sharp blue eyes and a sly smile. Victoria is tall, slender, and elegant. Her scattered moles and beauty marks do nothing to mar her exceptional good looks. When she enters the room, she seems to suck half the oxygen right out of it. Despite her apparent youth, Victoria seems to be entrusted with a lot of responsibility.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/marg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Margaret Roux - Your adoring and overly sensitive mother.  Being around her is suffocating but you love your mother dearly.  You just don&#39;t want to live with or near her.  Marg recently went through a mid-life crisis as you went off to university across the country.  She has embraced her newfound passion of real estate and now spends her time trying to sell homes to rich people.  In this manner, your mother went from one extreme of the spectrum to the other, from a house wife to a budding business woman.  She now works an absurd amount and has become uncharacteristically distant as of late.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/teddy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Teddy Roux - Your father. Mr. Roux works as a minor executive in a large research company. You think your dad did a pretty good job raising you and your sister.  He was always honest and blunt and was a good listener whenever you needed to vent or a shoulder to lean your head on.  His advice has also saved you and gotten you into trouble more times than you can count. Your dad has been a bit moody and quiet the past few years and you have been worried about him.  You suspect he and your mom might be having some troubles, possibly due to your father&#39;s traveling schedule and frequent absences.  You aren&#39;t worried about them getting divorced though because you know that Teddy can be quite charismatic when he wants to be and you are certain he can re-charm your mom once she finishes building her real estate empire.

The Envoy - is an odd looking man who claims to represent a mysterious spy network known as “the Agency.”  With his gangly limbs and unusual features and mannerisms, the Envoy almost looks a tad inhuman.  It is clear that the Envoy is well informed and intelligent, while obviously being backed by mysterious powers with substantial means.  The Envoy seems earnest but it is clear he has motivations that may not necessarily align with your own.   


Minor Characters:

Taylor Quicksilver - is a famous singer and idol for millions of young women.  She famous for her youthful melodies, long legs, and elegant style.

&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="Have a bath" tags="" position="12458,13744" size="100,100">You decide to have a bath,  You throw in some bubbles too for good measure because bubbles are fucking awesome.
You sink into the warm water with a satisfied sigh.  A sigh that sounds a bit too much like a sensual purr for your own liking.  This body was hard enough to live with let alone with you having such a different voice and vocal range.  You know you could probably kick some ass at karaoke.  Being sexy was kind of fun too, but that was beside the point!  The attention and perks were nice but you knew they just as well would attract a bunch of weirdos and jerks.  The life of a sexy young minx wasn’t all fun and games!
Your line of thought causes you to sigh again and then sigh in response to your sigh. //Fuck if I do this I will just go into a loop of moaning.  I really hope Julie doesn’t come back.//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bath2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;896px&quot; height=&quot;672px&quot;&gt;

You enjoy your time soaking in the tub.  You try and forget all the stressful shit bothering you.  You stretch out your hairless legs and suddenly get the urge to massage the suds into them.  

“Ohhhh…. That feels so good,” you moan.  Soon your hands roam farther afield and you are stroking the outside of your burning slit.  With a mixture of slow rotations on your clit and gradual shallow shlicking with your middle finger, you are soon brought over the edge.

“God damn this lewd body,” you scold yourself as you sink under the bubbly water in embarrassment.

[[Later that night...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="Try and work on your laptop" tags="" position="12458,12645" size="100,100">You try and make polite conversation as you open up your laptop and type out a few notes but it is difficult as Ryan attempts to engage with you in conversation.  It is hard to do anything with him //distracting// you like that.  //Ryan sure is friendly tonight,// you can’t help but note.

“So, Taylor, what do you do for fun around here?” he finally asks you.
You sigh.  Ryan is a difficult fellow to ignore.  “I am a bit of a nerd,” you admit.  “I really like video games too.”
“Oh?”  Ryan seems surprised.  “Most beautiful women don’t become avid gamers for some reason.”
The off-handed compliment makes you double-blink.  “It is because they are stupid, why cultivate intelligence if you can get whatever you want with a smile and a low-cut shirt?” you muse.
“Hahaha!” Ryan’s rich, cheerful laugh surprises you.  “Maybe there is something to that.  So what’s your secret then?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well you’re clearly very smart //and// pretty.”
“Uh...That’s nice of you to say…”  //In a really creepy fucking way!//  Julie //just// left and he is already flirting with her “cousin”?  //What a horndog!// you think.  Yet a part of you is still impressed.  You always used to think Ryan was the kind of guy who could get any girl he wanted.  And yet he somehow ended up with your sister.  //And now he is taking an interest in me?//  You aren’t sure at all how to feel about that.  The idea is both flattering and super fucking weird at the same time.
“What’s your favourite game, Taylor?” Ryan asks you.
“I have too many to list.  Right now I am really enjoying //Kingdom Aces// and replaying some good classics like //Battle Frogs.//”
“Oh really?  I love that game!  You remember when the King Kong Frog jumps down and destroys half the planet you are fighting on?”
You laugh at the shared memory.  Ryan’s enthusiasm is a bit infectious and you get caught up in a protracted nerdy story explaining how you used a clever exploit to defeat a hundred “impossible” enemies at once.  You’re pleasantly surprised Ryan that appears to know what he is talking about.  After reminiscing about a few awesome in-game moments Ryan finally stops you.
“Whoa, whoa Taylor!  You talk a good game - but do you //play// one?”
You can’t help but laugh.  “You sound like a cheesy game commercial.  But, yeah, actually I do - and I will kick your fucking ass if you let me.”
“Well then, I just won’t //let// you then, eh?” he teases you.
“Hmph.”  You scowl at Ryan but he just grins back, clearly amused at your reactions.  //Fuck I probably can’t even grimace in this body without looking cute.//  Ryan’s arrogance annoys the heck out of you.  You can’t refuse his challenge.
“Bring on the frogs!” Ryan shouts.
“Bring on the frogs!” you agree.  You close your laptop, your plan to research your condition postponed.  You had frogs to battle!

[[Play the game with Ryan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="Play the game with Ryan" tags="" position="12600,12752" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/btcover.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The next three hours pass by so quickly you are absolutely floored when you glance at the clock.

You had become so absorbed in your quest to defeat Ryan that you had seriously lost track of time.

“Holy shit, it is late!” you comment.

You felt a tad guilty for putting off your “homework” but you had so much fun you forgot how fucked up your life was for an entire three thours!  That was quite a miracle in and of itself in your opinion.  You find Ryan to be as you expected: he’s funny, charming, and easy-going.  He wasn’t the greatest gamer but he put up a pretty damn impressive fight despite the obvious gap in experience.

Ryan notices you staring at the clock.  “I still got over an hour before I have to be at the office,” he informs you.  “Your cousin won’t be back for hours,” he adds.

“Uh, huh…”  Not quite sure what to do with the information, you just smile and nod at him.  “I got nowhere to be!” you say cheerily.

Suddenly Ryan shifts closer you, sitting directly next you on the couch.  “I am really glad I am here too,” Ryan says.

“I didn’t say that…but I did have fun,” you grudgingly admit.  You silently wish he would give you more space.  //Is it getting hot in here??// you wonder.

Ryan seems to focus on you, your presence taking up his complete attention.  He quietly studies you as you instinctively squirm under his gaze.  His closeness makes you deeply uncomfortable.  You can even smell his faint cologne, a fresh fragrance superimposed with a hint of cinnamon.  With every breath you inhale a small part of Ryan until your mind is tied in tangles by the alluring, heady scent.

[[Try and put some distance between you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="Try and put some distance between you" tags="" position="12454,12800" size="100,100">Just as you are about to awkwardly stand and get a drink of water in an effort to distance yourself from Ryan, he suddenly hits you with a tender confession.
“You know what, Taylor?  It is obvious, you are a very special woman.  I think you’re really cool and that we should be friends.”
“Uh...thanks.”  //I am not a woman though…//  Just a few weeks ago, you would have jumped at the chance to be Ryan’s friend, yet now you can’t help but feel a bit conflicted.
You look up at Ryan for a moment.  //A really special woman.//  His words bounce around in your mind.  You have always wanted Ryan’s approval for as long as you have known him ...but it was quite surreal to get it like this.
“Hey, Taylor, may I ask you something?”
“What?”
“Do you have a boyfriend?” he enquires bluntly .
“//Boyfriend!?//  What?  No!”  You are about to castigate him for such a random question when it finally occurs to you why he is curious.
“I can’t believe a stunning, obviously brilliant, young woman like yourself is single,” he confides in you.
A strange uneasy feeling that had been present all night suddenly flares to full force.  You curse your new hormones as you flush bright red at his words.  You know you shouldn’t react the way you are, yet you can’t seem to help it.  You become conscious that your heart is suddenly beating //very// fast.

The two of you then lock eyes and the tension in the room increases exponentially.  //Why is he staring at me like that… What the hell is wrong with him?//

Yet it was you that felt strange.  It was easy to blame Ryan but you only had control over your own actions.
//What’s wrong with ME?// You wonder as you feel the sweat drip and run down the small of your back.

//I need to get out of here.  I need to...I need to… to...move...now!// 

[[Try and stand up]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="Try and stand up" tags="" position="12602,12903" size="100,100">You find your legs to be like jelly.  You cannot move.  You strain to rise and flee but find yourself falling just short of the threshold.

Yet despite every ounce of your willpower, you are unable to muster any response, suddenly lost in Ryan’s big, oddly comforting blue eyes.

You blink once and suddenly they are a lot closer, appearing so large they will swallow you up.  //Nooooooooo!// your mind howls as Ryan’s nose gently brushes your own as he leans in for a kiss.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Mmmm!”

Ryan’s mouth covers yours and your lips press together firmly.  The seconds tick on, stretching the moment on to infinity before time retches back to the present.  Your eyes bulge and your arms move to push him off of you but you find Ryan’s muscular chest to be immobile.  “Mmmgff!” you groan in protest, but Ryan just holds you steadily while his lips gently meet and massage your own, touching and withdrawing in a strange dance, gradually prying your mouth open for Ryan’s tongue to violate.

[[Why is this happening to me?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="Try and sleep" tags="" position="12604,13043" size="100,100">Soon you are locked inside your room, heart and stomach still aflutter.  You feel almost feverishly hot.  //Fucking hell!//  You resolve to avoid Ryan at all costs.  You lie down in bed and burrow under the covers but find sleep to be elusive.

Why did that all that have to happen to you?

It takes a while but you fall asleep waking up to the noise and vibration of a door slamming.  You try and return to sleep but it doesn’t take.  You can hear muffled voices outside in the hall.   //Ryan and Julie...//

You ears can’t help but perk up and strain and listen.  You hear a banging noise as the pair enter your sister’s room.  Ryan says something and your sister giggles.  You imagine them fall naked together on the bed, listening and following the the sound of their cues, observing them as if through mental x-ray goggles.

You hear your sister speaking but can’t quite make out the words.  You hear another loud noise followed by laughter.  It goes quiet for a moment before the silence is broken by your sister’s slutty moans.  “Ohhhh…..Oh!  Oh!”  You listen to your sister through the wall, not sure whether to curse or be thankful for the paper thin walls.  You can feel the vibrations and hear the bouncing of the bed’s springs.  Soon the noise is all you can hear...and think about.

Your pussy feels very warm.

//Ahhh!  Fucking hell!//  You decide to:

[[Go take a peek]]
[[Put on music and a pillow over your head and go to sleep]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="134" name="Go take a peek" tags="" position="12467,13193" size="100,100">Ears and pussy burning, you decide to creep forth and satisfy your curiosity and maybe get a little fodder to satisfy your other urges as well.  You enter the hallway, quiet as a mouse and move towards your sister’s door.  Luckily in their haste, the pair of lovers left the door open a crack.  With a single finger you gradually pry the door open and manage to peer inside.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/ryanjulie.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 
 

The sight that greets you steals the breath from your throat.  Ryan is fucking your sister from behind, both of them moaning and moving in obvious pleasure.  Both Ryan and Julie are still partially clothed, apparently so eager to fuck that they couldn’t even wait to strip first.  Your sister is bent over the edge of the bed while Ryan fucks her from behind, doggy style.

[[You watch them with morbid fascination.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="135" name="Put on music and a pillow over your head and go to sleep" tags="" position="12747,13096" size="100,100">under construction</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="136" name="You hear a distant knocking sound" tags="" position="12604,13445" size="100,100">The next morning you snap awake to a knock at your door.

You open the door and find Ryan awkwardly standing on the other side.  With his close presence, you immediately feel anxious.  
“Hey I wanted to apologize about last night,” he began.  “On the couch there.  That was wrong of me, I just got swept up in the moment.  The truth is...I haven’t played games in like a year and I don’t really get to do stuff like that anymore and it was just really fun and nostalgic, you know?  And then I looked at you and you are just so beautiful and //familiar// and I just sort of lost control.  I apologize, I am not like that normally,” he assures you, appearing earnest and remorseful.

He stares at you, waiting for you to reply but you find your response to be unusually slow.  “I-it’s okay,” you manage to respond and Ryan looks relieved.  “I think I know how you feel,” you add after a moment and instantly regret speaking.

At your last comment, Ryan’s’ expression softens.  “Uh… breakfast should be ready in a few minutes,” he communicates.  “Anyway I just wanted to speak to you beforehand, I didn’t really want an awkward breakfast.”  

“We are fine,” you reassure him.

“I am glad.  We wouldn’t want any misunderstandings with your sis, eh?”

He gives you a last lingering look of regret and longing before he turns and disappears down the stairs.  You find yourself staring at his figure as he walks away.  There was a time, not long ago that you wanted to be Ryan, or rather as much like him as possible.  He was confident and outgoing, wildly successful and in great shape.  And he just seemed to have fun wherever he went.  He was a happy guy and it showed.  Everyone wanted a piece of that.  Only a short while earlier, you had planned to do your best to imitate him during the current semester.  Now, such an ambition was altogether impossible.

[[Go have breakfast with Julie and Ryan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="137" name="Go have breakfast with Julie and Ryan" tags="" position="12460,13495" size="100,100">You join your sister and Ryan at the table a few minutes later after washing up.

It was simple fare, toast and cereal, but delicious.  Ryan seemed unusually muted during the meal’s conversation.

“Whatcha doin’ today, Taylor?” he asks you during a lull in the conversation.

“I have some research to do...and some school stuff,” you reply vaguely.

Ryan leans forward, placing an elbow of his big arm on the table.  “What classes do you have?”  Before you can answer, he asks you another question, more directly.  “And what kind of mysterious “research” are you doing?”

He seems a little //too// interested.  Ryan definitely never had this level of interest in you before. 

[[Talk about class]]
[[Mention your research and see what he thinks]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="Talk about class" tags="" position="12603,13692" size="100,100">You decide to play it safe and talk about class.  You bore Ryan with some irrelevant details and the topic thankfully meanders away from your unusual circumstances.

After breakfast you head to class and pass another day in the clouds.  You just had so much to think about, so many ideas floating around and competing your attention.  The ideas were only half the battle.  You had discovered, to your constant dismay, that it was Ryan’s image that stubbornly kept coming up.

By the time lunch comes around you only partially distracted.  At the end of your final class you realize an awful truth: you are incredibly horny.  If you were a man you would run to a bathroom stall and jerk off quickly --at least you would get through the day.  Yet now you can’t imagine doing such a thing.  //Besides, it would take too damn long,// you lament.  As you squirm in your chair you feel your panties cling uncomfortably close to your damp pussy.

You see Evan and Drew both coming towards you.  //Oh shit!//

“This isn’t a good time guys!  I-am-not-feeling-well,” you shout to your confused friends as you dash by.

When you arrive home you feel like a bath.

[[Have a bath]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="Mention your research and see what he thinks" tags="" position="12310,13590" size="100,100">Alt route under construction.  Perhaps telling Ryan is a bit too much inforformation?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="140" name="Later that night..." tags="" position="12609,13853" size="100,100">“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” moans of passion again echoed throughout your house.
You listen to your sister’s muffled voice with horrified fascination. You listen intently, scarcely daring to even breath.
“You have been //insatiable //this past week,” your sister chides Ryan in between her gasps for breath.
//Ever since he met me? //you realize with embarrassment.  //That has to be just a super creepy coincidence.  Please, please, please, let it just be a super-creepy-coincidence!//
That uncertain feeling made you deeply uncomfortable.  After listening to the sounds of their sex doe a while, you soon find your own hands gently rubbing yourself in time with the sounds.  Much to your astonishment, your panties are already soaked through...  //This is so wrong.  I should give them some privacy before I am found out.//

You tear yourself away from the vibrating wall and try and lose yourself in a new TV series.

[[Time drifts on by]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="141" name="Time drifts on by" tags="" position="12455,13895" size="100,100">A week later your sister informs she should be working late.  “Have fun,” you say as you wave her off.  The very instant she departs, you hear a knock on your front door.  

&quot;Fuck!&quot; you curse as you appraise your state of dress...or lack thereof.  You are wearing one of your old sweaters, now so woefully oversized it functions as a comfortable, warm dress.  Your outift leaves your long legs completely exposed.

As you debate dashing and changing, the knock repeats.

For a second you think it is Julie but quickly realize she wouldn’t knock.  With a sigh, you give up on the idea of changing.  You open the door to find Ryan standing on the front step.

He grins ear to ear when he sees you...and how you are dressed.  
“Interested?” he says while holding up a kung fu dvd.

“Huh?  You want to fight?” you joke, raising your tiny fists and slender arms into a fighting stance.

Ryan appraises you for a moment with a smile.  “I’d never fight someone so fierce!” he replies.

“I am pretty fierce,” you agree.

“So...may I come in?”

“Julie isn’t here.  She just left for work,” you inform him.

“I am not here to see Julie.  I am here to see //you//, Taylor.”

Your storm of conflicting emotions returns.  Your anxiety gets multiplied a hundredfold.

You want to tell him to leave, to fuck off and leave you alone.  “Yeah, you can come in...” you find yourself whispering instead.

“Cool, this movie is going to be great! Plus I get to watch it with a total babe like you.”

[[Watch the movie with Ryan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="Watch the movie with Ryan" tags="" position="12607,13997" size="100,100">Ten minutes later you were both laughing at the movie.  It was clear from the onset that this particular film was going to be hilarious.

“That is //so// unrealistic!” you huff, while laughing at one of the ridiculous moves on screen.  The movie is pretty entertaining in a terrible sort of way.  In the grand finale, the final battle, everything is decided with a single blow.  “You can’t actually kick someone like that,” you comment with a shake of your head, forcing you to brush the hair from your eyes.  

“No, that move is totally legit,” Ryan insists as he stands up and mimes an exaggerated impression of the kick.  “See?”

“That wasn’t even close!” you object as you stand up.  It was more like,“hoo-ah!” you yell in an attempt to imitate the on screen move.  You spin around and a swing a high kick up towards Ryan’s head.  Except now you are much shorter than before and your leg only reaches his chest.  As soon as you complete your kick, you immediately regret it, for your long, bare legs are exposed to Ryan as well as your panties from beneath your oversized sweater.  Despite attacking, in that instant you felt completely vulnerable and Ryan takes advantage of your weakness by pragmatically grabbing hold of your leg, leaving you awkwardly bouncing on the other for support.

Ryan grins broadly, he seemed to be more than enjoying himself.  Ryan then moves in a bit too close for your comfort and your try and instinctively hop backwards.

You both fall together in a tangle of limbs onto the couch.  The next thing you know, your faces are nearly pressed together. As soon as you make eye contact the last vestiges of your willpower evaporates completely.  //It would be so easy to just close my eyes and….give in to my racing heart and the excitement of the moment.//

[[Close your eyes]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="Close your eyes" tags="" position="12457,14043" size="100,100">You open your eyes and find Ryan an inch away from your face.  Then, without any input on your part, your lips meet and with their touching, it instantly prompts Ryan into an all out make-out assault.  The intensity of his advance leaves you completely defenseless as you are quickly overwhelmed by his passionate kisses.  Soon your entire upper body is red and flushed and you are too disoriented to repel or return his affections.

You feel his stubble rub roughly against your cheek as you try desperately to push him away.  Yet you soon find your strength to be failing.

“Mmmm!” you moan as Ryan slips his tongue back into your mouth.  You try and push back against him with your own tongue but it has the opposite effect you were hoping for.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

//Oh my god… I am French kissing my sister’s boyfriend!// The horrified thought lingers briefly in your mind but is soon replaced with unfamiliar sensations of growing pleasure.

[[Let the experience continue]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="Let Ryan fondle you" tags="" position="12459,14190" size="100,100">While still cupping your breasts, Ryan’s other hand gradually explores your thighs, eventually coming to rest in between your legs.  Shocked, you draw away from him for a moment, looking down at your lower body and then over to Ryan’s penetrating blue eyes.  You feel yourself flush and turn away in embarrassment, catching a view of Ryan’s massive erection pitching a great tent in his pants.  You twist away just as Ryan again leans in and covers your lips and cheeks in kisses.  His tenderness and raw affection leaves you mentally spinning.  In that moment, you couldn’t really think of anything except the feeling of your body touching against Ryan&#39;s.  The whole scene seemed absolutely //surreal//.

Ryan’s hands alone were nearly driving you mad.  Especially the one present between your legs, so close to your most sensitive parts.  You feel your too-hot pussy,  just aching to be touched, like an itch just out of reach… it was //so //frustrating.  The heat and wetness from your sex was now obvious, so you begin to wonder why Ryan didn’t advance.  Why was he tormenting you?  You want him to stroke you down lower, do push just a bit deeper into your folds, yet his hand does nothing but hover excruciatingly above your aching loins.

You make eye contact again and he finally gives you what you have been yearning for.  Ryan begins to gently probe your mound, eagerly watching your reactions as he teases you.

You inhale sharply as he brushes against a sensitive spot.  At your response, Ryan stops cold until, seeing your distress and embarrassment, along with your evident desire to continue, he slowly returns his hand between your legs.

“Helllloooo?  Anyone here?  I am ~hooome!!” Julie’’s voice suddenly rings through the house.  //Oh shit!  Shit!  Shit!  My sister is back.//

[[Fuuuuuuuuck!  Panic!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="Look back at Julie" tags="" position="6587,7467" size="100,100">Her words make you uncomfortable...but not as uncomfortable as the way your sister seems to be looking at you...almost as an object of lust.  //Whoa…. This joke has gone on long enough,// you think as you try and edge slowly towards the door.  But before you can escape, Julie blocks your path.  There is something about her body language and expression that immediately sets alarm bells ringing in your head.

Suddenly Julie takes command, pulling your shirt down without shame, revealing your bare perky breasts to the room.  Perhaps it is the shock, or the sudden onset of air, but you immediately become conscious of your hard nipples.  Julie seems impressed at your breast size.  She smiles at your chest as she gives your right breast a soft, playful squeeze.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/julietaylor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“These are way too nice for Taylor,” Julie opines with a shake of her head.  “I almost might have to keep you all for myself.”

“What are you doing?” you finally manage to ask her.  Your voice comes off as shrill and desperate.

[[Try and come clean]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="Noooooooooooooooooooo" tags="" position="6587,7664" size="100,100">
A particular Katy Perry son runs through your head...

Your sister’s lips meet yours.  Her lips are soft, gentle...and unbearably warm.

“Mmmphh!  Mghh!  Mmmm…..” it frightens you how quickly your protests change to acceptance.

//Holy fuck!// you think, your mind spinning.  Your sister is a //really// good kisser.

//I guess she has had a lot of practice,// you note dryly.

Julie teases you, her sensuous lips kissing you with intimacy and urgency.

You shouldn’t be kissing another woman as a woman- that is kind of weird as is- but kissing your fucking sister?  You are beginning to think you might end up in a psychology manual one day.

//What about Julie’s boyfriend?  Fucking hell!//  You didn’t even know your sister liked girls.

Your sister pulls away, thankfully giving you a moment to breath.  You feel dizzy, your beautiful sister has stolen your breath away.

“Julie…”

Your sister ignores you, she pulls your shirt over your head with a giggle.  Your mouth falls open and your sister fills it with her invading tongue.

//This is fucking WRONG!//

“Hnngh!” you yelp as your sister withdraws, giving your breast a playful bite.  “We have to stop this right niiiiiioooooooooooowww~ ahhh.”

Your sister’s groping intensifies, her soft but firm hands roaming about, making all your most sensitive places tingle.  //I guess Julie is familiar with a body like this….Oh my god.  I just have to yell out that I am Taylor, why can’t I do it!?//  

Your sister slowly works her way back up to your lips.  She begins making out with you, again drowning out any hope of a timely explanation.  When she withdraws, you are left breathing like you just ran a marathon.  Your mind is screaming, your heart pounding, your pussy…

“Wow, you are soaked, Tammy,” Julie observes, answering your line of thought.  She withdraws a glistening finger from your underwear.
Before you can say anything Julie places the finger in her mouth and sucks it clean with an impish smile that makes you simultaneously cringe and flood with wetness.

Julie grabs your trembling hand.  “No need to be nervous,” she coos in your ear.  Julie places your hand on her breast, carefully judging your reaction.

“Oh my fucking god, Tammy, you are //soooo// cute!”
[[Continue your awkward and awesome moment with Julie]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="Fuuuuuuuuck!  Panic!" tags="" position="12611,14291" size="100,100">You panic and slide to the other side of the couch while Ryan nonchalantly sits up, straightens his shirt, and acts like nothing amiss was happening just as your sister enters the room.

You quickly use a pillow to hide the smell and sight of your soaked pussy.  //If Julie would have been any later…//  Your sister might have walked in on something horrifying.   The thought was hard to imagine and would be harder still to explain away.

“What are you two doing?” Julie asks, her eyes narrowing suspiciously at your positioning on the couch.

“Just finished a kung fu movie,” Ryan answers without missing a beat.  “I got another one, //Death from a Thousand Punches,// if you want to join us for round two,” Ryan suggests.  You know your sister hates such fare.

“Uh, pass.”  Julie sighs.  “Been a long day at work and I am exhausted.  I am going to shower and go to bed.”

“I will be up in a little bit,” Ryan assures her.  “Well, depends on how good //Thousand Punches// is.”

Julie rolls her eyes and shoots you a sympathetic look.  You shrug, finding it difficult to meet her eyes.  

“Alright, enjoy getting //punched!//” Julie says, and with that she is gone, leaving only the sound of the creaking of the staircase as goes went upstairs.  //Which leaves Ryan and I alone again,// you realize with a blush.  The heady atmosphere once dissipated, rapidly reforms.

Ryan gives you a wink as he stands and pops in the next dvd and...then proceeds to sit down directly right beside you.

You are shocked at his boldness.
“Uhh...that is a bit //close,//” you say to him, a tad alarmed.  It was awful enough with your sister at work, but just upstairs….that added a whole new level of danger...and excitement.  “She is going to catch us and we shouldn’t be doing this anyway…” you manage to say when Ryan puts a hand on your thigh.  There was a part of that line of thought that was terrifying but also simultaneously very arousing.

[[Look back at Ryan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="Look back at Ryan" tags="" position="12463,14345" size="100,100">“She won’t catch us,” Ryan asserts confidently, just as the sound of running water erupts from upstairs and rattles your house’s old plumbing.  “Julie likes like long showers, especially after work so we will have some privacy,” Ryan explains.  “I know her routine and she takes her time, sometimes doing her hair and shit too after.  Perhaps even an hour or so--beyond the shower,” he informs you, apparently throwing the possibility of some kind of tryst out there.

“Uh huh…”

His pure ballsiness and overflowing confidence mesmerize you.  You never would have had the courage to do anything similar, had the situation been reversed.  //The beautiful girl would have made me nervous….now I am the girl.//  It still didn’t seem right, but what did seem and feel right, was the intense yearning present inside you and the glowing sensation of the often remembered moment your lips first touched.

As the movie rolls on ignored in the background, you find your eyes drawn to each other, like iron to a lodestone.  Without even really thinking it over, the moment of tension explodes as Ryan shimmies forward and embraces you.  He holds you tightly for a few moments, before pushing you softly back onto the couch.  He climbs on top of you and you let him, your slender arms falling to your sides.  Ryan kisses your neck and works his way to your earlobes, which he playfully nibbles upon.  His lips peck you dozens of times as your face shifts side to side.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

[[Ryan continues kissing you]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="149" name="Endure" tags="" position="12467,14487" size="100,100">
You could not tell how long had passed since Ryan first starting kissing you.  You can just make out that the faint sound of the water still running upstairs but you feel like it has already been ages since your sister left.  The pressure inside you continues building and you can feel Ryan’s skillful caresses bringing you near your limit.  You open your bewildered eyes and try and steady your shivering body but it proves impossible as Ryan coaxes you beyond your ability to resist.  All the pressure, built up over oh so long, floods out of you in an instant as you are rocked with an intense orgasm that leaves you squirming and spasming, flopping around like a freshly caught fish yet held securely in Ryan’s strong arms while he observes from above you with blissful approval at the results of his handiwork.

You are fucking broken.  Your orgasm shakes you over and over again sending waves of pleasure permeating throughout your body and triggering secondary orgasms that leave you breathless and twitching, forcing your eyes to roll back in your head.

//Oh my fucking god….//

That was the most intense feeling you had ever felt in your life.  The //best// feeling by far.  //Like fifty male orgasms in one,// you think as your legs continue to spasm slightly as pleasurable aftershocks continued to undulate through your new body.  Women had it way better than men!  //This is awesome!//

“Taylor… are you okay?” Ryan asks, his voice sounded somewhat pained and distant.  You open your eyes and try and focus your spinning vision only to land on Ryan’s massive erection straining futilely against his pants.


[[Think about how you feel]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="150" name="Think about how you feel" tags="" position="12611,14593" size="100,100">“I am //way// better than okay,” you finally admit when you find your voice.  You barely manage to suppress a shiver, your entire body is covered in goosebumps.  You feel so good right now that it frightens you to be aware what you would do to repeat this feeling.  //Almost anything...//   You look over at Ryan’s clearly defined dick and the balance scales shift within your mind.   After all, Ryan made you feel so much pleasure, it would be very rude to leave him hanging.  You imagine if your situations were reversed his erection would be very uncomfortable.  You’ve seen dicks before, you had one not long ago too, so you rationalize it isn’t //that// big of a deal if you help him out.  And since you were familiar, there wasn’t anything really to be grossed out over, either.

You stare at Ryan’s crotch and bite your lip.

“Do you want to see it?” Ryan coyly asks you.

You blink and alternate glances between his eyes and the pitched tent.  “I…” is all you can manage to stammer in response.

“Oh my god.  You’re so cute Taylor!!” Ryan comments as he begins to unbuckle his belt.  “I will make it easy on you.”  He slides his pants and boxers down with one fluid motion and his massive erect cock bounces free.

You stare at him in open mouthed surprise.  What is he expecting you to do?  Does he want you to suck his dick?  Or maybe more…?  Your sister is just upstairs!  What the hell is he thinking?  

But your question is answered when Ryan again sits beside you, pants and underwear around his ankles, while his huge cock stands proudly at attention like a rocket ready at the launch pad.  His cock is so large it renders you speechless.  //Maybe even permanently you,// you think, imagining trying to fit that huge beast into your mouth and choking to death.  Just as you are about to call an end to the whole thing, Ryan reaches over and grabs your delicate hand and then gently moves it over and wraps it around his petrified member.

[[I can&#39;t believe this!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="151" name="I can&#39;t believe this!" tags="" position="12463,14643" size="100,100">Your tiny hand tightly grips Ryan’s shaft.  Probably too tightly, you suddenly realize.  You are so damn nervous and excited you are buzzing.  You relax your grip and attempt to calm yourself.  Jacking off is something you have had a lot of practice at but, from this perspective it just seems...//different// and admittedly kind of //wrong.//  Still, it is quite hot, no matter the perspective.

As you slowly move your hand, Ryan lets the sound of a deep, ragged breath escape his lips.  You are suddenly conscious of just how big his cock is and how hot and hard it feels on the skin of your tiny, soft hand.  Ryan’s dick was pretty marvelous.  Any man on earth would be proud to have one similar.  You are momentarily entranced by Ryan’s cock.  It was easily double the size of yours was when you were a guy.  //He is obviously very excited… because of me//, you realize with shock.  You give Ryan’s cock a few tentative pumps and he moans in obvious pleasure.

Suddenly you hear the shower upstairs cutoff.  You feel a moment of intense panic.  //If Julie comes down here and sees us like this she will go completely berserk!  We will seriously be killed!//  You sister was fairly chill most of the time but there were certain buttons that, once pressed, would send her into a legendary rage.  You had half a dozen small scars and piles of once valuable items reduced to ashes and debris to use as evidence for the argument to not press those buttons. 

Ryan, lost in pleasure, apparently doesn’t notice or care.  Your sister could appear at any moment.  You have to finish and cover up as soon as possible.  //I either make him cum quick or get the fuck out of here….//  Those seemed to be your options. //Shit!//  Every second counts, so you had to act while had an opportunity.  //It’s do or die!  Err, cum or die!//

[[Complete your mission]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="152" name="Complete your mission" tags="" position="12611,14752" size="100,100">You decide to start stroking Ryan faster.  One of your tiny hands glides up and down his pole, using his own overflowing precum to speed your movements, while the other rubs your clit in circular motions.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hj3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;896px&quot; height=&quot;672px&quot;&gt;
Time was of the absolute essence, so you stroke Ryan with the impetus and skill of a professional whore, for you had once been a teenage boy, a fapping veteran spilling seed during his prime.  Now you put that skill to use in your moment of need. 

 “Ohh jesus Taylor your hand feels so good….uhh uhh...oh god… fuck!  Uhhhhh!  Wow!  Holy jesus!  I am coming!” he announces.  //Oh my god ...so am I!// you realize at the same time.

You both cum at about the same moment, a wave of pleasurable warmth washing over you just as Ryan’s cock bulges and ejaculates all over your hand and his own pubic area with several big splashes of thick, white cum.  

You are shocked at the sheer volume of his explosion, your cupped hand is now full of his sticky white semen.  Its pungent, slightly fishy smell touches your nostrils and you inhale the somewhat unfamiliar scent.  //I guess he was excited and we did stop earlier….// You marvel at your accomplishment.  You were well aware of how uncomfortable that must have been for him.

[[Enjoy the afterglow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="153" name="Enjoy the afterglow" tags="" position="12465,14790" size="100,100">You both just sit there, unmoving but for your heavy breathing, enjoying the momentary afterglows of your orgasms.

“I didn’t think you were that experienced,” Ryan comments in amazement at your apparent skill.

“I am not that experienced!” you object.  “Well...just hand jobs I guess…”

“You like handjobs?  I do too,” Ryan laughs with a content smile and heavy lidded-eyes.

A moment later you become more clear headed and realize your sister could appear at any moment.  That and you have a handful of your sister’s boyfriend’s cum.  //Ahhhhhhhh!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumhand.jpg&quot; width=&quot;968px&quot; height=&quot;1296px&quot;&gt;

[[Creeeeeaaaaaaaack]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="154" name="The next morning" tags="" position="12461,14948" size="100,100">The next morning the three of you again meet over the breakfast table.  You and Ryan exchange knowing looks with each other as you sit down.  He gives you a sly smile.

“Good morning Tay!” your sister says as she plops down a plate of waffles in front of you for breakfast.

“These smell delicious.”

“They taste delicious too,” Ryan adds.  “Just one of your cousin’s //many// talents.”

//Yep cooking and slut stuff, she is a real pro at those two things...//  You slap the oddly jealous thoughts away.

You take a big syrup covered bite of waffle and revel in its glorious, fluffy texture.

“Mmmmm!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/waffle.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Just as you prepare to eat another mouthful, you feel Ryan’s foot brush up against yours.

“Mmm!” you let out a surprised muffled noise, hoping it sounds like your earlier enjoyment of the top class waffles.  Ryan’s touch definitely woke you up completely in a single instant.  You soon forget about the waffles completely.

[[Play footsie with Ryan]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="Head to Evan&#39;s room" tags="" position="2352,12049" size="100,100">Evan greets you with a wave.  “Taylor!  What took so long?”

“Doesn’t matter.  What did you find?”

“I will show you.  Follow me!”  Evan leads you to the basement.  “Check it out!” Evan says enthusiastically as he tosses two bundles down on a folding table.  One object is about the size of a toolbox, the other appears to be a simple envelope.

“Huh?”

“Test kits!” Evan elaborates.  “For your researching your condition.”

“Cool!”

“The big one is kinda old and I think some of the things inside might be a bit expired but I am sure it is fine.  We should be able to do some basic lab work and get results quick.”

“And the other?”

“Is a full lab workup, super accurate and expensive.  It is also anonymous too, I checked.  You send it off express and you get emailed results.”

“Oh, neat.”

“The send off will probably give way more worthwhile information.”

“I don’t know if I can afford the good one.”

“Already prepaid by dad’s practice.  They use it for certain things they want done quickly.”

“I see, thanks a bunch Evan, this is great!”  You feel a bit awkward taking advantage of Evan&#39;s generostiy but you decide to:
[[Use the home kit]]
[[Use the send away kit]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="156" name="Use the home kit" tags="" position="2500,12091" size="100,100">You decide to use the home kit, since it is already there in front of you.  You take a saliva sample and a few pricks of blood, rubbing them on the provided test sheets in the areas that are chemically activated.  After an hour, you have completed most of them.

“Wow,” you say in stunned disbelief, as you look over the unremarkable results.  //What a fucking waste of time!//  You have learned only two things of essentially trivial importance.  The tests confirm you have high estrogen but otherwise healthy levels of female hormones.  You were expecting that.  The other discovery, however, you were not.  Your blood type had changed.  You used to be AB, now your very blood seems to having morphed into that of a universal donor.  //An O negative girl//.  At least you were O positive where it counts.  You recall hearing about how difficult it is for some women to achieve orgasm, and you are glad you don’t fall into that camp. 

//And hey, maybe I can save a few lives by going to the blood bank, neat!//

“That’s so weird,” you say, mystified over the bloody revelation.

“Why?  If you can transform into a chick, can’t your blood change too?”

“Apparently.”

“Sorry, it seems kinda like a bust,” Evan apologizes but you give him a comforting smile. 

“Not, your fault.  Progress!” you say as you follow Evan back upstairs to his room.

The moment you two are alone in Evan’s room you feel the atmosphere change.

You two look at each other and you notice Evan take a deep breath, as if working up his courage to ask you something.

You shake your head in disbelief.  “NO!” you yell preemptively in an attempt to forestall Evan&#39;s inevitable idiotic rationalizations.
Evan opens his mouth but you refuse to let him pollute you with his stupidity.

[[Explain you&#39;ve had enough]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="Use the send away kit" tags="" position="2206,12094" size="100,100">under construction</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="Explain you&#39;ve had enough" tags="" position="2353,12201" size="100,100">“Evan I want you to stop pushing me.  I am not doing anymore weird shit with you.  The end!”

“Hey-- don’t be that way.  I had one of the greatest nights of my life, you can’t really blame me for desiring a repeat, can you?”

“I get it.  I don’t blame you.  I am just //done// with all this stuff.  Okay?”

“Uh huh…” Evan doesn’t seem convinced.

“Hey I am not just asking you to blow me for free.  I will do you too, that way we are even!”

“What do you mean by, “do me too”?” As soon as the words leave your lips, you already have your answer as Evan slowly sinks between your legs with an evil glint in his eye.

“Whoa!  Whoa!  Stop right there!  What in the fuck do you think you are doing?” you shriek at him just as his hands grasp around your belt.

“I am going to eat your pussy out and make you cum a bunch,” he declares.  “Well...if you let me of course.”

“W-what!?”

“To you pay you back for everything you have done for me.  You suck my dick; I’ll suck yours.”

“I don’t have a…”

“I know!  That isn’t the point.  It is an //expression.//  Aren’t you a bit curious?  Have you had oral sex as a woman before?”

“No, of course not…”

“Well how can you not want to try?  Where’s your adventurous spirit?  Is Taylor-Fucking-Roux dead?  I think not!  I bet it feels fucking awesome to be eaten out!  Now, here’s your chance,” Evan concludes his argument like a high paid attorney.

You sigh.  Why do you bother listening to this guy at all?  You should consider wearing earplugs around Evan.  He seems to be quite good at convincing you to do shit you don’t want.  Yet now his current offer is quite a bit different.  Instead of giving pleasure, this was an opportunity to //receive//...and maybe have a new experience in the process.

[[Let Evan give you oral sex]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="159" name="Let Evan give you oral sex" tags="" position="2496,12243" size="100,100">“Well, get to work then, bitch,” you leer at Evan.

You undo your belt buckle and the top button of your pants and as soon you do, Evan rips the pants right off you, leaving your pussy exposed--protected only by the thin strip of fabric of your panties.  

Evan takes a deep breath, inhaling like a man about to dive under the ice for several minutes for some stupid tradition in Russia.
You find his eagerness to be a turn on.  You can feel a wonderful tingle emanating from your pubic area in anticipation.  Evan pulls your panties aside and you immediately feel exposed and awkward.  Evan stares directly at your inviting pussy like it is the holy grail. 

//Maybe this isn’t such an even transaction...he is enjoying this a little too damn much!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanoral.jpg&quot; width=&quot;960px&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
Evan proceeds to “dive” into you, burying his nose, lips, and wagging tongue into your love canal.
Your eyes go wide and nearly pop out of your skull in response to sensation.  //Holllllllyyyyyyyyyyy…….fuck.//  This was definitely new territory.

“This might not be so bad after---uhhhh---all...That feels really good right there...uhhhnn!” Following your reactions, Evan gradually refines his movements.  Soon your entire crotch is sodden with your love juices and the saliva of your best friend.

Evan works like a champ, doing his best to please you.  He licks and tickles you, sucking and probing you until you find yourself slightly humping his face just to get his tongue a //little bit// deeper inside you.

[[Ride Evan&#39;s face]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="160" name="Ride Evan&#39;s face" tags="" position="2353,12347" size="100,100">You feel so fucking good right now.  //Too// fucking good.  You are beginning to fear you might lose your sanity.

“Ohhhh wow...E-Evan!  O-okay!  You were right this is ah-ah-awesome!”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanoral2.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Your words seem to light a fire under Evan to make you cum and push you over the edge of the precipice into oblivion.
His efforts redouble and soon you are moaning loudly in pleasure, not giving a fuck if Evan’s roommates hear you.  By this point you only care about releasing the all-consuming desires within you.

Evan then does something that sends lightning bolts of pleasure arcing through every fiber of your being.  He finally settles on the top of your pussy...upon your //clittoris//.  The little bud is so sensitive that when Evan’s tongue probes beneath its delicate, sweet hood your hips inadvertently jolt away.

Evan chuckles at your reaction, pleased at his discovery.  He then takes another Russian diver breath and power dives back into your womanhood.  He licks at your clit, driving you absolutely wild.  Your yelps and squeals ring around you as squirm under Evan’s tongue.  Evan comes up red faced and breathing hard but you forbid him a breather and grab Evan’s head and mash his face back into your pussy where it fucking belongs.  You feel your juices flowing profusely, and are embarrassed when you see how much you have soaked the bed sheet.  Evan then forms an O with his lips and wraps them around your little clit. Being surrounded by the warm flesh feels great, and when Evan adds his tongue into the fray he had clearly won this sexual battle.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  EVAN!  FUCK!  Oooooohhhh mmmmyyyyy gooooddddddd,” your moans echo throughout the room, and no doubt the entire house as you cum over and over again on your friend&#39;s face.

[[Feel the after-effects]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="Feel the after-effects" tags="" position="2492,12397" size="100,100">As a man you would often fall asleep after an orgasm...yet now, as a woman, you feel yourself revving up instead of climaxing and crashing.  You are wide awake….and super horny and warm, despite just having a great orgasm.

Evan’s boner couldn’t be more obvious.  You frown at it, wondering if this was Evan’s plan all along.  //Nah, Evan’s not exactly a forward thinking kind of guy!//

Your mood and disposition had definitely improved with the experience of one of the most intense orgasms of your life.  //No… it wasn’t just not one of...that orgasm stood clearly apart from the rest. // Evan had proven he could make you feel //really// good if he had the desire.
Your vision lands on Evan’s crotch and you feel the last vestiges of your inhibitions evaporate.
After all that pleasure you had just received, how can you not help out your friend and return the favour?  Without bidding, you sink to your knees in front of your best friend

Guessing your intent, Evan suddenly offer you a suggestion.  “You might as well get naked while you blow me, how hot would that be?”
It would be hot, if you didn’t have to be the one to do it.
Still, you’re already bottomless and burning, you can feel your juices running down your leg.  It is also true that Evan has already seen every inch of you anyway.  You throw your shirt away and unhook your bra, baring your breasts to the delight of your friend.

Naked, sweaty, and glowing, but also eager to please, you set to work on repaying Evan’s kindness.  You want to make Evan feel exactly like you just did...or as close to it as a male possibly could.  //It won’t be close...but I can still try.//  After all, if Evan wouldn’t have talked you into that oral, perhaps you never would have experienced anything like it in your entire lifetime.

[[Suck Evan off]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="Suck Evan off" tags="" position="2356,12494" size="100,100">You begin to vigorously suck Evan’s dick and, to your surprise, you find youself likinh it.

//This is actually kind of fun!// you think as your tongue runs up and down Evan’s shaft.  Who would have thought you would one day suck a dick and enjoy it?  It is a bit sad in a way but you actually find a passive pleasure in pleasing someone else.  //It isn’t so bad...// you think as your tongue swirls around Evan’s cockhead. 

“Oh Taylor!” Evan howls as you take half his length in your mouth and gag.  //It could be worse...//  And Evan seems to love it too, that is something, isn’t it?


 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evansuck2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You choose to take Evan’s shaft in hand and lick all the way from his balls all the way to the tip of his glans, lapping up Evan’s salty precum on the way.  You then can’t help yourself as you impale your own head on Evan’s dick, in an attempt to get as much of him as possible inside you.  Evan’s large cock hits the back of your throat and you nearly gag.  With each subsequent attempt, [[you manage to get him slightly deeper down your throat.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="Clean up and leave" tags="" position="2360,12648" size="100,100">The next day, Evan volunteers to help you do research.  You don’t have class until noon so you invite Evan over in the morning.  Evan instantly agrees.  It is obvious he has some ulterior plans, but you still felt you could use the company.  Evan had a way of making you feel better when you were down.

Once Evan arrives, you try and study for class and search for possible transformation causes.

You try and concentrate on the task at hand, but it isn’t long before you find one of Evan’s in your pants.

“You’re not going to leave me alone, are you?” you ask Evan angrily.
“No!  Not when I am like //this.//  C’mon Tay, I am //dying// here,” Evan says as he presents his meaty boner to you.  You stare wide-eyed at your friend’s huge dick.

“Don’t just whip it out, you fucking lecher!  Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?  That is not a normal thing to do!”

“But--”

“Just shut up.  Shut.  The.  Fuck.  Up.  You have convinced me already.  I don’t want to hear any more of your bullshit.”

A huge grin splits Evan’s face.  “So…?”

“Yeah, you’re obviously not going to stop pawing at me until you get off and transform back into a normal person.  Come here and I will suck you off before class.”

“Oh my god Taylor that sounds //so hot.//”

You have set the course in motion: Evan’s dick and your mouth inevitably collide.
[[Suck Evan off.....again]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="Let your friend&#39;s semen drip off you" tags="" position="2352,12793" size="100,100">You find the white mess coating your face to be less disgusting than you once would have.  It is almost sort of sexy in a way.  Evan seems to agree, indicated by his eager stares.

You stand and are about to head to the bathroom when Evan stops you.  

“Wait Taylor before you go I need your help with one more thing.”
You immediately fight off a recollection of horrible events that once began with a similar speech.

“What do you want?” you demand.

With every lewd act, the next one becomes progressively more difficult to turn down.  You are certain his request will be something fucked up, that or a joke...or maybe a //fucked up joke//?

“Can I take a pic of you now?” Evan innocently asks you.

“Hah!  Fuck no!” you respond without missing a beat.  After a second, it dawns on you Evan is actually serious.  //Of course he is--Evan is a fucking moron!//

“Oh come on!  Put yourself in my shoes,&quot; Evan pleads.  &quot;We’ve been friends forever, so just trust me a little bit.  I have earned that from you, haven’t I?  I promise I won’t show anyone.  I just want to remember giving out such a beautiful facial to such a monumental babe.  This will just be a personal memento, I swear to the almighty Flying Spaghetti Monster!”

You cannot help but sigh.  “I used to think facials were hot too,” you admit.

“Because they are!  And if you ever want another one, call me //anytime--day or night// and I will be there in a flash!”

“As if...you’re not some blowjob superhero, sorry to inform you.”  You begin to wipe Evan’s semen off your face but stop yourself when Evan takes out his cellphone and looks directly at you with an expression you find unusually difficult to read.

“//Please, //Taylor,” he presses you.

“Big difference between fantasizing about unloading on a girl’s face and being the one on your knees,” you say.  “And don’t beg, it is fucking pathetic, no girl--or guy likes a fucking pussy.”

“Exactly why I want a picture!  This is a dream come true.  You’re so fucking hot right now, you can’t blame me for wanting a little piece for posterity… I will even send them to you one day so you got a memento once you change back.”  You groan at the idea, briefly imagining the weirdness of selfcest or masturbating as a guy to a picture of you as a girl with your best friend’s cum on your face.  //Fucking hell!//

[[Listen to Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="165" name="Listen to Evan" tags="" position="2500,12845" size="100,100">Evan keeps droning on in the void of your silence.  “And besides we have already done the naughty stuff, no reason to be embarrassed now,” he insists.

“I am not embarrassed!”  You sigh again.  “You’re such an idiot sometimes, Evan.”  Evan smiles at you when he realizes he has made progress wearing you down.

“It’s not a big deal,” Evan continues.  While you disagree, you cannot help but admit that your anxiety so far has been largely unwarranted. 

Sex was a completely natural and fun act and it felt //amazing//, especially from your new perspective.  There was no sense denying your urges and fighting against biology.  //We have already gone this far,// you think.  You try and imagine the scenario from Evan’s point of view and, while you understand his urges, you can’t quite reconcile his decisions in your mind.  //Uhhh….what should I do? //You wonder as Evan points his cellphone at you.

Since you are already covered you find it a bit hard to turn your friend down.  Every second is just prolonging your facial.

//Well the cows have already left the barn.  No point closing the door now….//

You turn and face Evan, staring straight into the camera while giving an excellent view of Evan’s white seed that is still covering your face.

The camera flashes and instantly a strange feeling, an exhibitionist allure seizes hold of you.   Seconds pass and Evan’s cellphone has not moved.  As he stands looming above you, you smile at him and the [[camera suddenly flashes again.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="166" name="Go to class with Evan" tags="" position="2498,12992" size="100,100">You head to class with Evan after washing up.  By the time you arrive at campus you feel a pain in your stomach and you head to the bathroom praying it is just gas and not another freakish transformation seizing hold of you.

(Outside the washroom, in the atrium)

Drew edges nervously towards Evan.  “Hey Evan, can I talk you for a second?” he says.

“About?” Evan’s terse reply sounds cold.

“Taylor.  You two have been kind of extra weird lately.  Taylor hasn’t returned my messages.  Did something happen?  Is she mad at me?” Drew asks Evan.

“None of your business,” Evan responds.

“But we used to…”

“Hey Drew, Taylor and I are busy, so can you please fuck off in general?”

“You are being mean to her!  I can see tha!  Don’t take advantage of your friends!”
“I am not.  Piss off, Drew.  It&#39;s none of your damn business.”

“You’re taking advantage of her,” Drew stubbornly repeats himself.  “Or trying to.  You better not do anything weird or perverted to her,” the portly Drew warns the much taller and more athletic Evan.

“Ha!  You’re too late,” Evan informs Drew with a laugh.  “Dude, Taylor comes to //me//,” he says.  “Not the other way around.  I am not doing shit.  She is free to do whatever she wants.  The truth is she picked me instead of you, so you’d better fucking get over it.”

“W-what?” Drew stutters.  “She--you-- What do you mean?” Drew wails the questions, clearly distressed.

Evan overtly looks up and down Drew’s large belly and dishevelled clothes marred with not one, but two separate mustard stains.  

“Everyone has urges and it is not a huge surprise she doesn’t want to satisfy them with you--if you are even capable, you big fatass.  I am hot and Taylor’s hot, not really a surprise how things worked out, is it?  You’re smart- it is called //the way of the fucking world.//”
In response to Evan’s words, Drew looks crushed, like Evan had just removed and stomped on his soul.  Yet Drew refuses to completely back down, although tears begin to well in his eyes.  

“I don’t believe you,” Drew manages to stubbornly reply when his composure finally returns.  Drew seems highly agitated and begins nervously adjusting and polishing his glasses in some kind of weird OCD loop.

Evan laughs again and repositions himself to Drew’s right.  Evan pulls out his cell phone, taps it a few times, and then [[turns the screen towards Drew.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="You return from the washroom" tags="" position="2504,13148" size="100,100">You return from the washroom just in time to see Drew leave.  //That is weird,// you note.

“Are you okay?” Evan asks you.

You feign outrage and scowl at Evan.  “Girls poop too, you fucking weirdo.”

Evan chuckles.  “They sure do.  Behind every cute girl is a cute butthole,” Evan remarks.

“Uh...k.  //Anyway,// so Drew left?  Did he go home?”

“Yeah, he said he wasn’t feeling well.  We got the whole day to ourselves,” Evan answers with a smile.

You are a bit disappointed for you had hoped Drew could moderate Evan and balance out a little of the awkwardness that seems to follow you aroundlike a stormcloud lately.  

A bit later you text Drew but he doesn’t respond.  You think he has been acting a bit odd lately and being unusually distant.  Normally he responds to texts very promptly.  You aren’t quite so prompt, often taking weeks or months for the few messages you do send.  Still, Drew is a pretty consistent fellow and you can’t help but feel a little bit worried about him.

Evan sees you holding your phone and motions for you to join him.
“Any plans?” he asks you, although you feel there is a deeper question underneath his words.

“Uh, no, not at the moment.”
“My place or yours?” he asks you.

After a moment you decide you would be more comfortable at your own house.

Your day ends in the same way it had fairly often as of late:
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocklick3.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Once Evan cums and fingers you to completion he departs.

[[So this is my life now...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="So this is my life now..." tags="" position="2348,13238" size="100,100">A couple of days later you find yourself in Evan’s room.  You play a soccer game for a bit and have a decent time, but yet it isn’t long before he is pestering you for favours like usual.  You hadn’t resisted his advances in what seemed like ages, but now that Evan was attempting to push the line you decided you were going to make damn sure it didn’t budge.

“What’s the big deal?” Evan questions.  “You&#39;ve already gave me several handjobs and you’ve sucked my dick too.  I’ve even covered your face in my cum several times,” he points out, as if this somehow earns him credit.

“Uhhh...yeah...but…this is different!  And you fucking know it!”  Putting something //inside// you?  That was just such a weird, foreign concept.  You had played with your pussy and it barely accepted one of your slender fingers, let alone such a big fucking cock.   //Evan’s cock.//

You know that if you have sex with Evan it would be an abandonment of much of yourself.  A few weeks ago you were a proud, happy man...yet now you feel like something else entirely.  You wouldn’t even consider having sex with Evan as a man...but now, as a woman, the thought has you burning with arousal despite your subconscious’ howling efforts to tamp such feelings down.

“Us fucking is just the natural next step,” Evan continues to sell, using his signature brand of moronic logic that hurts your brain to even listen to.  “At least an orgasm each is a daily need, Taylor,” he goes on.  “It is almost like a right in many ways.  This is no time to be all uptight and sad.  Now that you’re a girl, we have each other.  It is just //life,//” he dumbly explains, while placing a hand between your legs.  He strokes you and the sudden feeling causes you to jump.  “See, look how wet you are,” Evan laughs as his fingers probe behind your panties.  I am hard and you are wet… seems like a match made in heaven, if you ask me.”

[[Try and rationalize with him]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="169" name="Try and rationalize with him" tags="" position="2504,13291" size="100,100">“Evan seriously.  Take a deep breath and think this through.  Everything is already fucked up enough as it is without making it more fucked...by fucking me.”

“I have thought this through,” he answers.  “Truthfully, I haven&#39;t thought of anything else. Until we fuck like rabbits, dusk until dawn, I won’t be happy and I don’t think you be will either.  You have to have sex with me.”

“I //have// to!?”

“Well if you want to, that is, geez--but there is truly no downside and no good reason to say no.  So what do you say, Taylor?  Are you interested or not?” he prompts you.  “Remember: don’t be a wussy, share the pussy!”

“I could get laid anytime like this!” you counter.  “And what’s with the fucking stupid rhymes?”

That particular point seems to discourage him.  “That’s true but...hey, girls love rhymes.”

“I am not a fucking girl!” you scream.

“You’re right… you’re more like a model, a goddess of a woman.  Looking like that, you can have any guy you want...but I don’t think you want to search for guys.  We should focus on getting you fixed…right?  And, in the meantime… I think //real// friends should help each other out during their times of need.  The ball is in your side of the court, Taylor.  I know it isn’t quite the same but come on.  Throw your buddy a bone.  //Please!//  Don’t make me beg.  I will if I have to though!  I will crawl around like a slug on my belly for the rest of my life if it would make you sleep with me.  Remember that time you got drunk and fell asleep in Craig’s van?  You ended up halfway across the damned country by the time you woke up!  And I still came and picked you up.  Had to drive all fucking day…” 

“This is ridiculous.  Won’t it like... fuck up our friendship?”

Evan answers immediately.  “No way!  It will make it //better.//  How can you not see that things are perfect now, they are better than before even, at least it could be.  How can you not see this is an obvious win-win for us both?  So...C’mon, please?”

What he was saying was at least somewhat true.  Evan was a good guy most of the time.  He was also a loyal friend...except when he seemed be keeping a constant tally of favours owed.  You know that should you somehow get coaxed into this act, you will probably have difficulty fighting the escalations any further.  What the heck would happen to you if you end up sleeping with Evan every night?  You would definitely lose any vestiges of your old self if you did that for too long.  You might even up //dating// Evan--a seriously bizarre proposition to even consider.  You’re just horny.  It’s a bad idea.  Dozens of conflicting thoughts battle in your head.  //I can’t believe I am even considering this!//  At the very least should you accept this terrible idea, it would build up a lot of credit between the two of you.  You would definitely have Evan wrapped around your little finger.

You take a big breath and make the obvious decision:

[[Let Evan have his way]]
[[Tell him there are some lines that cannot be crossed]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="Let Evan have his way" tags="" position="2352,13397" size="100,100">Maybe your transformation gave you brain damage, but you are suddenly too tired and too horny to protest.

“You owe me.  //For life!//” you tell your friend as you strip down in front of him.  He eyes you like a dog would a big juicy steak.

To limit the weirdness, you decide to face away from Evan.  You slide your panties off and lie stomach down on Evan’s bed, facing your butt towards him.

You hear Evan disrobing and find he is naked and standing behind you in a flash.  His eagerness surprises you but also turns you on.

You feel Evan’s hands run along the back of your legs.  His sudden touch makes you squeak in surprise and you can’t help but inadvertently shift and wiggle your butt in the process.

Evan relishes the sight.  Soon Evan’s hands are gripping your ass cheeks, massaging them with a lot of force like one would knead a loaf of bread.

//Holy fuck this was a bad idea!// you think, aware there is now no chance of prying Evan off you.  Not without a crowbar or having sex at least.

You look back and your eyes land on Evan’s petrified member as he positions himself between your legs.

“Evan...I uh… uh...I think we should sto--ohhh!”

You feel something press against your moist entrance.  It feels a lot bigger than a finger.  //Uh oh...//

“It’s okay right?” Evan asks you, finally acknowledging your protests and giving you a final chance to back out.  He rubs the head of his penis on the outside of your vagina but withdraws, jerking off just an inch away from your entrance while he waits for your approval.

In that moment you feel completely torn.  You know you should leave immediately and yet here you are, presenting your new pussy to your best friend, //again.//  You have already come so far...turning back now would be a nightmare.  You crane your neck and see Evan’s fully engorged cock now poking at you, the bulbous head straining longingly for release.  If you stopped now you could only imagine the level of blue balls you would leave Evan with.  It would be painful.  At the very least you might have to get him off with other means.  It actually took a lot of effort to perform any kind of service.  Even a handjob would leave your frail wrists sore the next day.  A sore jaw and gross tasting cum wasn’t a much better prospect in your mind either.  And maybe having actual intercourse would be a way to kill two birds with one stone.

You sigh as you appraise Evan.  He looks like a horse pressing at the gates before a race.  Evan is a dog with a bone.

[[Lose your virginity to Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="171" name="Tell him there are some lines that cannot be crossed" tags="" position="2648,13391" size="100,100">under construction</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="Lose your virginity to Evan" tags="" position="2508,13438" size="100,100"> “Huh…” you exhale, finding the will to fight leaving your body.  You look once more at Evan’s stupidly eager face, like a child on Christmas Eve, waiting wild eyed for the present’s of the morrow.  //Except I am the fucking present!// you internally rage, feeling more than a tad objectified.  Still, you are burning up right now.  “It’s okay,” you finally say submitting to your best friend.  Your relationship was going to take upon a new level of perverted dynamics.  “I don&#39;t care anymore.  Just do what you fucking want.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanprefuck.JPG&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot;&gt;
“You’re the fucking best Taylor!” Evan shouts enthusiastically as he penetrates deep inside you with a single, piercing thrust, devoid of any foreplay or prior warning.

“Hnnnnnggggghhh!  Owww!  Fuck!   Don’t just fucking stab me you asshole!” you cry as pain radiates through your lower body.  You feel like you have been literally torn open.  You now have Evan-a man- inside you.  The situation is so surreal you are left speechless.  In a bloody painful instant your hymen is obliterated to accommodate Evan’s girth.

“S-sorry, I will go slower,” Evan apologizes, moderating his thrusts to more shallow variations.  You find the movement and looking backwards is hurting your neck so you gradually find yourself facing forward, away from Evan, giving you a good view of the sport posters on his wall while he penetrates your pussy.  You momentarily try and space out but the huge cock ravishing your insides is impossible to ignore.

[[Keep fucking]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="Keep fucking" tags="" position="2352,13548" size="100,100">Evan continues to mercilessly fuck you from behind.  You try not to make a sound but that soon proves impossible.  You bite your lip and tremble, letting loose an occasional whimper that only seems to encourage Evan to fuck you even harder.  A part of you is glad you don’t have to look him in the eye while he does his business.  You soon feel your face become flushed.  Your whole body is warm and tingling.  Over time, the pain inside your vagina lessens and you feel Evan establish a rhythm, gliding deeper into your increasingly wet sex with ease.
You suddenly realize you are enjoying this way more than you could have imagined.  //Ugh, why does something so bad feel so good?//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evanbedroom.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

//Fap.  Fap.  Fap,// the sounds of your intercourse becomes louder and more lewd, soon echoing throughout the room.  //Fuck I can’t believe this is really happening!  I am having sex as a woman and it feels so fucking good!//  Your body naturally hugs your friend’s dick, your sensitive, wet internals being moulded by his manly, thrusting shape.

“Ohhh you’re so tight!  Your pussy is the greatest, Taylor!” Evan compliments you and you inwardly cringe.  He suddenly grabs your hair and thrusts deep inside you.  You feel your pelvic muscles flex as Evan buries himself to his limit inside you.  You can&#39;t help but cum on your friend&#39;s cock.  Evan then leans forward and deeply inhales your scent.  After creepily sniffing you, Evan plants a kiss on the top of your head and you don&#39;t say a fucking word. Your mind and body is in absolute chaos. Evan then resumes his thrusts and continues to fuck you even faster, his phallus surging in and out your dripping, wet hole at a blistering pace.
[[You feel a building pressure deep within you...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="Continue your passionate night with Evan" tags="" position="2352,13699" size="100,100">Evan chuckles at your twitching legs and behind.  “What a beautiful sight, Taylor,” your friend comments.

You ignore him, struggling to regain your breath even though you have barely moved.

Evan seems to sense your predicament and begins to anticipate your needs.  With surprising ease, Evan grabs you by your hips and pulls you up into crawling position.  With that, he proceeds to rail you doggy style for an hour and a half until you are an incoherent mess.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evandoggy.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Just when you feel like your new genitals were about to become damaged, Evan picks you up like a weightless doll and forces you to ride him.  After a flurry of ball-slapping thrusts, he finally slows, giving you five of his last great pumps as he fucks you as deep as he can.  Evan’s cock disappears inside you and your pubes mash together with his.  From deep inside you, from millions of nerve endings, you feel Evan reach his reproductive conclusion, ejactulating so deep into your pussy you are certain you feel Evan&#39;s cum splash the back of your uterus.

You have been well and truly fucked by your best friend.  //Fuck my life...//

[[Wake up the morning after]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="Wake up the morning after" tags="" position="2509,13748" size="100,100">You wake up naked in an unfamiliar bed.  Your entire body aches with a pronounced soreness in your legs, arms, and...//pussy//..  “Ow… what happened?” you wonder as you try and get your bearings. You are in Evan’s room and you now see Evan himself is lying naked beside you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminpuss.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You groan as you rub the outside of your sore pussy.  You can feel the remnants of Evan’s load coating your outer lips.

[[With mixed emotions, you recall the events of the previous night.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="Wait" tags="" position="3945,4543" size="100,100">//Click.  Creeeeeeek.//  You hear the stall door open behind you.  A pair of rough hands pull you to your feet and you twist to see who it is, only to lose your balance and awkwardly fall into the solid chest of the visitor, a large man now standing in front of you.  A drunken giggle escapes from your lips as you steady yourself by bracing yourself against him.  Your whole world is spinning and you struggle to hold on to the man for you fear if you fall you might not be able to stand up again.  Your head suddenly feels like it weighs a hundred pounds.  With surprising effort, you steady yourself and look up only to see Mitch’s grinning face down at yours.

//Oh no!// you think in a moment of absolute panic as his lips cover your own and his arbs grab you so tightly that you know that you could never get away.  He holds you there in his strong, muscular arms for an excruciatingly long time, pinning you helplessness in position while his mouth explored yours.

You try and struggle but to no avail and soon find yourself offering less resistance to Mitch’s advances. //This is wrong!  This is fucking bad//, every fiber of you knew you were in great danger but yet your new, very intoxicated body was powerless to respond.  

Mitch finally withdraws his mouth when you both suddenly hear footsteps approaching.  You try and use the moment to step by him but Mitch just laughs as he pushes you forward and helps you down on the toilet, closing the bathroom stall door shut behind you.

You are now sitting on the toilet seat with Mitch towering above you.  A tiny part of you was glad to be drunk, for otherwise you would be terrified beyond words.
[[Try and snap out of it]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="Watch TV" tags="" position="5138,8458" size="100,100">You start watching some stupid humorous cartoon show just as Drew returns.  He approves of your choice of show and sits down beside you.  He seems a lot more calm than a few minutes earlier.  He gives you a dopey smile as you watch the show together.  

It isn’t the greatest episode but it evokes several laughs from the both of you.  You end up having a pretty good time.

Suddenly you feel a noticeable pressure from below.  You have to pee, so head to the washroom during a commercial break.  “I’ll be right back,” you inform Drew as you slip into the hallway.
“I still haven’t quite gotten used to this,” you say with a sigh as you sit down, slide off your panties and relieve yourself.

While urinating, you glance over at the waste bin filled with wadded kleenex and toilet paper. //Oh, sick//… you think, trying hard not to imagine how many of those wads were produced in your name.  //I REALLY hope he just had a cold.//

You finish your businesss, dab your vagina lightly with a piece of toilet paper, and then stand up and begin fixing yourself in the mirror.  You find your underwear digs into your ass if you don’t adjust it correctly so you spend several moments adjusting it.  //It sucks having a constant wedgie,// you note.

“Hmm…”

You find yourself drawn back to the waste basket and its strange, menacing aura.  A small voice in your mind tells you that it would just take a second to be sure.  //Wait,// you stop yourself.  //Be sure of what?  Just what am I thinking of doing?  Sniffing Drew’s trash?  That is fucking disgusting!//  Still there is one wad near the top that looks like it was just deposited there recently.  //Was that from…?  Oh my fucking god,// you think as you tentatively pick it up, immediately grossed out by the immense weight of the object.  With a trembling finger, you open it up and are immediately assaulted by the strong and undeniable scent of semen.  A LOT of semen.   It was like a diaper of cum.  //Drew’s cum.//  And you are holding it in your hand.  //What.  The.  Fuck.//


&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-953.jpg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;

“Ew!” you hiss, throwing your hands in the air and knocking a bunch of clutter off the bathroom vanity.  You instinctively drop the foul object back to the wastebasket where it hits the rim and lands on the floor with a noise somewhere between a plop and a thud.

[[EW!  Fucking sick!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="EW!  Fucking sick!" tags="" position="5294,8555" size="100,100">“Taylor, you alright?” Drew calls you through the door.

Suddenly there are two rapid knocks and Drew opens the bathroom door a crack, then, upon realizing you are decent, he barges in completely.  “Are you oka--” he asks you but his voice cuts off as his eyes shoot to the tissue wad on the floor and then back up to you.  You are just now looking at your hands, but what bothers you is not how small, and feminine they appear, but the fact that they are covered with glistening strands of cum.  It looks like you had just masturbated into your own hand, only now your hand was much smaller.  //And this isn’t my cum!!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh//


&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-961.jpg&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

“I---” Drew starts to panic.  He dashes forward. “Can explain!” he  wails at you as he scrambles to pick up the wad.  You shriek at him to stay back but it is already too late: your large friend is already in motion.  He manages to pick up the wad and then stumbles toward the waste basket.  In his haste, Drew puts all of his weight on the edge of his bath mat that you are both standing on.  Being as now Drew probably weighs at least two or three times what you do, you, Drew, and his cum wad, are sent flying through the air as your footing gets pulled out from beneath you.


&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-967.jpg&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

“Nooooooo!” you stupidly yell, only to open your mouth as the wad is catapulted into your face and Drew’s massive body envelopes you as you fall to the ground.

A huge amount of Drew’s massive load gets deposited at the back of your throat.  As you turn your head to the side and instinctively gag, instead of spitting it out you involuntarily swallow it down.  You begin to cough and retch, yet are unable to dispel the foul taste from your mouth.

//Oh my fucking god.  I just swallowed Drew’s cum!  My life is over.//  Hell is freezing over.  A huge flock of flying pigs soar across the sky in your mind.


&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-966.jpg&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

A couple of months earlier, no matter how much money, liquor or imagination was involved, such a scenario would have been absolutely impossible for you to conceive.

[[Scream]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="Scream" tags="" position="5140,8609" size="100,100">“Ugghh---aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!” you howl.  You rip free the thing on your face, reminiscent of a  face hugging creature from Half-Life, and throw the foul object off into the waste basket.  It disgusts you that the wadfeels so much lighter the second time around and knowing where at least some of its contents went.  You and Drew both awkwardly stand.

You pick up the towel rack that got ripped off the wall during your tumble.

Drew looks completely distraught, caught somewhere between outright shame and panic.  You barely resist the urge to beat Drew to death with the bar in your hand.

“Don’t you fucking say anything!” you screech at your friend as you push past him, out into the safety of the hall.  You leave without another word and don’t look back.

Soon you are out on the street, letting the fall air purge your senses clean.  While walking back to your house you suddenly realize that in your haste you did not wash before you left Drew’s house.
You hold up your right hand and slowly bring it to your face.  It is still noticeably sticky and obviously smells like Drew’s semen from a foot away, a scent like rotting salmon.  //Fucking gross!//  Your left hand goes to your lips, you don’t recall touching them before but they feel fuller and more supple than you remember.  They too are coated with a thin but noticeable layer of Drew’s cum.  //God fucking damnit!// You curse as you do your best to wipe it away. How could this have happened?  Maybe god is punishing you for your constant blaspheming and taking his name in vain.


&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-968.jpg&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

“God fucking damnit!” you explode again, this time aloud.  Several nearby children look frightened at your sudden outburst and run away.  You see a nearby man clearly mouth, “PMS” and turn away with a shake of his head.

You feel absolutely disgusting by the time you get home.

[[At home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="At home" tags="" position="5289,8696" size="100,100">You unlock your door slip into the house and are gracefully able to avoid Julie and her boyfriend as they stand chatting in the kitchen.  You dash upstairs and enter the bathroom. You look at the mirror and scowl.  The splatter was far worse than you thought, there was even a small amount of white fluid  in your //fucking hair//.  Just as you are about to hop in the shower, your eyes meet those of the girl in the mirror’s.  //Your eyes.//  You study your beautiful face.  It was the kind of face you would have eagerly imagined covering in your own seed not long ago. Drew was being very creepy but it was hard to get mad at him for having an attraction to ...//that...err... to me//, you correct yourself.
“What the fuck is happening to me?” you wonder as you step into the shower and let the hot water purge the rest of the  day’s sins from your body.  You  shower until the tank runs out of hot water.  You step out of the shower wearing only a cloak of steam.  You admire the buxom, cloudy outline of your figure in the mirror for a long moment before toweling off and heading to your bedroom. Once feeling slightly less dirty, you head into your room and lock the door.  

“I am a girl...and I somehow I ended up tasting Drew’s... //stuff//,” you say the words in absolute disbelief.  Clearly the impossible was possible.  How many other crazy things have you misjudged over the years?  Was Thor real?  Was the world filled with magic...or aliens or something?  Or had you somehow been cursed to deal with the most fucking disgusting, unlikely damned scenarios possible?

[[You get a text]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="Swallow the pill" tags="" position="13014,15597" size="100,100">It doesn’t take long before the world returns to its proper form. Eeverything is pleasurable and buzzing.

You are sitting down yet can now hear your heart thundering in your ears as if you had just returned from a jog.

“I guess I will start with your mouth first,” Mitch decides as he walks into view wearing only boxer shorts.

You don’t even bother protesting, sliding smoothly to your knees.  You run a slender hand over Mitch’s bulging crotch and he groans in pleasure.

Thirty seconds later, Mitch is thrusting his dirty, disgusting cock in and out your mouth.

“Uhh, take it you fucking cunt!” he shouts as he fucks your throat without any regard for your feelings or safety.

It isn’t long before Mitch’s breathing quickens and you finally near the end of your current suffering.

You close your eyes and let your face be a canvas for Mitch’s putrid all-natural artwork.

“Ahh, uh, uh, UHhhhh!” Mitch moans as he climaxes, covering your face with his stinking cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchfacial1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As Mitch’s semen dribbles down your face and gets in your eyes, you wish there was some magical way you could disappear from this moment and never again return.

[[Go on to round two]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="Go on to round two" tags="" position="13164,15640" size="100,100">Without ceremony or foreplay, Mitch begins to eagerly fuck you.  He rails you in a number of positions, using his muscled arms to steer your hips and direct your body any way he choses.

After a few minutes of too hard, almost angry fucking, you finally complain.  “You’re being too rough!” you tell Mitch as his balls slap loudly against you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchfuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ah, you love it, bitch!  Look at how wet you are.  You, Taylor Roux, are a born fuckin’ whore!” 

“Fucking asshole!” you shriek.

He suddenly stops screwing you and you slide off his cock with a sickening wet //pop// and crawl away.  You look to Mitch only to find him wearing the most demented looking smile you have ever seen.  “Fuck your asshole?” he muses.  “Yeah?  Yeah!  What a great idea Taylor!  Come here and point that cute butt in my direction,” he orders you with an iron note in his voice.

Even though you know Mitch is a creepy perv, you are still amazed this fucking creep wants to do such a thing.  Your pussy and mouth kind of made sense, one to demonstrate his power over you and the other for pleasure.  //Ugh...// You feel quite sick as you mentally answer your own question.  Fucking your ass would accomplish both goals for Mitch.
“That isn’t what I said!  No way is that happening, you lecherous piece of shit!  Exit-only!  And fuck you -I am not your god-damned slave!” you shout.

Mitch smirks in reply as if to say, “Not yet.”

[[Tell him to fuck off]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="183" name="Walk up to the group" tags="" position="3192,3892" size="100,100">
“Ohhh!  Evan brought a //girl//!  A hot one too!  I am //totally// shocked!” Rhea coos as the two of you approach the group.  

Jimmy gives you a nod of approval.  “Yep, total babe.  Nice job, Ev!” Jimmy calls out to his friend, fist pumping the air.

You feel your cheeks flush and, if Evan’s beet red face was any indicator, he shared your embarrassment.  You take a deep breath, preparing yourself to make another awkward re-introduction.  //Maybe I had better get used to these….  //

You think about what you are going to say for a few seconds as the group gathers around.  You see several familiar faces but can’t recall many names.  You briefly consider lying about your identity.  //Maybe I don’t have to lie though…//

[[Introduce yourself to the group]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="Listen to his request" tags="" position="3191,4341" size="100,100">“Well you’re really good looking…” he throws the compliment out to you.

“What the hell?  I don’t like where this is going!”

“Hey, relax.  It is just the two of us here.”  The reminder suddenly catches you off guard.  The dynamic between you two was somehow different than usual.  It wasn’t just two friends hanging out.  It was a man and a woman, predator and prey.  “You know both of our lives have been pretty fucked up lately, I just thought you would take pity on me and maybe show your boobs is all,” Evan says casually, making it seem like his request was no big deal.

“You’ve got to be kidding me!  I tell you that I owe you and you immediately cash in the favour one second later?  On something this crazy?  You want to see a guy&#39;s boobs.  Wow.” 

He stares back at you looking dead serious.  &quot;Please?&quot;

“Evan we are friends,” you try and reason with him.

“So?  Friends fuck all the time!”

“Whooooa!  Did you just say //“fuck”//?  What the hell is wrong with you?  A guy magically transforms into a girl and your first instinct is to fuck him?  What if he was infected with space aids or the transformation was contagious!?”

“Whoa, Taylor, just whoa.  Relax.  I am just saying this is freaking university.  Every college campus in the world has horny young people trying to experiment.  The number of friends with benefits type deals that exists globally is in the billions….probably.  You just got to use protection and use some common sense--that way you can can get the cornucopia of experiences,” he concludes sagely.

His statistics were perhaps not reliable but he did have a point.  College was meant to be fun, a chance to learn about different sides of yourself and expose your mind to things outside your common experience.

Your silence prompts Evan to continue, “You only live once right?  What happens if you change back tomorrow?  This is a unique opportunity, a once in a life-time chance, man!”

“Uggghh…exactly, //man!//  I-I…. I am a guy,” you finally manage to protest.  “I am definitely a guy,” you repeat.

[[Keep listening to Evan&#39;s bullshit]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="Let him admire you" tags="" position="3343,4602" size="100,100">
As the seconds tick on, you begin to feel weird and regret your choice to give Evan a brief show.

A tingle runs up your spine and you notice your nipples have become rock hard...again.  You get a queasy feeling in your stomach.

It felt //wrong// but it also felt so damn good to be admired.   You have to admit that Evan’s reaction was pleasing in a strange way.  You were never known to be the centre of attention or to command much of a presence when you entered a room.  One thing was for certain: you had 100% of Evan’s attention right now.  You can’t even truly blame him for ogling your chest, since you had spent countless hours at home on the net doing the exact same thing to other women over the years, and a bit of time since your transformation as well.

You let him stare until you begin to notice a change in your mental state.  At first Evan’s hungry stare had left you feeling embarrassed and nervous above all else.  Now, you can feel the undeniable warmth of arousal begin to creep and spread throughout your body.

That awareness makes you deeply uncomfortable.  //Ugh. This is bad!  I have to get out of here!  Evan is one of my best friends… what the fuck am I doing?//

“I have to go,” you manage to tell him, ashamed that it required every ounce of your willpower to do so.

Evan looks incredibly disappointed when you pull your shirt down again.

You pull yourself away from Evan, grab your bag, and head outside without another word.  You leave Evan sputtering awkward apologies.

On your walk back home you can’t think of anything else except reflect on what had to have been one of the most fucked up days //ever//.

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, with much cursing and frustration, you manage to close most of the pages until you have winnowed it down to a handful.  Finally, the last remaining tab launches a popup box when you attempt to shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Press okay to make Penis Enlargement HQ your homepage, agree to our TOS, and subscribe to our newsletter or cancel if you never want to possess a huge penis,” the message reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You drive the cursor to the cancel button only to hesitate, annoyed at the wording.  “Lose, lose,” you mutter under your breath.  You click cancel and it immediately triggers another popup window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure that you don’t want to be a real man?” the screen taunts you.  With a scowl, your cursor hovers back and forth between okay and cancel, unsure if it is some sort of trick question.  You eventually click okay and the window disappears...for about five seconds before it triggers a cascade of ridiculous pornographic ads across your screen.  You hope you don’t get a virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shit!  Shit!  Fuck!

Your house is empty at the moment since your sister, Julie, has been staying at her boyfriend’s lately...no doubt for the purpose of having a marathon sex session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ugh.”  You suppress a shiver of disgust as you briefly imagine your slutty sister getting railed.  “Ew!”  Your penis softens completely, feeling like it has gone into a sudden onset of hibernation.  You feel frustrated, unsatisfied, and, above all, //defeated//.&lt;/p&gt;[[Look around your room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="Hit the dusty trail home" tags="" position="5000,2145" size="100,100">You thank Drew for the asskicking and head home.

“Ahh!  What the fuck?  I feel really... not... good... AHHH! I am dying!?” you nearly scream as you lurch forward.

You mentally appraise your options.  Both your home and the campus medical center are approximately the same distance away.

You //really// don’t like hospitals but your current  overwhelming level of pain makes you forgive that preference.

[[Go home and weather the storm]]
[[Go to the campus medical center]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="After class..." tags="" position="3754,3339" size="100,100">You are standing next to Evan and Drew when Mitch walks by, stopping dead in his tracks.  He looks at the three of you standing together with a weird, completely perplexed expression on his face.  He singles you out and stares at you for a long moment, studying your facial features.  His eyes flicker with recognition and his eyes and shift to your backpack and it’s noticeable black and red pattern.  At that moment, Mitch looks even more confused as he stares dumbfounded at your face, while his internal computer is no doubt still processing the information contained in the scene directly in front of him.

Mitch walks up to you with his mouth open, as if he had never been more astonished.  “No way!  Just no fucking way,” he says as he steps up to you.

“//Fuck off!//” you yell at him.

Your outburst seems to confirm his suspicions.  “Wait.  You...you’re... you&#39;re really Taylor, aren&#39;t you?” At first he sounds horrified.  Yet, after saying the words aloud, an idea seemes to form in Mitch&#39;s mind, for his slack jaw gradually morphs into an amused smile.  “This is //perfect!//”  he says as he mouths the words, “Thank you” to the sky.

You want to get out of there, and far away from Mitch and any tranny jokes he is likely to lob your way.  You pack up and leave, finding a nearby alcove to speak with your friends.

[[Talk to your friends]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="Talk to your friends" tags="" position="3921,3434" size="100,100">
It is after classes and the school has rapidly emptied.  Drew and Evan are hovering nearby with a look of concern covering both their faces.

“So Taylor, what are you going to do?” Evan asks you bluntly but with a degree of sympathy.

“I don’t know.  Wish I knew…” you answer.

“More importantly, Taylor, how are you feeling?” Drew asks you.

“I feel…”  You were going to say “like shit,” but the question sparked a rapid internal assessment.  You find that you actually feel pretty damn good.  All traces of pain and nausea have vanished and you feel surprisingly peppy like someone with cabin fever out for the first run of spring. “I feel// weird,// not bad or anything, just kind of confused,” you elaborate.  “I don&#39;t have any idea how this happened, let alone an idea of where to look for a cure.  I am not sure anybody would believe me anyway, I mean I don’t have any proof, aside from myself.”  You bury your head in your hands.   “I don’t know what to do,” you sob, surprising yourself with an emotional edge to your voice.  You feel your eyes burn, as if fighting back tears.

“It is okay,” Evan consoles you, taking the lead.  “You can see a doctor in the morning or head there straight away.  The University Hospital is world renowned.”

“People don’t just magically change into the opposite sex.  There has to be a logical reason for it,” added Drew.  “No sense freaking out about it.  Maybe it is just temporary, either way you don’t seem to be in pain…  So that is quite positive.”

“We could take you to the emergency room at the city hospital now if you want,” Evan suggests.

You imagine how that scenario would play out.  In your fantasy you are soon a resident in a padded room, imprisoned in a mental hospital next to an axe-murderer.  “No, that is a bad idea,” you predict.  “I don’t have any life threatening symptoms, I’d be waiting for ten hours just to see a moron who wouldn’t be used to treating, well this,” you say with a gesture at your chest. 

“You’re right, Taylor,” Drew agrees.  “I think you will need to consult some more appropriate experts for your … //condition.//”

“I know.  I had similar thoughts.  I did some research briefly but didn’t have any luck,” you inform your friends.  You stretch out your slender arms.

“Well we will help you if you can,” promised Drew with a look to Evan.  Evan nodded readily.

“Well I doubt there is anything we can do tonight,” you say.

“If that is true, then nothing left to do but keep living life the way you usually do, right?” Evan concludes.  Evan often had a simple way of framing things that was refreshing.  

“Yeah, I guess,” you reply.  You agree with Evan in principle but find yourself wondering if such a thing is possible in your circumstances.  

“Your body has changed a bit, but you’re still you...uh...you know?” Evan fumbles with his words but you appreciate the sentiment.
[[Think things over]]

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Deter, in all his ample glory, lumbers forth and begins his lecture but not before taking attendance.  The portly man then strolls onto the stage with his large pot belly bouncing around as he drones on  about the slideshow he begins to present.  As Deter lectures, you can’t help but be distracted as he constantly plays with his huge moustache that looks far too similar to Stalin’s to be a coincidence.  You love psychology but hate Mr. Deter’s psych class.  He was an angry guy, prone to harsh grading and snapping at students.  And the cherry on top: he took mandatory attendance call, unlike nearly all your other classes.  This meant you had to endure such torture three times a week and avoiding it was impossible.  When it came to grading, Mr.Deter was also one of the harshest in the entire faculty.  Getting an A in his class was nearly impossible.  Since Mr. Deter also had dual specialties, he spent a lot of time in the university’s biology lab.  His expertise made him particularly insufferable and arrogant in your estimation and led to Deter frequently getting sidetracked by issues unrelated to the psych class he was actually supposed to be teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“...and from this we can only conclude that the mind is quite malleable if the appropriate pressures are applied,” Mr. Deter finally concludes.  You look up from your page scrawled with elaborate doodles with a feeling of relief.  Finally this awful day is almost over.&lt;/p&gt;

You have lived your whole life in this fashion, sailing wherever the wind blows you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan shakes his head with feigned disbelief.  “Well, what about right now?” he asks you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hmm… good question.  I am kind of anxious to get home...I, uhh... I got some ... //stuff// to take care of...but it does feel like ages since we have all chilled together too… I dunno…” you respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nah, another time maybe.  I am going to head home, pretty eager to play this one.  Taylor, you are welcome to join me. I’ve been waiting for this game for ages!” Drew enthusiastically offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pfffttt!” Evan makes an unflattering farting noise that makes his opinion on that idea known.  “How about about some soccer?  I usually play in the south field after class, if you want to join.  Going to meet some friends for a pickup game in the courtyard right now too if you are interested.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hmmm…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You decide to:&lt;/p&gt;[[Go with Drew]]

You feel...//fucking awesome//, better than you ever have before in your entire life.

You walk around with an unshakeable grin.  Everyone you meet is amazing.  You’re amazing.  Everything is amazing!

You feel yourself drawn to people and you become giggly and flirtatious.  You feel a strange empathy and connection to everyone you meet, as if all humans are psychically connected.  It feels like the word “hate” has been removed from your vocabulary, your mental dictionary scoured of words and replaced with only thing that mattered, //love.//
As you glide around the house you spot Jerry from the lab.

“Jerry!  How’s it going?” you ask him.  You touch his arm and feel like you have known him all your life.

“Hey Taylor, I really like your dress.”

“I like it too,” you admit.  “I think I like //everything// tonight!” you add with a giggle.  The fabric of Jerry’s shirt seems strangely alluring, and you rub a bit of it between your fingers, savouring the texture.  Jerry gives you a knowing look.

Some loud music starts to play and you decide to find its source, dancing until you become thirsty.  The music seemed to take control of your body.  You usually hated dancing, but tonight you clearly loved it.

You feel your heart racing faster and faster but the waves of pleasure keep flowing.  You go the kitchen and get a glass of water.  As you down your glass of water, you overhear Jimmy and Jerry speaking nearby.

“Fuck, that asshole Mitch is here,” mutters Jimmy.

“He is a bit rough around the edges,” Jerry answers.  “My bad though.  I texted him that girl he likes is here.  He told me to let him know if I saw her, gave me a big bag for free.”

“What girl?”

“He is totally obsessed with that weird Taylor chick,” Jerry answers with a shrug.

[[Enjoy the party]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="You agree with Rhea" tags="" position="3347,4094" size="100,100">“Shit!” you curse under your breath, finding yourself surprisingly drawn into the game.  You just wish it wasn&#39;t so damn awkward to run...or move at all for that matter.  Anytime you pick up speed your breasts bounce around excessively like you are on fucking //Beach Watch// or some shit.  Ten minutes into the game and you already feel chafed half raw.  You are almost certain you could run even faster but the idea of giving your friends an eyeful gives you pause.

Suddenly Rhea passes you the ball and you start to advance down the field.  Jimmy and the other players swarm you but not before you gracefully kick the ball straight to Evan.

“Shhoooot!!!” you yell and Evan obliges, pulling his leg back as he boots it right in between the goal posts.

“Yeaah!  I did it!” Evan exclaims, exulting in his goal.  For a moment he looks incredibly childish, revelling in his accomplishment.  He then looks directly at you and you see his grin widen even more.  “We did it Taylor!  We are making a //comeback!//”

“Fuck yeah we are!” you yell back as the game intensifies.  You end up trying to move as quickly as you can and find yourself fairly pleased with your athletic performance.  As soon as your inhibitions are loosened your performance improves.  Once you stopped caring about how your tits must look bouncing around, how embarrassing any given moment was etc, you realized you could move //a lot// faster.

You and Rhea end up passing back and forth, having the ball stolen and stealing it back.

“Now!  To me!  I am open!” you almost scream as the players finally shift into a favourable position.

Evan shoots the ball to you and you dash forward, faking the goalie out and zipping the ball through the air, right through the open corner of the goal boundaries.

“Yeaaaaah!” you yell.  You can’t remember the last time you scored in a game of sport.  //Fuck that feels good!//  You dance around, imitating Evan for a moment.  Suddenly the jocks didn’t seem //quite// so crazy in their obsessions.

&lt;p&gt;Standing nearby with a smirk on his face is Mitch.  His real name is Mitchel Schnapps, but everyone just calls him Mitch or “Snaps”.  He is a tall guy, mean looking and well built with light skin and features.  Mitch is also quite muscular, spending much of his time working out and making small time drug deals.  He seemed immensely proud of both his physique and illegal shenanigans.  You have strongly disliked Mitch since the moment you first met several years earlier.  He always was aggressive, crass, and rude - not traits you held in high regard, despite your own legendary pottymouth.  Mitch was known to be a loud mouthed asshole and you had clashed with and witnessed his bullshit on numerous occasions before.  Some people even mockingly called him names but never to his face.  As you glance at Mitch’s smirk,  you feel the urge to punch him right in his smug face, but you stop yourself because you know that if it came to a fight you would probably take the worst of it, given the large difference in stature.  And then YOU would most likely be expelled and take the brunt of the punishment, which would be way worse for you than him since Mitch was an academic nothing.  You really want to retaliate but don’t want to make a scene before class.  Although, of course you don’t have to physically punch him to strike back…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You decide to:&lt;/p&gt;[[Ignore him]]

You feel yourself becoming accustomed to your body and the minor...and major alterations it has made to your life.

You look down at your boobs and sigh.  They are merely just //your boobs.//  Your sex may have transformed, but you had always thought you would preserve your gender identity, your male mind and proud sense of identity.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempovj.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

You think about your life since your transformation… wondering if maybe you have become a bit //too// accustomed to your new body and the relative pleasures it has offered you.

Are you gay?  Straight?  Bi?  Did any of those words even mean much at all when pushed through the vice of circumstance?  Maybe you are just transitioning into something else.  Maybe you’re just a freak, a trans-figure, someone standing in the doorway of many different paths and identities.

[[Mull over your thoughts]]

“I am getting used to //this//.”  Even hearing your soprano voice, all the weird little differences have gradually faded from your notice.  //This is just my body now.//  It is just normal when you look down and see a pair of breasts, or when your hair brushes over your face.  It becomes harder to even remember the way you were before.  The idea of forgetting your past, of accepting and embracing your new self terrifies and excites you in ways that are difficult to describe.

You had to admit it, the longer you stay like this, the more difficult it would be to change back.  At a certain point all of this madness had somehow just become normal.  Your body was undeniably female but you had always resisted the idea that Taylor Roux had changed too.  Your brain, your soul, your character, how could that all change so easily as well?  Was your very heart changing into a woman’s as well?  How was such a thing possible?  Was it because of the changes themselves or because of your environment and the people around you?  It was hard to say, but if you had to guess, you would bet it was a bit of both.  One thing was certain: you almost feel like an entirely different person.

[[Continue to midgame]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="197" name="Drew..." tags="" position="4257,746" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drew.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew, on the other hand, wears large spectacles and is overweight. Drew exists in a state of permanent dishevelment.  You don’t think you have ever seen him with combed hair, although he did seem to take an inordinate amount of time to polish his glasses at every opportunity.  Drew is even nerdier and more introverted than you, which is rare.  Drew spends most of his time indoors, at his computer.  He is very smart and quite knowledgeable in a trivia-esque sorta of way.  You definitely consider him a good guy though, albeit more than a bit eccentric. You have been friends for ages and get along well for the most part, except when Drew gets in one of his weird, almost autistic moods.  You recall an incident in sixth grade when you promised to meet at 6PM and arrived two minutes late.  Drew had been furious, called you a liar, and refused to speak to you for weeks until you apologised.  Thankfully, you have found that he has mellowed out over the years.  Even though you originally thought the whole scenario of friendship to be bizarre, you have found Drew to be a comforting companion and a good friend, perhaps because you share so many similar interests and due to the obvious fact he made you look outgoing by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being physical opposites and truthfully possessing a lot in common, Evan and Drew didn’t get along very well.  Yet together you make a nearly inseparable trio.  Your presence was definitely the common thread that wove the three of you together as friends.  Without you, you suspected that Evan and Drew would not speak to each other at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as you are about to greet your friends, you feel a sudden flash of pain as something strikes the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ouch, damnit!” you yelp.&lt;/p&gt;[[Turn to face your attacker]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylormirror3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The woman, //That’s me//, you correct yourself with a blush, bares more than a passing resemblance to your sister, Julie, but there were subtle differences.  This woman’s face was narrower, the nose slightly more upturned, and the crooked smile she now wore was too familiar to deny.  Her features were undeniably your own.

You tentatively pat down your new body.  Your previous pain is completely gone and you now appear to be healthy.  //A healthy girl.//

“How the hell did this happen?  Is such a thing even possible?” you demand of your reflection. //It is definitely impossible!  ----- No, it’s obviously not impossible if it just happened to me!//  You rack your brain for a reason to explain your transformation or for a solution to your predicament but nothing surfaces.  //What do I do now?//  You eventually wonder, //Google “I randomly transformed into a girl, how do I change back?”// “Fuck me,” you sigh, confident that any searches will just yield some bizarre fetish porn.  Still, what other choice do you have?

[[Use your computer]]

As your eyes roam around the hall you see something.  Much to your horror, you notice &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Mitch&quot; &quot;Mitch desc&quot;&gt;&gt; is staring at you.  You try and move out of view behind a group of people chatting but a quick glance back shows that he is still looking directly at you.  You feel uncomfortable as he overtly studies your body and makes no effort to hide his intent.

You try and ignore him and focus on your conversation with your friends but that only seems to encourage Mitch.  Every time you look back he is staring right at you.  The last thing you want is to pique that asshole’s curiosity while you are stuck like this.  Yet Mitch seems like a dog that just sighted a bone.  It doesn&#39;t take long before Mitch boldly strolls right up to you.

“Wow, hey beautiful!  Damn girl, you are so fine!”  You turn and face Mitch and are shocked when you realize he is speaking to you.  He now towers above you.  He was intimidating before, yet now his presence is on a whole new level.  As soon as you make eye contact, Mitch smiles.  “I can’t believe I have never seen you here before.  Yo, beautiful, tell me, what’s your name?” he asks you.  //He doesn’t recognize me?//

You are stunned.  “My name is...Taylor,” you stammer a reply, suddenly glad for a unisex name.

“Well Taylor, what are you doing tonight?” Mitch asks you with a sly smile.  He rests a hand against the wall and looms over you, cutting you off from your friends.

//Is he...hitting on me!?  Wow.  Most fucked up day EVER!//

[[Go into the classroom]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="201" name="Think things over" tags="" position="3759,3492" size="100,100">What Evan said was true.  On the inside you were still the same person you always were, or at least you hope that is still the case.

“You seem stressed,” appraises Drew.

“I //am// stressed!  Fucking look at me!”

Drew blushes as he takes your suggestion and ends up staring at you, his gaze lingering for an uncomfortable duration on your breasts.

“Maybe a game would get your mind off of things for a few hours,” suggests Evan.  “You should take it easy, at least until this is all sorted out.”

“Yes, a real //video// game would really take his...uh- her...//Taylor’s// mind off his...her….predicament,” Drew suggests instead.

//A distraction is maybe just what I need right now.  Where should I go?//

You decide to:

[[Go to a soccer game with Evan]]
[[Go play videogames with Drew]]
[[Search for information at school]]
[[Head home]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="202" name="Keep listening to Evan&#39;s bullshit" tags="" position="3350,4385" size="100,100">Evan laughs.  “Taylor, right now not even the most elderly, dementia riddled, blind man would mistake you for anything but a woman.”

His words leave you stunned.  “So you’re okay with looking at... at touching a man?” you ask him after a moment.  You can’t believe one of your best friends has just suddenly become gay.

“Hah, you remember when we joked about traps?” Evan recalls, dodging the question.

“I am not a fucking trap!” you snap at him.

“Exactly!  That is what I have been trying to say, Taylor.  You are a //girl.//  A //fucking hot// girl.  You, of all people, have got to be curious.  So you can’t exactly blame me for being interested.  It is not like I have infinite access to hot babes, especially one I actually get along with and know for sure isn’t that crazy.”

You stare daggers at him, attempting to force Evan to recant his last statement with willpower alone.  Instead he just smiles confidently-//dumbly// at you, unphased by your protests.  His fucked up logic bends your mind so much it nearly causes you physical pain.  //What a fucking moron,// you think as your head spins.  Still, somewhere within that labyrinth of retardation was perhaps a grain of truth.

Yet now your admiration is a double edged sword, Ryan’s confident smile now catches you off guard sets a group of butterflies loose in your stomach..

When greeted with such a display of perfect, white teeth you cannot help but flash your own.

“Hello!” Ryan says.  Ryan then raises an eyebrow and looks to Julie.  “This is home?  I didn’t know Julie had such a lovely roommate.  I thought- uh,didn’t you have a brother?” Ryan asks Julie, as if struggling to remember you at all.

“Yeah, of course!  My brother...uh...//Tyler,// he uh…got accepted into an...uh... //exchange// program...in //Europe//.  This beautiful lass, is my cousin, Taylor - she’s from out of town but got accepted into the university.  With, uh... //Tyler// gone, we had a room open and she needed the place...and the cheap rent.”

//Fuck, Julie, you are such an awful liar.//
“I see,” Ryan responds.  He seems a little bit confused but happy to be in the company of two young ladies. 

“Well, hello Taylor, it is an absolute pleasure to meet you.  Are all the women in your entire family this beautiful?”
“Yep!” Julie answers.  “The Roux women are //blessed.//”

You find it //very// hard to breathe, like you are at the summit of a mountain at high altitude.  For an instant, your eyes meet Ryan’s and then suddenly you are dying of embarrassment as a moment of clarity washes over you.  //What the fuck have we-I just done!?//  You have just had the most intimate, intense kiss of your life and it was with //Ryan!//

You had just kissed-practically made out with //your sister’s fucking boyfriend// --a //man!//  You feel so ashamed you want to cry.  You are honestly not sure which part bothers you more: the implied betrayal of your sister or the homosexual conundrum that just ran you over.  //But to Ryan I am not a guy...but I am...AHH!  It doesn’t fucking matter!  I have to get out of here!//

You finally manage to untangle yourself from Ryan and slip away as fast as your shapely little legs can carry you.

Ryan attempts to apologize, a hand reaching out as if to stop you, but he lets you go.

Your sister eagerly takes Ryan’s cock.  If it wasn’t your sister you are sure it would be super hot.  At that moment a thought occurs to you that shakes you to your very core.  You had been trying to focus on Ryan, on imagining your sister to be someone else.  Your sister and you now shared a remarkable similarity in appearance.  With a knot in your stomach that nearly makes you puke, you fantasize it could just as easily be you, and not Julie who was bent over the bed.

“Uhnn...” you almost don’t notice that your hand has been furiously petting the opening to your slit.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/finger.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="206" name="Masturbate" tags="" position="12466,13339" size="100,100">Ryan shifts position, you now find your sister’s back is to the door.  Julie begins to fuck Ryan cowgirl style and you can’t help but masturbate furiously while watching them.  Eventually, Ryan rises to a sitting position and takes your sister’s ass cheeks in hand, taking control of the thrusts, driving your sister into him with greater and greater force.

You watch their sex with awe.  It looks so wild...and //fun.//  It is obvious that both of them are //really// enjoying themselves.

You feel yourself nearing orgasm when suddenly there is a instant where you are sure that you make direct eye contact with Ryan.  The moment you do, Ryan proceeds to rail your sister with even greater force.

You keep stroking and rubbing yourself, losing yourself completely in the scene before you.  It isn’t long before the sexual pressures overwhelm you and your pelvis begins to grind against your hand as you push yourself over the edge into the blissful, beckoning white light.

Your sister howls with pleasure and you feel momentarily jealous.

On trembling legs, you creep back to bed.  It takes ages to fall asleep, your thoughts haunted by uncomfortable feelings that you desperately fight to push away.  You pray that Ryan didn’t really see you and that the morning will exorcise the sins of the night.

[[You hear a distant knocking sound]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="207" name="Let the experience continue" tags="" position="12609,14148" size="100,100">
“Ohh…” you find yourself sighing and tensing up as Ryan’s hand slowly creeps from your hip downwards, brushing across your now trembling thighs.  With a large finger, Ryan traces a snake pattern across your legs, rubbing you firmly but gently before placing his hand in from of your yearning, feminine sex.  Ryan’s touch makes you shiver and forces you to break your kiss, reclining your head slightly, mouth open.

Ryan intently studies your reactions with a look of approval.  He then follows up with a deep, passionate kiss that goes on for so long you begin to feel so light headed you genuinely feel that you might pass out at any moment.

“Uhhh….”  One of Ryan’s huge hands begins to fondle one of your breasts.  He begins tracing the hard outline of your niples and teasing you with his caresses until feel like putty in his practiced, strong hands.

The more Ryan continued to explore your body the more you felt any prospect of resisting slipping away.  //It feels so good…//  You try and think of a feasible alternative.  Yet the only alternative of feeling good was to not feel good, or to do so in a different way.  If that was the case, you know which you would chose.

[[Let Ryan fondle you]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="208" name="Ryan continues kissing you" tags="" position="12610,14439" size="100,100">
He rubs your areola and teases your nipples.  You are positively beet red from the experience.  You have never experienced such a sensual assault.  No wonder girls like kissing, you think as you manage to take a much needed breath.  “You’re just so sexy I want to ravish and devour you….//You’re so fucking beautiful,//” Ryan praises you.  The way he looks at you and and says the words makes you certain he means it with every fiber of his being.

Why did he have to say such things to you?  And why did they make you feel like someone you were not?  You know he probably said the same stupid shit to Julie, yet there you are swallowing it hook, line, and sinker.

Ryan begins to cover you with kisses and caresses until you are left shivering and soaked from sweat and your own feminine juices and still Ryan strokes and worships your body, from your slick, pouted lips although the way to your engorged clit.  Your body felt so hot it might just burst aflame and your reactions only seemed to encourage your sister’s boyfriend to tease you to higher plateaus of pleasure.

[[Endure]]

You hear a noise.  There is a creak at the top of the staircase.  You and Ryan exchange an equally terrified look.

Your hand is still wrapped around his rapidly softening manhood.  //Nooooo, I don’t want to die!//  

Your terror gives you haste.  With a sweeping motion, you gather up as much cum as possible, and with the other hand placed below to catch cum drips, you awkwardly stumble towards the bathroom while Ryan begins to fumble with his pants.

You just manage to make it inside the washroom before you hear your sister speaking in the living room.

“Did Taylor go to bed?” you hear your sister’s voice just as you enter the bathroom.

“Yeah she just left.  Seemed a bit depressed and the movie wasn’t that good. I was trying to cheer her up though, I told her a few jokes and she seemed a bit happier I think.”

“Well it was nice of you to spend some time with her, I know she is sort of weird sometimes.  She isn’t very good at making friends.  Anyway...bed?”

“Bed,” Ryan agreed.  “Been a long day.”

“I agree,” Julie says with a yawn.

You hear the pair go upstairs together and breathe a sigh of relief.  That intake of breath suddenly reminds you of your pungent cargo.  Even from a foot away, you can still make out the musky odor of Ryan&#39;s ejaculation.  //Ewwwwwwwwww!//  You return to your senses.

Inside the bathroom, you glance down at your sticky, soiled hands with mixed emotions.  Water soon cleans it all away, but a faint musty smell lingers on your skin. 

 //Wow, what a fucking night,// you think as you flop onto your bed.  Tonight’s experience left you feeling sexy, satisfied, and admittedly, more than a bit guilty.  “Oh man, what the heck is going to happen to me next?” you wonder as you close your eyes and eventually fall into a thankfully dreamless sleep.  

[[The next morning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="210" name="Wait for Evan" tags="" position="2604,8649" size="100,100">
A few moments later Evan returns, startling you.  He sets down a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer.

“Find us a movie?”

“Yep.”  You rattle off the names.

“Whatever you want.  You can pick.”

“Hmm… okay.”  Evan was usually opinionated and pretty picky.  You decide to watch something you might both enjoy, an action comedy about aliens.

Evan pops the caps off the beer bottles with an opener conveniently lying on the floor nearby.  He hands you a beer and you accept.

Soon you forget your previous awkwardness as you and Evan immerse yourself in the movie, laughing uproariously at the silly parts.

About halfway through the movie you become aware of an building pressure.  Your bladder feels like it is about to explode.

“Yooo!  Pause this.  I need to take a piss,” you inform Evan.

“More like you are pissed!” Evan laughs at you as you try to stand.  To your dismay, you find that you are surprisingly unsteady.  You nearly kick over a trio of empty beer bottles as you stagger forward.

“Whoa.”  You had been so absorbed in the movie that you didn’t realize you were drinking so much.  You set down what was apparently your fourth empty beer since arriving and manage to meander over to the hallway.

[[Go to the washroom]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="Run to the bathroom" tags="" position="2603,8787" size="100,100">
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytoilet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your bladder finally is able to empty, just moments before you feel it might explode.  As the urine rushes out of you, your mind wanders and you feel a twinge of nostalgia as you recall how once such relief would bring an additional feeling of pleasure that was now absent, perhaps due to your missing prostate.

As you wash up, your eyes meet those of the girl in the mirror.  //She looks so pretty,// you think before you blink a few times and correct yourself.

You head back into Evan’s room and see your friend has brought you each two new fresh beers.

You hesitate as Evan hands you one.  Your tolerance seems markedly lower and you don’t want to throw up later on.

“You can crash here if you want.  It’s no prob,” Evan assures you.

“Yeah...but…”  The circumstances were a bit different now.  //I am a bit different now.//

“What?  You’ve passed out here a bunch of times.  We still have half the movie left...and a lot of beer!” he adds.

“That’s a pretty convincing argument,” you admit as you pick up the bottle.  “Cheers,” you say as you clink the glass together.

“That’s fair!  I just want to look.”

“You just want to look?  I already said...”

“I haven’t seen a real pussy in like a year.  I am kind of curious too, did you really become a woman completely?  Please just show me, have mercy on me.”

“Huh!? That’s //so// stupid.”

&quot;It isn&#39;t an arguement; it&#39;s a request!&quot;

&quot;I wonder about you sometimes.&quot;

“So you’ll do it!?  Oh thank you Taylor!”

“Ughh… &quot;  You feel so light headed and bubbly.  //Maybe I absorbed the bubbles from the beer...along with the alcohol...  That&#39;s possible, right?// &quot;Hic!  Um...&quot;  You feel your self control crumbling.  &quot;Okay I will show you but only this once and you can’t touch me or ever breathe a word of this to anyone, understand?” you drunkenly bargain with Evan.

Evan looks ecstatic when you agree.  “Anything!  I swear.  Please just show me!  I will owe you big time.”

You sigh.  “I am just as dumb as you are,” you say as you slip off your shirt and jeans.  

[[Strip down for Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="Strip down for Evan" tags="" position="2452,9044" size="100,100">Evan watches you take your clothes off like a hungry wolf eyeing a steak.

Evan’s room is so cluttered your only choice is to lie on the bed.  You lie down face first and then raise your ass, presenting your most intimate places for your friend to inspect.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/present.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan gasps at the sight you provide him.  He studies your privates in detail for what seems like ages.  Suddenly you feel the bed shift and hear the springs creak as Evan climbs on the bed behind you.

“Hey!  No touching!”

“I am not, I just wanted to get a better view.”

“Tck...err…” you can’t really protest given your position.  You can now feel Evan’s breath on your bare pussy.  You can feel yourself getting wet.

“Oh wow, Taylor, you’re soaked.  You’re opening up for me.  It is pretty obvious you want this just as much as I do.”

“Noooo….  T-That&#39;s not fucking true!”

Evan can no longer restrain himself and he suddenly grabs your ass, his hard, strong fingers plying open your butt cheeks.

That is the last straw.  You kick back at Evan like a mule, striking him right in between his balls and crushing his erection.  Evan stumbles backwards, allowing you time to right yourself.  You angrily dress and leave the room with Evan still nursing his bruised manhood.

//Fucking unbelievable!// you fume as you storm home.

[[Pass out]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="“Your what!?”" tags="" position="2351,9198" size="200,200">“Don’t be such a stickler.  I practically single handedly solved the mystery of the century in a few hours. These research projects are a heck of a coincidence,” Evan notes.

“They are,” you agree with a sigh.

“Come on, I said I am sorry about last night and I made amends. Taylor, c&#39;mon, please?” he pleads.

You don’t even want to consider what kind of “reward” he would demand.  “Evan, I am a guy,” you respond weakly.  

“No you aren’t, Taylor!” Evan disagrees.  His seriousness catches you off guard.

“How can you not be creeped out by this?” you say with a wave at yourself and your surroundings.

“Well if you looked like a dude, sure, but you don’t because you aren’t.  You look like a //goddess.”

A what!?//  You feel your heart skip a beat.  //That is definitely the weirdest thing anyone has ever said to me//, you think with a growing sense of alarm.

“Look at yourself,” Evan continues as he dashes to a nearby door and grabs a pocket mirror from the bathroom.  You stare at your reflection.  The big, bright eyes, the sensual full lips, along with the unmistakably female and undeniably pretty face that went with it.

“How could I resist that?” Evan mused, his voice full of longing.  “The fact that we are friends only makes things better!” he insisted.  “We already know each other and get along great.”

“What exactly are you saying?” you manage to ask him.  You feel dizzy, confused, and surprisingly watm.

“All I am saying is you shouldn’t be so uptight.  You’re a beautiful girl, we’re in university, we can do whatever we want!  Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if you just accept your circumstances and, you know, roll with it.  Have some fun for a change!”

The words are surprisingly wise, especially coming from Evan.  You have to admit he probably has a point.  You may have a lead but you suspect you are still no closer to discovering a way to change back.  Plus, you suspect your transformation may very well be permanent.  It would be a shame to let it ruin your life.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="Drink and play cards" tags="" position="2445,9546" size="100,100">Soon you are buzzed and sitting around a smoky card table with Jimmy, Evan, and a couple of their mutual acquaintances, Jerry and Robbie, plus the two smokin&#39; hot babes, Samantha and Rhea.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rhea.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Rhea, despite being a knockout blonde, keeps making vulgar jokes as you play, laughing at each uproariously.  Sam smiles along but seems more reserved, constantly fussing with her bright red hair.

You win a few rounds and find yourself up a significant amount. Evan pushes another drink towards you with a grin and you accept.

“How about we make this a bit more interesting?” Jimmy throws the suggestion at the table.

“Strip poker!” Rhea yells.  Rhea laughs as she studies your reaction.  “We could always do Truth or Dare, too,” she adds.

Everyone at the table seems to be waiting for your decision for some reason.  You don’t really like either option but decide to...

[[Play strip poker]]
[[Play Truth or Dare]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="216" name="Kiss Evan" tags="" position="2499,9953" size="100,100">
Your lips meet Evan’s and instead of revolting and strange, it just feels pleasant and unremarkable. // Maybe this wasn’t such a big deal after all… //you think as a pleasurable warmth begins to spread through your body.  Your lips caress and explore each other up close and personal.  Suddenly you draw apart when you hear giggling.  You feel dizzy, unable to gauge just how long you and Evan were touching.  Was that thirty seconds or five minutes?  You couldn’t tell.  You shake your head to dispel your conflicting, confusing feelings and are greeted with your soft brown hair swishing against your face.

“See I told you they like each other!” Rhea laughs.

You and Evan draw away with no sound but for your heavy breathing and a diappointed sigh from Evan as you break apart.  You now feel //very weird. // There is a cacophony of voices yelling within your mind.  Urging you forward, urging you to run, to fight, to give in.

At least that was over with for now.  //How many rounds does this damn game have anyway?// you wonder before freezing.  //Fuck, it probably goes on forever or until people are too drunk to play.//  It was now Sam’s turn.

“Sam, you’re up,” booms Jimmy.

“Yeah, I am thinking.  Hmmm.  I yield my turn to Rhea,” Sam says with a giggle.

“What!?  You can’t do that!” you protest.  Rhea //totally// has it out for you.

Sam shrugs and looks to Jimmy, the apparent arbiter of Truth or Dare.

“She can do as she likes,” Jimmy decideses.

Rhea cackles and flashes you a devilish grin.  “I want you to give Evan a handjob,” she says, not quite a demand but not quite a request either.

//What the hell!?//  You are beginning to think Rhea is a huge slut.

“Rhea, are you fucking kidding me?”

Rhea looks absolutely stunned at your protest.  “Those are the rules, //bitch//.  Get jerkin’.”

[[Keep going]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="217" name="Give Evan a handjob" tags="" position="2700,10646" size="100,100">
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hj.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

You are now aware how hot and hard Evan’s cock feels in your hand.  You feel overwhelmed by a spate of temporary insanity as your tiny hand begins to glide up and down his cock, much to the delight of Evan and the onlookers.

“You go girl!” Rhea cheers as the pace of your strokes intensifies.
You feel yourself slipping away, like a heavy fog had suddenly encroached upon your mind and blotted out all good sense. 

It seems almost like a dream or some sort of bizarre out of body experience.  You see Evan’s cock twitching as a small, pale hand jerks him off.  You see Evan’s blissful face and then Rhea and Sam laughing.  You don’t even know what is happening anymore.

The next thing you are conscious of is Evan’s bulging and writhing cock.  You can feel it pulse in your hand and you look down only to be greeted by a jet of cum that splatters across your chin and drips down your chest.  There is a moment of numb disbelief as Evan continues to fill your hand with his semen.  He grunts and begins thrusting, pumping into your hand like a pussy.  

//I just gave one of my best friends a hand job...what the fuck is wrong with me?// You despair as Evan slackens in your hand and the heady scent of his ejactulation wafts through the air.

“Whooo!” Rhea shouts with glee.  You have no idea what to do now.  Rhea sees your distress and starts whooping and laughing with delight.

[[You withdraw your hand from Evan’s crotch.]]

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/handjob2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your soft hand massages Evan’s manhood.  He grows hot and hard in your hand as you silently begin to pump him with an eagerness that surprises both of you.  Evan seems to be enjoying himself and lets out a moan of pleasure.  Every slight movement, even the barest touch of your slender fingers coaxes a delightful reaction from him.  You shift close to him on the couch and you feel Evan bulge in your hand.  //Oh… he is pretty excited….//  Eventually your hand gets tired and you shift positions, sliding down to kneel on the floor in front of Evan.  Judging by his cock’s reaction Evan clearly approves of the view looking down at you.  The position reminds you uncomfortably of thousands of porno pictures you&#39;ve seen of girls giving head.   //Sucking...dick....// You feel your head moving towards Evan’s dick.  A really fucked up part of you wonders what it would taste like to….

//What the fuck!?//  You shake your head, pulling away but continuing your movements up and down Evan’s dick.

Your hand pleasures Evan and he is soon at his limit.  

“Ohhh Taylor!  Ohh!  Ohhh!  Ohhh fuuuckkk!” he yells as he orgasms, shooting his cum all over the chest area of your top.

“Fuck I don’t have a change of clothes!” you yell at him as his semen drips down your chest.

[[God damnit Evan!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="219" name="Watch the rare alien flick" tags="" position="2346,11595" size="100,100">
Evan clearly did not enjoy the film as much as you did.  When the credits finally roll you feel content but a bit disappointed it was over.  It was honestly the most fun you have had since your incident.  As you look over at Evan there is a small part of you that wants to thank him in a way you could not with words alone.

With the movie over you sit in an awkwardly tense environment.  For a moment, you and Evan lock eyes and you suddenly feel like a deer caught in the headlights.  You two stare at each other for too long...way too long.  You suddenly feel your throat become dry, distracting yourself with a sip of wine, only to shock yourself that your once full, and often refilled glass, was again empty.

You feel the weight on the couch shift as Evan sits next to you.  You look up at him and feel butterflies surge and flutter in your stomach.  Something is most definitely very wrong.

“Taylor…” Evan says your name and it snaps you back to reality.  His voice is hoarse and full of intense longing.  You are certain you could guess some of what was going through his mind.

“Evan...I really appreciate everything but...I….”

“No “buts,” Taylor.  We are just friends helping each other out, nothing more.”  Evan then slowly runs a hand down your inner thigh. “That said, we both have needs...and judging by the heat I can feel coming off you I think we are both pretty //needy// right now.”  You see what he means as your eyes are drawn to his boner, straining against the fabric of his pants.

[[Look at Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="220" name="Suck Evan&#39;s dick" tags="" position="2348,11742" size="100,100">//Well, here goes nothing...//


 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evansuck1.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You lick him from base to tip, tasting the salty flare on your tongue.  Evan’s cock twitches in your hand as you lightly stroke him.  You can feel the blood rushing to his extremity, causing it grow as you watch until it swells to its limit.  //Wow his dick is fucking big...and hard...because of me.  Fuck.//

You have never done anything like this before so your movements at first are awkward and minimal.  Yet with Evan’s moans urging you on, it isn’t long before your movements become smoother and your saliva coats Evan’s manhood completely.

“Ohhh yeah….” Evan moans.
[[Try and make Evan cum]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="Try and make Evan cum" tags="" position="2500,11792" size="100,100">Evan’s reactions were almost funny in a way.  Yet repaying a pleasurable feeling was pleasurable in and of itself.  You stop caring how fucked up things are and just focus on pleasing Evan.

It isn’t long before your actions reach their inevitable conclusion.  Soon Evan begins grunting while forcefully thrusting into your mouth.  He takes control of his own pleasure in the last instant, forcing you firmly but gently to your knees as he jerks off over your open, waiting mouth.

With a loud groan and several huge spurts, Evan cums all over your open mouth and lips.  He covers your tongue with his creamy, white semen.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminmouth4.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The disgusting taste of Evan’s cum makes you nearly gag.  //Ugh, gross!  The porn stars lie!//

As Evan looks down at you with a look of blissful satisfaction you immediately feel embarrassed.  Shame floods over you.  You just sucked your best friend’s dick.  You realize you have crossed a very important line.

//Ugh, what’s happened to me?//  You wonder as you spit into a nearby wastebasket and wipe the cum from your lips on the back of your sleeve.

“Wow….thanks Taylor.  That was awesome.  Made my week, nah more like my whole year!  It has been a long time for me and I needed that.  You are the best.”

His encouragement leaves you feeling conflicted.  You decide to leave before things get even more out of hand.

You walk home with a heavy heart, a stained shirt, and an uncomfortably wet pair of panties.

[[The day after]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="222" name="That does sound promising..." tags="" position="2504,11947" size="100,100">
A lot more promising than the journal about intersex rats you happened to be perusing.

You know you should probably put a little space between you and Evan before things get //really// out of hand, but you can’t quite bring yourself to pass up the opportunity to potentially learn something useful about your condition.

You arrive at Evan’s place feeling uneasy.  You enter through his backdoor without knocking as you had several times before and nearly crash into Tim who is standing inside the kitchen doorway.  Running into the large black man feels like hitting a brick wall and you go bouncing off, nearly hitting the floor, your pain mostly averted by Tim’s quick movement and huge, supporting arms.  For a brief moment you realize He is holding partially by gripping your asscheeks.

You regain your balance and apologize.  

“Hey Taylor!  Welcome back.”

“Hey...uh, Tim, how’s it going?”

“Great!”

You BS with Tim for a couple minutes.  Luckily, Tim doesn’t seem to mind that you crashed into him. He is a sturdy guy so you doubt you injured him.  You thank him for catching you and head upstairs to Evan’s room.

[[Head to Evan&#39;s room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="223" name="Suck Evan off.....again" tags="" position="2501,12694" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocksuck2.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You find yourself zoning out as you bob up and down on Evan’s cock.  It is strange to think about it, but already your movements have become somewhat routine and practiced.  //An unfortunate guy...gal...whatever I am...can get used to anything it seems.//

//No sense doing things half assed either.//  Your father always used to say: “If you&#39;re going to do something, do it right,” although, he probably didn’t think his son would ever apply his advice quite in this fashion.

You stroke Evan’s cock as you suck him, coaxing precum from his manly parts and into your waiting mouth.  You look him in the eye and watch him squirm.  As soon as you add a swirling tongue, Evan grunts, pulls free and unloads a hurricane of semen all over your face.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhh…..” Evan slumps over once he is finished, looking somewhat like a deflated balloon.

[[Let your friend&#39;s semen drip off you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="224" name="You withdraw your hand from Evan’s crotch." tags="" position="2698,11041" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumhand2.JPG&quot; width=&quot;960px&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
Evan&#39;s thick, milky-white sperm covers your hand.  You try and figure out where to dispose of it but there is no obvious choice.  You stand up and try and move in the direction of the bathroom while Rhea keeps laughing at your embarrassment.

You wash the semen off your hand but it stubbornly clings to your fingers.  Even after using soap and hot water, you can still faintly smell Evan’s scent on your hand.

You sheepishly return to the group.  Rhea whispers something to Sam and they both giggle in your general direction.  Sam, the girl you had idolized for years, had just watched you make out with and jerk off your best friend.  You find that you cannot even look her in the eyes. 

You look to Evan and he gives you an incredibly creepy, over-eager smile while tapping the chair beside next to him.  The urge to run away overwhelms you.  Flushing with embarrassment, you mumble an awkward goodbye and dash out of the house as fast as you are able.

By the time you get home you want nothing more than to shower and forget the entire night ever happened.

“I am fine, just need a sec---oowww-”  You feel incredibly nauseous.  “I don’t feel so hot,” you admit to Evan.   //Wait...that’s not true…// you correct yourself as feel a near instant fever take over your body.  One second you were fine, the next you are burning up.

“I am going to head home,” you manage to tell Evan as you begin to stumble in the direction of your house.

“Wait, want me to like call an ambulance or help you--”

You cut off Evan’s protest.  “I am //fine//!” you assure him, standing up straight and putting on a brave show.  “Just need some rest is all.”  The strange sensation in your stomach seems to have shifted lower and spread, the levels of pain oscillating between excruciating and bearable.

“I will cya tomorrow Evan!”
“Later, Taylor!”

As you leave the fields, the awful pain returns.  You want nothing more than to fall into bed but fear something is seriously wrong with you.  The campus medi-centre is much closer than your house.

You decide to:

[[Go home and weather the storm]]
[[Go to the campus medical center]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="229" name="&quot;I don&#39;t feel so good...&quot;" tags="" position="3756,2440" size="100,100">
You are soon again overwhelmed by a feeling of nauseousness and sit down in the shower until the water starts to run cold.  When you finally stand on wobbling knees and attempt to towel off, you nearly topple over.  Your fatigue quickly dominates you and you just barely manage to crawl back into bed before passing out, falling into a deep, dreamless sleep.

When you wake up you immediately feel like something is off.  It seems to be morning already, you note with surprise.  You must have slept like you were in a coma.  As you try and sit up, two huge lumps on your chest shift position just as you become conscious of how sore you feel.  From head to toe your body //aches//.  Your bed also feels disgusting and slimy as you free yourself from the covers, as if it had become a gross, human sized cocoon. 

“What in the fuck?” you say as you free yourself and look in horror back at your blankets.  //Even the most unfortunate homeless person wouldn&#39;t bed down in that,// you think with disgust.  Sleeping in a dumpster would have been more hygienic.  

It gets worse (if that was even possible) as you look closer.  Your blankets are stained dark brown, and seem to be covered with small hairs and a sticky reddish resin that reminds you uncomfortably of vomit.

Your next shock is when you look down.  Two perky, large appearing,  breasts adorn your chest.  A tentative squeeze confirms they are authentic and in fact attached to your body.

Your mind stalls for about ten full seconds.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you can’t help but scream.

//Hopefully the neighbours don’t call 911 -- or maybe they should,// you change your mind as you stumble, bewildered, into the bathroom.

With the greatest trepidation, and a horrible sinking feeling, you gradually extend a hand down your stomach to your pubic region, only to have your greatest fears subsequently confirmed.  Instead of your precious family jewels there is now only an empty void.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorpussy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!” you howl in frustrated rage.  //My diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!//  You didn’t even get to use it properly!  It was like a corvette with five miles on it and now it had been //stolen.//

“Too bad,” Mitch answers, as if your opinion is worth less than dog shit.  “//I// do,” he asserts. ”Let’s be real, Taylor.  You’re high and naked in my room, how are you going to stop me?  If you scream for help I bet you wind up in jail or in a freakshow, I, on the other hand have connections.  I will be out in no time enjoying a beer at a pub while you are being raped in prison.  Besides, look at how far we have gone!  It would be a //shame// to stop now.”

The sheer veracity of his words smacks you like a gauntlet across the face.  You don’t know what to say. 

Mitch takes your silence as acceptance.  Mitch then grabs both of your ankles and pulls you, open legged, towards him.  

“Oh no…” you whimper as Mitch captures you and ogles your exposed genitals while tightly holding your legs.  //Fuck...//  The way he stares at you causes you to squirm in embarrassment.  

A thick finger penetrates you, stirring around the inside of your opening.  Mitch’s fingers stumble upon a spot in the roof of your roof of your vagina and it causes an involuntary spasm.  //Oh god...if Mitch just found my g-spot….yikes…  I don’t even want to fucking think about it!  Ahhh!!//

Mitch leers at you as he pulls a glistening finger from your pussy, a trail of your own fluid following after it like a spider’s web.
Mitch brings it up to your face for you to inspect.  He then pops his finger into your mouth and then invades with two more.  “Suck on my fingers, Taylor,” your tormenter commands.

He starts finger fucking your mouth without waiting for a reply.

“Wuhhh,” you wheeze when he withdraws from your mouth.  Before you can even take a deep breath, Mitch reaches down and rubs your own saliva on your asshole.

“No, don’t do that!”

Mitch thrusts a finger back into your nether regions and then withdraws and adds your feminine juices to your saliva.  Mitch then rubs the fluid on the tiny, tight ring of your virgin asshole, tickling you in a very sensitive area.  As he does so, you cannot help but shiver involuntarily.

Despite the racing pulses of the pink pill, you look up at Mitch and are unable to hide your look of fear.  That look seems to clinch it for Mitch.  He clearly makes a decision as he grins down at you.

[[“Mitch, stop!  NOW!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="232" name="“Mitch, stop!  NOW!”" tags="" position="13160,15795" size="100,100">You shout at him but he just laughs.  With his well muscled arms that you have no chance of resisting against, he grabs one of your legs and flips you onto your stomach.

You squeal in terror as he forces your face down into the mattress, baring your ass for your enemy to enjoy.  

“Please Mitch!  Don’t fucking do this!  I’ll--I’ll-- fuck you, whatever, just... please leave me alone there.  It’s not supposed to--never supposed to happen…”

“What isn’t supposed to happen?&quot;

“You know…”

“Say it,” he commands you as he begins to play with your asshole and vagina.

“I don’t want you--”

//SLAP!// He hits you hard across the top of your left ass cheek and you squeal in pain.

“Who am I?”

“Mitch…”

//SLAP!!// “Show me more respect, Taylor.  We aren’t exactly on equal terms here.”

“Mitchel Schnapps,” you manage to respond, your voice muffled by your position.

“That’s right.  And you, Taylor-Roux are my fucking bitch for life, don’t //ever// forget it!”

“No.”

Mitch laughs in response are marvels at your exposed pussy and ass.  “Ahhhhhhh fuck I love this view.  Never gets old.  I wish I could live for a million years just so I could fuck you every day,” he says, relating some horrible fantasy you will blessedly never experience.

Mitch then proceeds to spit on your ring and you immediately fear what comes next.  

“Please, Mitch, //please,&quot;// you plead one final time.  The weight on the bed shifts, the springs creak, and //something// is pressed against your anus.  You are completely powerless, capable only of squirming and clenching your anus stubbornly shut.

The next instant you are seized by a horrible pain, a foreign sensation that a real man should never experience.  Yet here it is happening to you.  You can do nothing except vainly clench and mewl in disbelief as your most hated foe’s penis penetrates your virgin ass and slides nearly all the way inside with his first thrust.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/analdeep.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

He fucks you with untiring stamina for a long time.  Hours?  Minutes?  You cannot tell.  All you feel is the immensely foreign feeling of Mitch spreading you apart and teasing the warm flesh of your rectum.

With a hand on the small of your back, he repositions you slightly to get a better angle to fit even more of his length inside you.

You feel like you are going to die, to go crazy from the bizarre sensations that are now beginning to creep forward from the area you are joined.

//No….this should be the worst thing ever....it is...and it //isn’t.// Fuck!  I don’t want to fucking enjoy being anally raped by this freak!// 

Yet after a while you do.  The feeling of your having your anus spread and worked gradually shifts from intense pain to something approaching approximate neutral pleasure.  You soon feel yourself go numb, replaced with only a spreading warmth and a yearning from your reproductive organs.  //Have I really become so depraved?//

//No, no, no!// you think as your shaking head is pushed forward into the mattress.  //I can’t stop it...I can’t do anything!  I feel so powerless...//  There is nothing to do but relax and accept your fate.

[[You wonder why the heck this sadistic act doesn&#39;t hurt as much as you expected]]

He slowly begins to work and tease your clit and slit while thrusting into your tight asshole from behind.

He skillfully toys with your bud.  You are now aware of your burning, wet loins, providing a distraction from the discomforting, painful sensation emanating from your anus.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/anal3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mitch suddenly grunts and then begins to pound your ass.  //Hard.//

“Nooo……” you whimper.

“Yessssssss…..” Mitch groans back in your ear.

Every bit of resistance you offer only seems to turn him on further.

//Please stop, please stop, please stop!// gradually shifts to, //Just fucking cum and get it over with before I end up in the fucking hospital!//

“Uhhh…..”  You feel tears well in your eyes but you fight them back.  //I can’t let him see me cry!//  The last remnants of your manly pride are at stake.

//Yet what kind of man am I, really?// you wonder.  Do men have a burning pussy and heaving breasts?  Do they take cocks up the ass for drugs?  You do.

“Ah...Mitch….hnnng….” you squeal as your feet begin to twitch uncontrollably under the awkward motion and muscle strain.

His thrusts somehow accelerate even further until there is just a dull blur of cock ramming up your ass.  With one last deep plunge inside you, you can’t help but tighten up as Mitch begins to cum, his huge, pulsating dick forcing you open even more as he thoroughly seeds your female colon.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchcuminass.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//SLAP!//  Mitch strikes your ass so hard it snaps you of your depression for a second.  “See ya next week, Taylor!” he says to you cheerfully.  “I will take care of everything you need.”

You stumble out of his bed on shaking legs.  Your anus is so sore that you now walk like you have just finished a bull riding competition.  //Ah, fuck...maybe I have...//  A probing finger rubs against your asshole.  When you inspect it you find it glistening with cum and small dirty flecks.  //Eww...//  This moment is the absolute worst, the lowest point you have experienced in your life.  What you have just just done was far worse than everything that has happened to you so far.

You look over at Mitch, standing naked before him.  He is grinning ear to ear, his wet, spent cock flopped over oh the edge of his thigh.

You want to yell at him but you just find that you have no words.  You are just //done.//  Even a thousand pink pills couldn’t make what just happened right. 

It hurts to dress; getting your panties back on requires a grimace of endured pain.

Your walk back home is necessarily slow and awkward.  //I am a man...in a woman’s body...and I just took a fucking cock up my ass!// you think with disbelief, yet the pain and cum dripping from your still gaping asshole reminds you that it is all too real.  You have now taken Mitch in all three of your holes and feel utterly used.

[[Stagger home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="237" name="You feel a building pressure deep within you..." tags="" position="2504,13595" size="100,100">As Evan fucks you, a change gradually seizes your body.  At first you were disgusted and annoyed, passively receiving his cock.  Yet now a warm glowing feeling is pervading through your senses.  A part of you wants desperately to enjoy that feeling, to seize and expand upon it.

To your dismay, you notice you are rocking slightly in time to Evan’s thrusts.

//This is so fucked up and wrong!  But why the hell does it feel so fucking good?  Damn!   Damn!  DAMNIT!//

“Uhhhnnn!!” you moan as Evan suddenly returns to deep penetration.  He completely pulls out of you and then goes balls deep in you, stretching your opening to its limits.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhh!  Aiiieee…..ow….Ow!.Mhm… Uh...uh uh….”

You are about to shout out in pain, just as Evan withdraws, pulling his dick back to the entrance into your vagina.  With his momentary absence you suddenly feel empty, a soft yearning emanating from deep within your groin.

Evan then plunges back into you, the pace of his thrusts quickening until you are biting your lip to keep your voice in check.

You turn back to Evan and can just barely make out the silhouette of his sweat covered figure humping you.  You have a moment of introspection: //So this is what it feels like to lose my virginity as a girl….to my fucking best friend Evan.  Wow.//  This is definitely something you will remember for the rest of your life.  A month ago the odds of this happening would be a hundred trillion gajillion to one and yet here you are taking your friend’s cock inside your pussy and gradually becoming accustomed to it.  There was actually a point that you reached a while back that you knew you had crossed over the threshold of pain and discomfort to a glimpse into the potential pleasures of a woman.

“Ah, ah, ahh...E-Evan…” You can feel pressure beginning to build inside of you.  //I am not going to cum!// you tell yourself only to realize moments later that you might not have any choice in the matter.  It just feels too damn good.  //If Evan keeps going like that I am...I am going to…//

“Noo….” you let out a feeble protest as your inner walls grasp Evan ever more tightly and push you over the edge.  The most intense orgasm of your life washes over you, leaving behind a lingering feeling of euphoria.

You bury your head in the pillow in front of you, too embarrassed for words.

[[Continue your passionate night with Evan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="238" name="Go greet Mitch" tags="" position="3944,3792" size="100,100">“Hey!  Mitch, what are you doing here?” you call out to him, your voice dripping acid.

His eyes light up as you approach.  “I can’t believe this is real.  Same house and everything!  You know, I wasn’t really sure….  You really are Taylor, aren’t you?” he asks you.  You detect a hint of unusual nervousness in his voice.  “Taylor Roux?”

“Why are you here?” you tersely demand, ignoring his question.

He licks his lips before responding.  “I needed to make sure it was really you first.”

“Why?”

“Because I want to go out on a date with you,” he replies bluntly, as if it was the most normal and obvious answer in the world.

//What!?//  His statement suddenly hits you like a sudden car accident.  Fifty seven cars pileup in your mind.  You just stare at him, open mouthed, unable to respond for what seems like ages.

“Please,” he implores you.  “Just one date.  Give me a chance!  That is all I ask, and then I will leave you alone, forever if you want.”

He seems to be waiting for a response.  The idea of going on a date with Mitch is analogous to a tap dancing lobster riding a unicorn in space, both are absurd, impossible images.  You are well aware Mitch is more than a tad crazy and obsessive but you are also aware, despite his thuggish nature, he does tend to keep his word.  He is surprisingly honourable for a crook.  It might actually be less problematic to go for a coffee with him and then blow him off for good after that.  Nobody has to know it ever happened.

Still, the thought you are even considering this likely means your transformation has inflicted a severe mental handicap upon you.

[[No fucking way!  Not a chance in hell!]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="Try and snap out of it" tags="" position="3805,4612" size="100,100">From your vantage on the toilet, you look up at Mitch with drunk confusion, blessedly unable to make complete sense of the impending danger of the scenario unfolding around you.  With a few tugs, Mitch pulls your jacket off and lets it fall behind you over the toilet.  You begin to lean back against the white fabric when Mitch pulls you forward and begins fumbling with your shirt.  Soon he pulls your top loose and then off completely, right over your head.  You blink your blurry eyes as the flash from his camera phone surprises you.

“Taylor your tits are fucking amazing!” Mitch exclaims gleefully as he takes in your chest and all its glory.  Mitch then begins to grope your breasts with abandon.  He slowly teases your nipples and kneads your soft flesh with his iron hard grip.

Despite this being fucked up and you not wanting it at all, it isn’t long before you are both panting.  It is hard to deny that it feels good to have someone fondle your breasts, even if it is //him//.  Such an admission pains you.

“Oww!  Oww!  Ouch that hurts.  You are too rrrough!” you complain, as your head lolls backwards, giving you a great view of the stall’s ceiling and fluorescent lighting.

“Aii!” you squeal as Mitch’s hands find their way between your legs.

“No way!  This is unbelievable.  Not just the breasts, the face, the lips, the hair, the hips, the tight ass...and to top it all off...you have the cutest, most perfect little pussy as well!  Wow Taylor, you really are a woman!  A //fine// woman.”

His hands continue to roam over your body until he has squeezed and fondled nearly every inch of you.

[[The nightmare continues]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="240" name="Complete the blackmail bargain" tags="" position="13015,10793" size="100,100">
Seeing no alternative, you tentatively extend your tongue and are greeted by a tang of salt and a sharp intake of breath from Mitch as your tongue presses against the soft, springy flesh of his glans.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchsucking.JPG&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhh yeah that feels great.  Put it deeper in your mouth.  Don’t half-ass things Taylor!  Remember, I said a //good// BJ, so do it properly.”

It is absolutely humiliating and disgusting but you soon become somewhat accustomed to the movements.  Mitch’s penis is so large you can’t get very much of him inside your mouth at one time so you begin to focus on his head, eager to get the terrible night over with.

You grab his dick and are shocked at how small your hand is relative to his cock.  //Is he that big, or am I just that small?// You wonder.  //Maybe both,// you realize.

[[You begin to jerk Mitch off...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="241" name="You begin to jerk Mitch off..." tags="" position="13165,10845" size="100,100">
“Use more tongue...uhhh yeah…” Mitch requests with a grunt.  You oblige him, lapping up the sour, salty taste.  “Right like that...uhhh…yeah uhhh, perrrrrfect!” Mitch moans.  “Now lick the underside and cup my balls,” he instructs you.  You find yourself acquiescing to his request with surprising meekness, eager to get the horrible ordeal over with.

After about a minute, Mitch begins to breathe heavily.  His cock is starting to twitch in your mouth.  The amount of precum keeps increasing.  Your mouth is a salty, slimey mess, your mind an equally chaotic mess of conflicting emotions, feelings, and sensations.  Mitch is obviously getting close.  //Finally//, you think, eager to get this horrible business concluded.

Mitch grabs the back of your head and forces your forward until you gag on his cock.  He then proceeds to fuck your mouth as if it was a pussy.

“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Mitch moans as he reaches his limit and his cock begins to spasm and erupt, filling your mouth his repulsive cum.  He ejaculates for a full thirty two seconds, you count in a failed effort to detach yourself from the moment.  In the end, the information disgusts you nearly as much as the revolting cum that now fills your mouth and dribbles down your chin.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="242" name="You cannot believe what just happened to you" tags="" position="13016,10934" size="100,100">What you have just done bends your mind.  You have sacrificed a lot of pride and a part of yourself you know you will never get back.

Above you Mitch shudders and basks in the afterglow of his orgasm with a blissful expression on his face as he looks down upon you.

You resist the urge to gag as you are suddenly overwhelmed by the foul taste in your mouth. Mitch’s viscous, milk coloured semen is salty, tangy, and a little bit sour with a strong hint of fishiness.  All combined with the consistency and appetizing value of snot.  It was absolutely revolting and you instantly turn to spit it out but are stopped when Mitch’s huge hand is placed firmly on your cheek.

“Don’t you dare!  A good blow job always ends in a swallow or facial.  It is already in your mouth.  Don’t waste it, Taylor,” he advises.

You flash him a look of pure murder but a strange, burning compulsion and a nagging feeling that Mitch would somehow try and cheat you pushes you to make the attempt and acquiesce.  //I don&#39;t know if I can do this…I am going to puke!//  It takes everything you can muster to work up the sinful courage to swallow Mitch’s sickening seed.  //Anything to get this over with… I am so close, I don’t want him to find a bullshit reason to back out on the deal,// you reason.  So, with great effort, you steel yourself.  A drop of semen falls from your lips as you point your face upward and try and swallow.  //There is so much of this creep’s cum in my mouth…//  You can’t help but note the volume is crazy.  It was truly a massive load, a literal mouthful that you struggle to choke down.  With immense willpower, you manage to slurp it down in several big, disgusting gulps.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchsw.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Huuaahh…”  //Mitch’s semen is in my stomach and traces still stain my lips.//  You know with absolute certainty you will remember this foul taste for the rest of your life.  The putrid flavour and experience was so distinct and disgustingly memorable.  You feel horrid and completely dead inside.  You have seriously crossed the line with this and you immediately regret your decision to agree to any of Mitch&#39;s demands.  //I am so stupid…//  You nearly begin to cry.  You have been completely sullied by the person you detest the most.

You think that nearly any outcome would have been better than this.  //So what if he would have posted the pictures?  HE was the rapist.  He was in the wrong!  And I submitted to him.  What the fuck is wrong with me?

At least this is over with….//

Mitch sees you eyeing the bong and pushes a lighter towards you.  You pick it up and position yourself over the bong’s mouthpiece.  You take a deep breath and look at Mitch, who is now watching you with amusement.  Unsure of what to do, you realize there is probably some sort of test here.  He is waiting to see what you do and how you react. //Will I roast the whole bowl and launch myself into oblivion or cough for an hour from a wisp of smoke?  Will I shotgun the beer or sip on it?// you muse.  A few of your more alcoholic friends would often start a night of partying with pre-drinking.  The more you drank, the more of a man you supposedly were.  You don’t have that much experience with drugs, but you assume it is the same sort of mentality.  You recall that these types of implements //hit hard.//  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bong.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You try and burn through the entire bowl in one go. Your lungs fill up with the sweet, tangy smoke until they can hold no more and you are forced to violently expel it.

After coughing for a couple minutes as the smoke dissipates around the room, you immediately begin to feel…//euphoric//.  The world and all your troubles fade away completely.  

You hear a bubbling sound as Mitch smokes a bowl as well, and a fresh cloud of smoke soon blankets the room.

[[Get it over with]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="244" name="Look at Mitch&#39;s leaking dick" tags="" position="13158,11290" size="100,100">You look at his rock hard penis and spontaneously accept the challenge, thinking, //“He can’t //really// be that far away.”//

As if reading your thoughts, Mitch smiles and sets his phone down.  “Go,” he says as he presses the stopwatch button.

As soon as he pressed that button it was like a trigger also went off in your mind.  You began to suck, lick, and stroke like never before.  You do your absolute best to pleasure Mitch and give him your best porn star impression.

Your actions seem too sensual, too intimate for this creep.  You hate it but at the same time you know you have to hurry.  //Two minutes and thirty seconds.  Fuck!  I have to go faster!//  You feel so conflicted as you glide up and down his shaft, doing your best to make Mitch cum as soon as possible.  //If he wants a good blowjob, I will fucking give him one and be done with it! // As soon as you make that mental declaration you feel ashamed but the sensation is quickly washed away as your teary, glazed eyes flit around the room and come to rest on Mitch’s own.  As soon as you look him in the eye you sense his cock give an almost imperceptible twinge, growing every so slightly larger. // I have him now!// you think triumphantly as your tongue swirls over Mitch&#39;s leaking cockhead.

You feel warm and fuzzy, like your vision is tinted by clouds.  As you shift off the couch and reposition yourself by kneeling between his legs, you find that your shame and revulsion have faded away.

You suddenly realize the scenario is actually kind of funny.  What a fucked up world!  You giggle at Mitch’s bulbous cockhead as it winks precum at you and you eagerly lap it up.  You grip and pump Mitch’s shaft, marvelling it is size, its hotness and hardness.

//It is a pretty impressive cock//, you cannot help but admit.  //Wait.  What did I just think? // You blink and mentally slap the thought away.  //I don’t like cocks!//

Yet you feel a strange yearning from deep between your legs.  //Am I enjoying this?  No fucking way!//

With every moan you increase your efforts.  Soon you are massaging his cockhead and pumping his dick like a madwoman.

[[Aahggh!  What the heck am I thinking!?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="246" name="Aahggh!  What the heck am I thinking!?" tags="" position="13155,11453" size="100,100">Suddenly Mitch forces you away and takes control of his own pleasure.

“I am cumming!” he announces as he begins to jerk off directly towards your face.  You tap the centre of the phone, confident you completed your objective.  //There was no way that was more than three minutes!  I win! // You even manage a half assed smile over your petty triumph as you stick out your chin and wait to receive Mitch’s load.  //And if he cums on my face that means I don’t have to swallow this gross crap.//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/cumonface.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!   Taaaaaaaaylor OHHHHH!” Mitch moans as you are hosed with so much cum your first instinct is to laugh.  It is more comical than disgusting.

It takes Mitch several long moments to recover.  “Three oh two!” he finally says with a laugh, holding up his phone’s stopwatch.  “You’re improving Taylor but still need practice.  You will get there one day soon though with my help.  Taylor, you clearly very talented when it comes to pleasing a man.  I will see you tomorrow, same time.  Don&#39;t be late.”

//Fuck!  Why did I give in again.  Why did I smoke the fucking weed? Agggh!  I got caught up in the moment and I somehow lost track of time.  I can’t fucking believe how happy I was when I thought I had won that stupid bet.  Fuck, what the hell has happened to me?  What kind of person have I become?//

[[Later on...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="247" name="You feel caught up in a moment of madness" tags="" position="13020,11699" size="100,100">You know you are running out of time and that you have to hurry.  Your mind becomes foggy, a series of disconnected images.  Mitch’s cock.  Your face mashing into his pubes.  A meaty shaft burying itself into your mouth.  Your eyes meeting Mitch’s, his face warped with pleasure from your actions and the power he commands over you.  The next thing you know, Mitch begins to shoot at least a dozen spurts of semen all over your mouth and face.  You can do nothing except dumbly accept his load.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminmouth3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Five minutes, twelve seconds,” Mitch laughs gleefully as he positions the phone towards you.  “Nowhere close.”

“What?  That took longer than last time!  How could I have gotten worse…?” you wonder as you wipe Mitch&#39;s pungent seed from your lips.

“Oh, babe, you haven’t.  That was pretty decent.  It was actually the best so far. It probably didn’t help your cause much I already jerked off twice today after I gave those pictures another look over!”

“That’s dirty!” you object.

“No, my cum covering your face is dirty.  And //so// fucking hot!  Hahaha!”

“The pictures…” you say the words in disbelief.

“A deal is a deal.  Although I could let you off the hook for a fuck,” he suggests.

“A //fuck!?//  Are you completely insane?”

“Completely sane and completely in control.  It was just an idea.  We could always just make this a regular thing if you want.  I don’t see what the big deal is, you’re obviously a huge cum-slut!  See ya tomorrow Taylor, you can let yourself out.”

You rise and stand on shaking legs.  You feel like your life has completely unravelled.  Somehow you have become so desperate and completely lost control of the situation.  You keep sacrificing yourself and are still being blackmailed.  If anything your circumstances have worsened. You feel like a miserable shell of yourself, almost like you have transformed into an entirely different person in only a couple weeks.

[[Do some &quot;research&quot; to improve your skills]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="248" name="Resist the urge to murder him" tags="" position="13158,11883" size="100,100">You are silent for a long moment, your thoughts a conflicting storm.  You want to beat Mitch within an inch of his life.  You also want to run and hide.  And a pathetic, very small part of you wants to kneel in front of him.

“You are going to keep your damn word,” you say as you run your soft fingers over his groin.  You slink over the side and undo his belt, letting his pants fall with several gentle tugs.  You can see his bold erection tenting his boxers, with a large wet spot of precum marking the outline of his head.  You laugh, almost a giggle, and give Mitch the biggest fake smile you can muster (the opposite of your internal rage) and slide his underwear down.  

With his massive penis before you, you are forced to commit.  You don’t waste any time.  You begin to worship Mitch’s cock. // No, not Mitch’s cock,// you tell yourself, just //a// cock.  You try and put last night’s homework to use.  You let all thoughts fade away and focus only on the dick in front of you.

Mitch can barely contain his reactions.

You are about to brag about your research the previous night but think better of it.  

“Uhhhh!   Uhhh!  Oh Taylor!” Mitch moans.  “That is fucking pro!”

Suddenly Mitch begins to tense, then his whole body, including his cock begins to spasm.  He begins to erupt all over your waiting tongue and lips. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminmouth2.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As he cums, Mitch grabs your head at the last moment and impales your head on his manhood with a moan of joy.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deepthroat.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After a solid half minute of convulsing down your throat, he finally lets you loose, falling limp on the couch while appearing dazed and out of breath.

It takes you a few moments to catch your own.  “Well?  Going to try and lie and say that wasn’t good?”

Mitch’s head lolls over to look at you.  He looks bewildered.  “No, I won’t lie,” he says after a moment.  “That was the best head I have ever gotten in my life.  Taylor, you are an incredibly gifted cocksucker.”

[[Ignore him and conclude transaction]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="249" name="Look at the new message" tags="" position="13156,12192" size="100,100">“Let’s meet to discuss this,” it reads.  “My place 7pm Friday.”

You take the message as an ultimatum.  //Friday or else!//

Eventually, after much internal battling, you decide that if you make a clear deal with no ambiguity Mitch is likely to keep his word.

But that still means spending another night around him not to mention what you would inevitably have to do with him.  //Am I really considering having sex with Mitch?//  Having sex as a woman would feel wrong.  You’re a man, at least on the inside.  What happens if, god forbid, you enjoyed it?  And how would you reconcile the fact that your first real sexual experience would be with be a man, let alone //him?//

But no matter how much you rack your brain, there isn’t any other way out that you can see.  You have trapped yourself within Mitch&#39;s web with your own actions and naivety.  It is Mitch’s fault too of course, but you feel that blaming him for your trouble is a bit like blaming a rabid dog for its temperament.

[[Decide what to do]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="250" name="Drink more" tags="" position="13157,12351" size="100,100">Mitch flips on some music station on TV and starts talking randomly about things he had seen lately that pissed him off.

He starts talking about someone he was supposed to meet for some kind of shady deal.  They waste all week trying to arrange a meeting.
“...and then this fucking guy just walks across the street in front of me like he owns the whole city!  Cars screeching’ to a stop all around him, making a huge scene.  Fucking unbelievable.”

“Hah!  What an ass!” you yell in reaction to his story, surprising yourself with how drunk you sound, along with the fact that you were even paying attention to his story in the first place.

“Sounds like you need a refill, Taylor.”

You look down at your glass again and are shocked to see it empty.  //It is because it is so damn hot in here!//  The sweet, icy drink just slides down too easily.

You realize you have to pee so you stand up, only to sway and awkwardly attempt to balance yourself.  You feel like you have been spun in a circle for twenty minutes, much like you used to do as a child.

Mitch walks back from the kitchen with another drink and sees you standing by the coffee table.

“Ish there booooze in this?” you suddenly ask him, unable to speak with clarity.

“Yeah, a shit load!&quot; he responds with a laugh.  &quot;Probably about the most alcoholic drink you could possibly have while still enjoying the taste.  Have you never had a margarita or daiquiri before?  There are lots of bottles that just blend in well with fruit and ice.  Vodka, rum, I even got some of that weird sugar cane vodka-like stuff from Costa Rica too.”

You hack and cough as the smoke is forced from your lungs and blankets the room in a thick cloud.

“Holy -fuck,” you manage to say in between fits of coughing.  You were already beyond buzzed but this newest addition has put you in a state of warm bliss.

Mitch chuckles.  “You look comfortable,” he notes.  You feel the weight on the couch shift as Mitch moves towards you.

[[Prepare yourself]]

Mitch begins to tease your nipples, which rapidly become hard enough to cut glass.  “You’re so sensitive,” he comments as he moves his attentions further down your body.  He reaches the waist of your jeans and deftly unbuttons the top.  //Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  This is really happening, //you realize.  //And there is nothing I can do.//  The things happening to you, the events unfolding in front of you are real.  This isn’t some bizarre dream.  No matter how much you wish the past two weeks to be a nightmare you are about to be fucked by reality  //and// Mitch.

You feel your jeans get pulled off your legs and get caught on your feet.  As Mitch tugs them off you lose a sock.  He throws your pants on the floor before feasting his eyes on your almost naked form.

“Oh my god, look at you!  I wish I could take a picture of you right now.”

“Fuck off,” you tell him without missing a beat.

“You’re right Taylor.  It is finally time to //fuck//.  I have been waiting for this for a long time,” Mitch whispers to you as he pulls your panties to the side.  He gives your pussy a light brushing with his fingers.  “Wow you are //soaked,// Taylor.  You clearly want this even more than I do!”

Before you can protest, Mitch penetrates you with another finger.  He rubs your clit with his other hand while his right begins to rhythmically finger fuck you, penetrating up to his knuckle before withdrawing and repeating the motion, like a vibrating hand.

As strange squelching sounds permeate the room, you begin to feel like you are going insane.  You wish Mitch would just get it over with.  Yet he is taking so much time to make you feel good that your disgust is rapidly dissipating.  You didn’t want to have any orgasms tonight, not with //him//.  Yet you reach your second climax of the night with a delirious shiver, riding the waves of pleasure onward until they fade.

“Alright Taylor that’s perfect.  Your pussy is gorgeous.  You’re opening up for me, that’s so kind of you.” Mitch says as he re-positions himself in front of your vagina.  He leans forward and effortlessly lifts you up with a single muscular arm, pulling your panties off with a swish.  Once you are bare before him, he smiles like a champion.  “Spread your legs a bit more,” he tells you and you comply without resistance or complaint.

[[Have sex with Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="253" name="You hate Mitch so much right now" tags="" position="13012,13198" size="100,100">It feels like Mitch is trying to pull a fast one over you.  Yet you have already had sex with him, so you envision whatever line you had was long since crossed.  “Wait a sec.  That isn’t fair.  No, the uh, the agreement we had…”

“Was for one night,” finished Mitch.  “Now let’s try some different positions,” he suggests.  “How about doggy next?”

You are mortified when he easily slides a condom onto himself in one fluid motion while leaping back onto the bed.  He takes you with him, grabbing you roughly and rolling you onto your stomach.

//Swaatt!! SLAP!//  Mitch slaps your ass and then pulls your lower body towards himself.

“No…” you manage only a faint word of feeble protest before Mitch mounts you.  His huge phallus lances into your undefended, tight pussy from behind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchdoggytoomuch.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uhhhhhhgnnngh,” you gasp as Mitch thrusts his entire length inside you, much deeper than he had previously.  You have never felt like this before.  You are full to the brim with this asshole’s cock inside you.  //Again.//  Deep inside you, Mitch stirs around his previous load.  You feel internal sensations that feel strangely foreign.  As he seeks his pleasure, Mitch’s cockhead flirts with an opening deep inside you.  Each thrust penetrates with greater ease and depth than the last.  Soon Mitch’s pace increases, no doubt aided by your juices that flow unbidden down your thighs.  Mitch picks up speed and you feel yourself moving in a different direction, the pain and pleasure were no longer separate, they were now one.  It hurt so much but also felt so fucking good at the same time.  You hate what Mitch is doing to you and the fact that it feels amazing tears a hole in your soul. You have never felt anything like this before in your life.  //This is a woman’s pleasure!// you realize with a sense of amazed horror as Mitch thrusts inside you repeatedly, seeking his own pleasure.
[[Get thoroughly fucked by Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="254" name="Get thoroughly fucked by Mitch" tags="" position="13161,13248" size="100,100">His stamina seems inexhaustible.  Mitch definitely gets the value out of his night.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/condomfuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
By the time next morning arrives, you’ve came so many times you lost count and Mitch has a half a dozen used condoms lined up like trophies next to his waste basket.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/condoms.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You have let Mitch take advantage of you yet again.  You feel ashamed and worthless...and very sore.

[[Reflect on what just transpired]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="255" name="Try and sleep..." tags="" position="13161,13390" size="100,100">You go to bed.  As soon as you fall asleep, you find yourself reliving the night that Mitch ravaged you.  He fucks you endlessly, his untiring manhood penetrating you until there could be no doubt that you belonged to him, at least for the night.  He had used you like a possession and screwed you with obsession.  The weirdest thing of all was that you had felt so good that getting fucked by that degenerate was almost enjoyable.

You awake with start and find your bedding is soaked with sweat.  Your hand instinctively probes between your legs.  //No, that’s not sweat…//  Your hand goes to your panties only to find them soaked through with love juice.  You move them aside and slip them off, only find your new sex to be uncomfortably warm.  //And wet,// you think as you inspect the wet strands between your fingers.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sowet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ewwww!&quot;

[[Think about your dream]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="256" name="Continue the conversation" tags="" position="13018,13650" size="100,100">“I see, uh thanks....” 

“Jerry,” he replies, introducing himself.

“I’m Taylor, nice to meet you,” you reply.  You thank him again for the information and continue to wander around the enormous building.  //Mr Deter has a lab somewhere in here… too bad that he would never help me even if he could.//  You briefly search for Deter’s lab but cannot seem to locate it.  At the end of the day you are exhausted and still no closer to your goal.

With a sigh you begin to walk home.

“Psst!  Hey!” someone calls to you.  It was the man from the bio building.

“Hello,” you say to him.  

“Jerry, remember from earlier?”  You nod, recognizing him from a few hours earlier.  “It is Taylor right?”  You nod again.  “You looked sort of stressed out there earlier.  Did you find out what you’re after?”

“No,” you answer, frowning.

“Well I was just about to blaze here before I go back to the dorm.  Want to join me?” he offers.

You hesitate, but the chance for a free smoke is appealing.  You have seen Jerry around campus, and you are pretty sure he isn’t a serial killer.  “Sure!” you say.  You smile and follow after him.

“Wait, how did you know that I uh... //Partake?//” you ask him.

“Well most people around here do,” Jerry answers.  “Besides my buddy said he has smoked with you before.  He pointed you out.”

“Your...buddy?” you say just as you turn into the alley.  

[[Enter the alley]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="257" name="Keep masturbating" tags="" position="13018,13946" size="100,100">After a another great orgasm, you are about to wind down and call it quits, when your mind wanders and you are reminded about your cell phone.  As soon as the idea is implanted in your brain, you feel your loins start to burn with anticipation.  Even though you know what you are doing is immensely fucked up, you can’t seem to stop yourself.

You sync your phone with your computer and soon have Mitch’s picture in front of you.  You study Mitch&#39;s big veiny cock in detail.  You want to find it disgusting, to turn away and delete it forever.  Yet you don&#39;t move.  You keep staring at it and find, to your ultimate shame, that the sight of his cock has you absolutely //burning//.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dpic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Noooo,” you moan in protest as your body disobeys and your fingers begin to madly pleasure yourself.  Within moments, you are sent rocking, twitching, and thrusting forward as your feminine impulses seize control.  You feel yourself flood with love juices.  As your orgasm fades, you are greeted with a rare moment of clarity.  

“What the fuck is wrong with me?  I have to get this asshole out of my mind.”  You need to get out of the house.  You need to get //laid.//  //Maybe I should just find another guy and satisfy my urges?//  The idea is kind of gross but more than a bit appearling.

[[See if you can find something to do]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="258" name="Give in to your urges" tags="" position="13160,14442" size="100,100">Without further urging, Mitch thrusts all the way inside you, burying his massive cock inside your tiny body. His massive cock kisses your cervix.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fpovsex.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhhh~!”  Fireworks go off in your mind.  This wasn’t at all like last time.  This was the best feeling in the world!

“Fuuuuck me!” you yell, half statement of shock, half suggestion.  Mitch laughs.  He then begins to move slowly before gradually picking up speed.
[[Holy shit, this feels fucking amazing!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="259" name="Holy shit, this feels fucking amazing!" tags="" position="13015,14538" size="100,100">Soon his long, penetrating thrusts are surging inside you.  You feel like you have become unhinged.  You begin to instinctively relax, submitting to Mitch’s pistoning member.  A thousand past faps flash through your mind, none of them holding a candle to this bonfire now raging inside of you.  You then cum so hard you that you flop around the bed, but Mitch holds you down as you twitch underneath him.

“Ohhh fuck!” Mitch grunts, and you can feel his body tense and shudder as he unloads inside you, filling his condom to capacity.  He keeps thrusting until his member softens slightly.  He withdraws his penis from your sex with a near silent pop.  He throws the condom in the trash while you catch your breath.

“You’re so sexy, Taylor,” comments Mitch.  You look over at him, then down at his hard cock, already wrapped in a fresh condom and yearning to be inside of you once again.

Suddenly he slides the condom off.  “Since this is just a dream we don’t need to use protection right?  It feels so much better without.”

You desire more pleasure, to repeat the feelings you just experienced.  You don’t care that this whole scenario is perhaps an unlikely and too vivid dream.  All you can focus on is your euphoric feelings and the hard cock positioned in front of you.

Maybe something has happened to you.  Perhaps the alcohol and drugs have stolen your inhibitions.  All you know is that you desire more pleasure.  
[[You open your legs and spread your pussy open for Mitch.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="260" name="You open your legs and spread your pussy open for Mitch." tags="" position="13165,14589" size="100,100">He accepts your invitation and is on you in a flash, sliding himself inside you with one clean thrust.

He begins to pound your pussy without reservation.  Suddenly he grabs your ass and, with pure brute strength, flips you on top, so that you are suddenly riding him cowgirl style.

Pink lightning coursing through your brain, you begin to bounce up and down on Mitch’s manhood.  He pierces deep inside you and your pussy accepts him, gripping his shaft tightly with your inner walls.  You become aware that you are more in charge of your own pleasure.  //I am on top and in control! // You can change the rhythm, and how deep or shallow the thrusts are.

After a bit of experimentation you find that the quick, shallow thrusts are your favorite.  You ride him in this pattern until you put yourself over the edge.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ride.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhhhhhhhhh!” you moan as you cum.  Mitch revels in your reaction and ejaculates inside you.  You can feel his cock shuddering internally as you continue to ride him through completion.

You fall forward onto his firm chest.  You lie there together basking in the afterglows of your orgasms.

[[Keep &quot;dreaming&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="261" name="This is the best dream ever!" tags="" position="13165,14750" size="100,100">Mitch now has you so hot and bothered that stopping seems impossible.  You see his penis again rise to life between your legs.  On some strange impulse you grab it and slide your slender little hand up and down its length.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchjerk2.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mitch seems to enjoy the handjob and continues to put his own hands to work on your body.  You are forced to let go of his dick and grab the sheets as Mitch again pushes you over the limit.

&quot;Hyyyaahhh!&quot;

You let yourself rest on the bed, panting like you have just run a marathon.  Your body is flooded with endorphins, hormones, and who knows what else.  All you know is that you feel great, everything else seems secondary.

[[You don&#39;t want the pleasure to end]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="262" name="You don&#39;t want the pleasure to end" tags="" position="13020,14851" size="100,100">
Mitch takes his familiar position in front of your pussy.  He places his huge cock on your mons pubis, giving you a great view of his immense size.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchfpovpen.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“What are you waiting for?” you demand impatiently.  Despite all the sex, you still feel hornier than ever.

“Should I go grab another condom?” he asks.

“They don’t seem to stop you from cumming in me!” you angrily protest.

“We don’t need condoms in a dream though.”

“You’re right.”  //This is too damn real to be a dream,// you realize.  Yet you had heard stories of lucid dreaming.  You aren’t quite sure what to think.  There was a small chance this could be a dream - you never remember them anyway.  Everything happening to you could also just be a drug induced hallucination.  //If it is all in my mind then there are no consequences,// you rationalize.

Mitch’s bare cock has found its way to your opening and is slowly being pushed inside.  With a sigh you push forward as well and soon you both join together as one.  You feel complete, happy, youthful, and above all, sexy.  You keep rocking your hips until Mitch reaches his limit, grabbing your ass and pounding your pussy repeatedly until he releases his load deep inside you.

You don’t recall much after that, just disconnected images.  You remember sucking Mitch’s dick and getting fucked from behind but not much else.
[[Wake up from your &quot;dream&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="263" name="Service Mitch" tags="" position="13010,15295" size="100,100">You use one hand to jerk the length of Mitch&#39;s shaft while your other cups and massages his balls.

“Oh my fucking god!  You are unbelievable Taylor!” he compliments you as your mouth fills with salty precum.  After a few moments of moaning, Mitch takes charge, ramming his cock down your throat and cumming inside you until his balls are drained. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deepthroat1.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You swallow every drop as you were told.  Not that you had any other choice.

When Mitch releases you, you fall over gasping for air.  He says he will start making calls looking for what you want.  You leave his apartment with a disgustingly familiar taste in your mouth but at least you saved some money.

[[Walk home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="264" name="You get a text" tags="" position="5148,8757" size="100,100">“Taylor, can we talk before class?” reads a text from Drew.
“Sure,” you respond.  

The next day you show up a bit early to meet Drew.  
“Hey Taylor…” Drew begins with palpable anxiety.  “I-I-...”

“Hey,” you cut him off.  “Don’t say anything.  It is okay, it was just an accident and no one got hurt or lost an eye.  It never happened, okay?”

Drew looksd relieved.  “Okay, thanks for being so understanding!”

Evan then walks up to you and Drew.  “Hey Taylor! ...and Drew.  You guys coming out to party tonight?”

“Tonight is the launch of the //Abandoned Age// beta!” Drew announces with emphasis.

//Oh shit.//  You feel a sudden urge to procrastinate rising inside you.  Fucking //Abandoned Age.//  You have been waiting for that one for years.  It had a development cycle near as long as //King Nukem// and that fucking game took forever to make.  Still, it might be best to Drew a little space for now since to say your last incident made you quite uncomfortable would be the understatement of the year.  You know you should be focusing on finding a cure for your condition but the childish allure of a long sought after game cannot truly be underestimated.

You turn Evan down and accept Drew&#39;s offer.

[[Go with Drew to play AA]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="265" name="Real Roux Path" tags="" position="1902,10591" size="100,100">Under construction!  Maybe next time :P</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="266" name="Go with Drew to play AA" tags="" position="5286,8847" size="100,100">The appeal of //Abandoned Age// is too great to ignore.  You agree to go to Drew’s, although a small, nagging voice in the back of your mind loudly protests it might be a bad idea.

The game is everything you expect it to be.  It is entertaining, fun, well designed, and so deep you find yourself lost within the complicated character development system.  The magic system is pretty badass too.  You send torrents of lightning arcing throughout the screen at every possible opportunity, watching enemies become electrocuted until they burn away as ash upon the wind.

“This is fucking awesome!” you comment.  When Drew doesn’t reply you shoot him a glance and see he is staring autisitically at you.  You suddenly tense and scowl at him but are drawn away by the attack of an ogre knight.  

“Holy fuck!  This thing is a beast!”  It takes you twenty minutes of kiting and barely avoiding getting squished for you to defeat it.  You look back over at Drew and he seems to not have moved in the entire interim.  You roll your eyes.  //At least this game is sweet...//  Drew will probably be a perma-virgin so letting him hang out with a hot girl is probably good for his self esteem.

You play for a few hours without incident until Drew begins to move awkwardly on the couch.  From your peripheral vision it almost look like Drew is...//No, he better fucking not be!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-982.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

You turn your head and shoot Drew a dirty look as his hand snaps away from his crotch and he awkwardly closes his legs.  

“I...have to use the washroom,” he says.  

You give him a disgusted look.

“For real,” he adds while clutching at his fairly large belly.  

[[“Fucking don’t let me stop you!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="267" name="You call Drew." tags="" position="2349,14292" size="100,100">One ring away from voicemail Drew finally picks up.

“Hello,” he answers the phone.

“Hey Drew!  Haven’t heard from you lately so wanted to give you a call and make sure you didn’t die or something.  Anyway, the long weekend’s coming up, you’re coming out to the cabin, right?”

Drew takes an abnormally long time to respond.  Just when you think you must have a bad connection, Drew answers, his voice melancholic.
“I am sorry, I can’t this year,” he says.  

“What!?  Why?  This is our //tradition!//” you protest.

“I just haven’t seen my family in a long time.  My brother is moving to Europe and it will be last time I get to see him for ages,” he explains.  It is a perfectly reasonable explanation but you can’t help but doubt it.  Drew always loved the weekend’s at the cabin and would usually spend weeks planning in elaborate detail.

“Well that sucks!” you huff.

“I know, I am sorry.  I am not feeling very well at the moment.  I’ll talk to you later, okay?”

“Okay, feel better,” you say as you hang up.  You are completely bewildered.  //That really sucks!//

The next moment, reality descends and strikes you like a bolt of lightning.

//I am going to have to spend the whole weekend alone with Evan at the cabin!  Holllllllly shit!//

The fantasy of a tranquil weekend of laughter and relaxation disappears.  The sexual tension between you and Evan is only getting more intense.  Your judgement hasn’t exactly been reliable either.  It doesn’t take a genius to see that going with Evan could lead to some awkward circumstances and potentially serious consequences.  At the moment you don’t really trust yourself, let alone that horndog Evan.  At this point, cancelling with Evan would be somewhat difficult but is probably the right thing to do.

“Uhhh…” you sigh.  Why does everything always have to be so complicated?  If you go, you are pretty sure that you and Evan will end up having sex...again.  Things are already out of control between the two of you.  Still, spending a &quot;romantic&quot; weekend at a cabin is just an all round terrible idea if it is just the two of you.

//And sex with Evan does feel pretty good...//  You sigh.  //What the hell am I going to do?//

[[Agree to go with Evan to the cabin]]
[[Do the responsible thing and cancel the trip]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="268" name="Agree to go with Evan to the cabin" tags="" position="2500,14343" size="100,100">For some reason, when you look at Evan’s dopey face you can’t bear to snuff out his childish glee.  

“I will go with you to the cabin,” you inform your friend.

“Fuck yes!  Thank you Taylor!  You will not regret it--we will have //sooooooooo// much fun!&quot;

//That’s what I am afraid of…//

The next few days pass in a blur.  Before you know it Evan arrives to pick you up, his tiny car packed to the roof with random camping gear.

“Hey Taylor!” Evan greets you.  “I got us some good beer, smores, sausages cooked over a fire --ahh this is going to great!”

You haven’t even begun to fully voice your concerns and already you feel awkward and obligated to go.

As you heft your small backpack and climb into Evan’s car, you feel you are truly going down the path of no return with your old friend.  //Oh well...friendships evolve!//  You figure you will probably have a lot of fun this weekend...and potentially a lot of sex too.

[[Drive to the cabin]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="269" name="Do the responsible thing and cancel the trip" tags="" position="2205,14350" size="100,100">under construction.  Personal responsibility is hugely over-rated anyway.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="270" name="Drive to the cabin" tags="" position="2353,14443" size="100,100">The drive is fairly lengthy but luckily it is a scenic route.  You enjoy the view out the window as you travel up the foothills into the mountains.  You hit the highway and cruise for an hour.
Evan fiddles with the radio dial but finds nothing to his liking.  He then tries to fiddle with your dial, ungracefully rubbing your crotch.
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; you protest and slap away his hand.
“Hey, Taylor...how about some //road head?”// he suggests.
“I am not sucking your dick while you are driving, that is fucking dangerous!”
“You know what is also dangerous?  Being distracted by a hot chick and a boner while driving!” Evan counters.
“What the hell, man?”
“It will help the journey go by quicker…” Evan says as his right hand again shoots across the divider and lands between your legs. “C’mon, please?” Evan pushes you while rubbing your groin.
You want to tell him to fuck off...but you are already too warm to argue with him.
Evan seems to realize he has won you over.  “Thanks, Taylor, you are the best!” he says to you as he pulls his cock loose.
You awkwardly extend your left hand and start jerking him off.
“Ohh that feels so fucking good!”
“Shut up Evan!  Keep your eyes on the road.”
Eventually you find your unoccupied hand has a mind of its own.  You soon put it to work, pleasuring your pussy. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/carbreak2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900px&quot; height=&quot;675px&quot;&gt;
 //Oh my god...this is going to be a loooong weekend...//
Soon both of your hands are drenched with love fluids.  You use some fast food napkins to towel off.  You cannot help but wonder that if Evan is already this horny while driving...how will he be when the two of you are alone at the cabin?
//Wow, this was such a bad idea...//  The scary part is you pretty sure you will enjoy it...even if Evan has more fun than you.

[[Finish the drive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="271" name="“Fucking don’t let me stop you!”" tags="" position="5147,8904" size="100,100">Drew waddles off, leaving you staring at your character’s death screen.

“Aw fuck, I died!?  What the hell?  Fucking shit game!” you yell at the screen.  

After a few moments you sigh and find yourself suddenly feeling self conscious.

You look down at your unfamiliar breasts and sigh.  //These damn things keep distracting everyone!//  Yourself included.  

You sigh again, stand up, and walk around Drew’s living room, looking at the random nick-nacks and clutter.  You pace around a bit and suddenly recall seeing a missed message from your mother a few days earlier, something about an email.  You walk into the small room that contains Drew’s PC lair and see that the computer is turned on and doesn’t appear to be locked out.

You bite your lip as you estimate your phone’s approximate position, buried somewhere in your backpack left at the entrance on the other side of the house.  //Well I am here...still, Drew is a bit anal sometimes….//
[[Use Drew’s computer]]
[[Respect his privacy]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="272" name="Use Drew’s computer" tags="" position="5843,9156" size="100,100">You decide to take a quick peek at your email on Drew’s PC.  You’re great friends so he probably wouldn’t mind if you used his computer for a bit to innocently check your email.

You go to click on the internet browser but in the motion the mouse cursor goes over a bizarrely positioned folder just off the center of the screen.  The folder is named merely, “Hot.” Your cursor circles around the folder as you debate clicking.

//Click-click.// You open the folder.

There are tens of thousands of pornographic images inside.  You shake your head in disbelief.  //Fucking every guy is a pervert--no exceptions!// you think with amazement as you curiously scroll through Drew’s private stash.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumfet.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

“Wow, Drew clearly [[has a cum fetish…]]”  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="273" name="Respect his privacy" tags="" position="4290,9164" size="200,200">You decide to respect Drew&#39;s privacy.  For all you know he might have his homepage set to some weird porno website.  Learning about Drew&#39;s potential foot fetish isn&#39;t at the top of your to-do list.

You walk across the house and get your phone out of your bag.  You access your email app and scan through the dozens...//Er...hundreds...// of missed emails.  You tap one with the subject &quot;Sandra REALLY needs help with Craig.&quot;

You scan through the email and think, //No wonder Sandra wants help… it must be exhausting to babysit an adult all day long.//

Drew is opening the bathroom door in the hall." tags="" position="5844,9300" size="100,100">“Eww...aghhh...Yiiick!”  You fail to suppress a cringey shiver as you slip back to the living room where Drew is waiting for you.

Drew seemed startled by your appearance from an unexpected direction.

“What were you doing?” he asks.

“Nothing!” you snap, eager to forget the information you uncovered.
You try and return to some entertainment but find your mind to be filled with uncomfortable images.  You find even sitting near Drew makes you feel almost ill.

A short while later, your awkwardness meter explodes and you decide to bid Drew goodbye.

With enough weirdness and gaming for the day, you note that it is getting late and stand up with a yawn.

Sensing your intent, Drew rises too.  “Before you go I also have good news for you,” Drew informs you.  “Look at this,” he says, handing you a piece of paper with some of his difficult to read handwritten scrawl.

“//Hyper Advancements in Advanced Nano Technology, The Singularity of Technology and Transformation, The Cutting Edge Science Behind “Living Forever//”…” you read off the names.  //Wow these do sound promising!//  Enlisting Drew’s help was the best idea you have ever had.  

“Thanks Drew, you are fucking awesome!” you tell your friend.  Drew blushes and looks away in embarrassment. 

“Do you think our library at school has these?”

Drew purses his lips.  “I doubt it, these are brand new and considered a specialty.  Two of them were only //just //published and I don’t think they have been peer reviewed yet.”

“Fuck.  That probably means they are going to be really expensive.&quot;  

“Probably,” Drew predicts.

&quot;Thanks Drew!&quot;

[[Check out the books online]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="275" name="Check out the books online" tags="" position="5993,9351" size="100,100">When you get home you search the net and find your fears to be subsequently confirmed.  Getting all of the books on Drew’s list would cost you nearly $1000, money you are pretty damn sure you don’t have.  You find each of the absurdly expensive textbooks - each over a hundred fucking dollars - but decide that the information contained within is probably worth the price.

You check your bank account and find you only have about $500.   You spend an hour trying to figure out which books would likely to be the most valuable.  Some of them seem to be jam packed with data and technical information, which seems like it would be useful.  However, you are pretty sure a lot of it would go over your head, but maybe Drew or someone else could help you make sense of it.  You settle on your top three and complete the online check out...draining your bank account to its dregs in the pursuit of knowledge.

You do feel a lot better at least having a lead.  //Progress!//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="276" name="Buy the three books with the best looking covers" tags="" position="5841,9505" size="100,100">You do the only thing a responsible, intelligent young adult could: you buy the three books with the flashiest covers.  

“Is that a fucking laser?  Wow!  Can’t judge a book by its cover?  Pfft!  I do.  That is probably just some bullshit propaganda written by authors who have crappy covers or can&#39;t afford artists...what a bunch of fucking losers, people don’t give a shit about //text//!”

You see your phone flash.

“Are you going to come over tomorrow for dinner?” Drew messages you.

“4 what? Moar AA?” you type out a reply but stop yourself before sending.

“Oh shit!” you shout in surprise as your eyes dart to the date in your phone&#39;s menu.

“It’s Drew’s birthday tomorrow!  //Fuck!//  I //totally// forgot…”

[[Oh no…..]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="277" name="Buy the three most technical books" tags="" position="6145,9398" size="100,100">under construction</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="278" name="Oh no….." tags="" position="5989,9554" size="100,100">//Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit// you forgot all about it.  Normally you were pretty good at remembering dates but the past week has been pretty hectic, what with your inexplicable transformation into a woman who looks like she belongs in a //Elizabeth’s Secret// catalogue.  //Fuck...what am I going to do?//

Now you have almost missed your best friend’s birthday…. And, to make matters worse, you just spent all your money on //fucking textbooks//…  You are now thankful you torrented copies of your other texts.  //Fucking crooked assholes...goddamn student loans...fucking military industrial complex...Oh shit I am getting off topic here!//
You bite your lip.  You doubt you can do anything about the MIC or your transformation but you might at least be able to think of a thoughtful gift to give to your friend.

//Except I have no money and nothing to give him... //  “Hmm…”  A somewhat obvious but quite perverted idea enters your mind.  //Nothing to offer except maybe myself….maybe.//  The idea is pretty fucked up but you can’t seem to shake it.  Drew has been really helpful lately, and it would be really nice to show your appreciation.  Showing up empty handed is a no-go...//but am I REALLY even considering something lewd like this?//

You feel a tad flushed, so head to the bathroom, nearly tripping over a random box in the hall.  //Fucking Julie leaving her shit everywhere!// you fume as you enter the bathroom and splash water on your face.

“Ahhh...no!  I can’t do //anything// like that!  I am a fucking man!  I have my father’s pride!”

“Now what am I going to do about Drew?  Should I regift or put a little bow on my ass?” you ask your reflection, making a cute little face while pushing out your backside.  “Fuck I am so hot!” you can’t help but compliment yourself as you proceed to make exaggerated kissy faces in the mirror.  //I really need to take a lot of pictures before I change back...//  Fapping to yourself would probably be pretty fucking weird...and potentially hot.  

[[You earmark that idea for later...]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="279" name="You earmark that idea for later..." tags="" position="5840,9655" size="100,100">“I can’t really //do// anything though.  I am not going to strip for him or anything…”  The idea of doing anything sexual with Drew seems quite out of bounds.  The mere idea makes you laugh out loud.  “Yep...//nope!//”  //That is definitely not happening!//

Still, you want to get Drew something //good// for his birthday.  He has seemed a bit depressed the past few months.  More than usual at least.

Most people seemed to forget Drew’s birthday and the loneliness clearly to hurt him.  You know Drew is actually quite spontaneous, gregarious, and confident - but only within his realms of comfort.  Drew was such a hopeless homebody and introvert that you really did worry about him sometimes.

Every year you always make a special point to go out of your way and do something nice for him….yet this year your transformational drama seems to have reduced your memory capacity and messed up your ability to look at calendars.

“Fuck me!” you yell as you again trip over the box in the hallway and carreen into a pile of laundry and shopping bags.

“God damnit Julie!” you curse as you pick up the half destroyed box that you tripped over.  You can see some white and black fabric peeking out from inside.

“No way…” you hiss as you open the box, revealing a stunningly detailed maid’s dress.   “Ewww….!” you mutter with a cringe as you imagine your sister participating in a cosplay night with her boyfriend.

You throw the box down where you will probably easily trip upon it again and head into your room.  You browse the net for a bit but no ideas come to you.  Drew’s family is comfortably well off, and he has nearly every rare piece of memorabilia imaginable.

Your mind keeps searching for some way to get Drew a thoughtful gift that he would really care about.
[[Come up with a gift for Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="280" name="Come up with a gift for Drew" tags="" position="5991,9704" size="100,100">//Hmm...I can’t really think of anything like that.//  “Hm….What does Drew want….” your eyes suddenly fall on your sister’s cosplay outfit.  An incredibly fucked up but brilliant idea occurs you.

You pick up the dress and drape it over yourself.  It seems like it would probably fit quite well, probably a given due to the similarities in size between you and your sister.  Still, Julie did have a slightly larger chest than you.  You hope it doesn’t slip off or anything.
Still, dressing up as a fucking //maid// for your best friend?  That is mega-fucked up, even if Drew would //really// appreciate it.

“Yeah I can’t do this,” you decide, throwing the outfit back into its dilapidated box.  You are Taylor Roux, a man, and men do not dress up in this manner.  //Hmm...except I am not in a man’s body right now….//  Suddenly an idea occurs to you.  “What if I just...//act.//  Holy fuck I am smart!  I always wanted to be on the big screen!  I just have to play a role, that’s it.  I have beaten so many RPGs, what’s a little IRL roleplay? Hah!”  You are a high school drama class veteran.  //It’s perfect.//  Acting is pretty fun, Drew might gain a bit of self confidence, and you don’t even have to buy an expensive gift.  //Maybe this is a good plan after all!// you think, while trying to tamp down a few lingering doubts.

[[Show up at Drew’s with your “gift”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="281" name="Show up at Drew’s with your “gift”" tags="" position="5840,9804" size="100,100">The next day you show up early at Drew’s place.

“Hey Taylor.  You’re early,” he observes while ogling the box you are carrying.  //Or maybe he is ogling my chest...//

“I needed some time to...set up my gift,” you explain, while hefting the box.

“Is that for me?  Oh, Taylor, you are the best!&quot;

“I know…”  //Wait until you see it...er ...me...//

“Come on in!” Drew welcomes you inside.  Once in his living room, you stand there awkwardly holding the box.  A palpable nervous tension seems to pervade the room.  //Ugh, time to bite the bullet and get this over with...//  You really hope you made the right decision with this “maid” idea.

“I will be right back,” you tell Drew as you march off to the bathroom like a soldier off to war.

As you gradually put on the somewhat complicated garment you begin to question your sanity.  But it is already too late to change your mind.  The shoes seem to be the worst part which was something you didn’t quite expect.  You feel like you are on stilts or going to topple over at any moment.  Each step is a teetering act of balance that causes you great dismay.

[[Show Drew your maid costume]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="282" name="Show Drew your maid costume" tags="" position="5987,9854" size="100,100">You stumble out into the hallway on feet unused to such uncomfortable footwear.

“Whaaaaauuhhhhhhhhhhhhh…eeeeeeehaaaaah?” Drew balks, his voice morphing from a question into the approximate sound of someone cumming in their pants.  “//TAYLOR!?//”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-983.jpg&quot; width=&quot;65%&quot;&gt;
“In the flesh!”  //A woman’s flesh...//  You feel an unexpected tingle of excitement.

Drew stares at you in open mouth shock for what has to have been several minutes before he finally is able to speak.  You find his reaction to be highly amusing.  //No one has ever looked at me like that before…// you dryly note.  You slip off the shoes and throw them into the corner, realizing there was no way you would get through an hour of standing let alone a day of mopping floors with those burdens on your feet.

Drew watches your tumbling black shoes with surprise, before his eyes snap back and return to you.

The rapturous, all consuming gaze makes your heart flutter despite your attempts to breathe calmly.

[[Finally Drew speaks]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="283" name="Finally Drew speaks" tags="" position="5841,9956" size="100,100">“It is my birthday,” Drew begins with a long, almost remorseful tone.  “And you’re the only one that really cares, Taylor.  I am glad I get to spend this day with you and the fact that you would dress up for me makes me just so //happy.//  It just shows how great and generous you really are.”  Tears well in Drew’s eyes and, as you look at him, your own moisten in response.  “You know Taylor...  You are my only friend,” Drew sorrowfully admits to you.

The depressing tone hurts you.  //I thought he would be happy!  Fuck.//  “That’s not true!” you protest.  “What about--”

“Evan?  Oh come on.  I don’t think he likes me at all.”

Drew seems to descend into the dark underworld of depression.  You can almost see a stormcloud begin to take form over his head.  It becomes unbearable for you to watch him like that.

“C’mon it is your birthday.  Cheer up, buttercup!” you happily chime, trying to do your best to sound upbeat.  “For tonight is your special day, and this tailor-made Taylor maid is here to brighten your day!” you quip. 

“W-w-what do you mean?” Drew stammers in alarm.

[[Explain your gift]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="284" name="Explain your gift" tags="" position="5991,10009" size="100,100">“I didn’t just dress up for you.  Taylor the Maid is here to serve //Master// Drew,” you explain to him him the biggest, sweetest smile you can muster.

Drew starts to cough, as if choking on his own breath.

“Anything you want I will bring and any need you have I will fulfill because for today~  I am honour bound to obey!”  You even manage a slightly french accent.  //Fuck, I should be an actor...ress….fuck!//
Drew immediately goes red in the face.  His head now looks exactly like an overly ripe tomato.  You almost laugh.  

“Oh come on Drew, get your mind out of the gutter.  I mean I will do shit like clean your floors or make you dinner or something.”

“Oh,” he grunts, sounding disappointed.

“Don’t “oh” me!  What are you, fucking “Evan”?”

“Okay well….let’s start with some of that then.”

“Start with what?”

“The stuff you mentioned.”

“You have to be //specific//.  Please order me, master,” you purr to Drew.  “Or I just won’t know what to do.”

[[Try and cheer up Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="285" name="Try and cheer up Drew" tags="" position="5842,10099" size="100,100">Drew swallows nervously but after a couple deep breaths he appears to gather his determination and prepare himself.  “Maid,” he begins, his voice a mere whisper.

“What!?  I CAN&#39;T HEAR you!  C’mon Drew, I am just your lowly little maid.  You don’t get nervous at the cashier when you go to buy a hamburger every fuckin’ day, right?”

Drew blinks.  “You’re right,” he agrees, sounding astonished at the perceptiveness of your insight.

“So…”

“So you just need to close your eyes and repeat to yourself that I am just a maid and you are my master.  I am just acting-role playing- here, just like an RPG.  You can do the same.  You’re already great at it!”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-984.jpg&quot; width=&quot;65%&quot;&gt;

He appraises you for a moment but then nods at you slowly and then proceeds to follow your instructions.  His eyes close and you watch and listen as Drew awkwardly mumbles away.

“I am the master, Taylor is the maid, I am the master and Taylor is the maid...//my// maid…..I am the maid’s boss...her master...//Taylor’s// master….”  

//I hope Drew learns a thing or two tonight!//  You note he could definitely do with a big increase in his charisma and confidence stats.  Drew repeats his mantra for way longer than you expect him to.  He almost seems to be in a weird, mumbling, meditative trance from what you can tell.  After about fifteen minutes pass, you become quite concerned.  You go to shake him out of it and he wakes from his stupor.  When Drew opens his eyes again there is a different light behind them.

[[Take commands from Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="286" name="Take commands from Drew" tags="" position="5992,10161" size="100,100">“Maid,” Drew says, speaking with almost perfect and unusual clarity.  Drew was a bit of a mumbler but he wasn’t mumbling now.  “Go make me a sandwich,” he orders you.

You give Drew a dirty look and he has the grace to look somewhat abashed.  “Fine, yes //master,// I will be right fucking back,” you say as you scurry to the kitchen to do you “master’s” bidding.  Drew follows you and sits at the kitchen table.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-985.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;

Drew’s fridge is well stocked, //of course it fucking is...//, and you find a lot of ingredients inside.  Even precooked bacon, some deli meats, and many condiments.  A few minutes of sandwich sculpting later, you have constructed a delicious looking clubhouse sandwich which looks like it came from a fucking restaurant and cost thirty dollars just for the sandwich alone.  Looking at the crispy, glistening lettuce and that perfect tower of sculpted, flavoured meat makes you //so// fucking hungry but you suppress the urge to devour it.  //It wouldn’t be appropriate in this “role” I am playing,// you chide yourself.
You serve Drew&#39;s sandwich and he devours it with a look of adulation.  You become even more hungry and jealous of that fucking tremendous sandwich you made as Drew eats it with many, “Mmmms!” and “Ahs.”
After Drew’s lunch, he begins to give you random small tasks, seemingly to test your limits.  You follow his orders and try and do a good job tidying up Drew’s place but its already among the cleanest homes of any young man you have ever encountered.  You find that each order subtly seems to reinforce your own instinct to obey.

[[Continue being ordered]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="287" name="Continue being ordered" tags="" position="5844,10259" size="100,100">“Taylor! Clean over there!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylormaid2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Yes, sir!”

“”Over there!  Those windows are...//streaky//…” Drew informs you.

“Oh no!  We can&#39;t have that!  I am on it!” you reply, grabbing a spray bottle and rag from under the sink.  Drew gives you an irritated look.  //Ooops.//  “Sorry, I am on it, //master!//” you correct yourself with a roll of your eyes.

“Stand on your tippy toes and dust the top on my bookshelves,” Drew orders you once the windows are clean.

“Vacuum under that chair!” he orders you next.  You oblige, your backside plainly on display for Drew’s eyes to feast upon.

“It is my birthday,  I am the master and you //Taylor,// you are just my maid... uh,for tonight at least.”

“Yes, Master Drew!” you say as you go about your tasks, Drew’s eyes never once leaving your figure.

“Go make me a coffee,” Drew orders.  Each command seems to come more naturally from his mouth.

[[Head to the kitchen]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="288" name="Head to the kitchen" tags="" position="5988,10301" size="100,100">“Yes...master…” you answer as you head back to the kitchen.  Drew follows close on your heels like a loyal hound...except now you suspect he hardly means to protect you.

You go to the kitchen and rattle around until you have found everything you need.  Drew watches everything you do and it makes you a bit self conscious as you start brewing the coffee while setting up a serving tray.  //This outfit is so stupid...// you can’t help but think as you notice the lacy frills and the striking juxtaposition of black on white.

Soon the fresh brewed aroma spreads and you grab the pot and pour for Drew.  You are about to pour a second cup for yourself when you stop.  //Maids wouldn’t drink in front of their master...//  You sigh and pour only the single cup for Drew.  You aren&#39;t sure how Drew prefers his coffee so you add a small carton of cream and a few sugar cubes to the edge of the tray.  You then serve “Master” Drew his coffee.

Drew seems almost giddy as you place the coffee before him..  “It needs cream,” he says, pushing his mug forward.  At the mention of cream your dirty mind does a summersault.

“Of course,” you say, picking up the carton.  “Just say “when,” master!” 

The way the costume frames your cleavage seems to mesmerize Drew.  You share a moment where you are both looking at your chest.  As you look over at the cream in hand you can’t help but laugh.  A lame joke involving breasts and milk goes in and out of your mind like a ball thrown through a window.

You start to pour the cream, a thin drizzle that takes ages to change the colour of Drew’s coffee.

“W-when!” Drew shouts as he realizes creamy coffee is now overflowing off the table.

//Well...it is his birthday....and I know he won’t ask but I think he would obviously appreciate a little teasing.  Lord knows he needs it….//

//Still,// you think, //maybe there is a way I can help build up his confidence and repay some of the kindness he has shown me over the years…//  You sigh.  //A really fucking weird way//.  Still, a part you thinks that with a little bit of your help Drew’s life would probably be a lot better.  He’s your best friend afterall, you would do almost anything for him if it meant really helping him out.

You decide to:
[[Tease Drew]]
[[Don’t tease Drew]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="289" name="Tease Drew" tags="" position="5842,10407" size="100,100">Drew’s conflicted and obviously pained expression is just too cute for you to ignore.  You would never consider doing anything like this with Evan or anyone else, but here, alone with Drew, you can’t help but overwhelmed by sexual power and a spark of mischievous spirit.

You decide to tease your friend for his birthday.  You look at the carton of cream and the mostly white stain on the table with a small sigh.  As you errantly recall Drew’s favourite fetish, an idea spawns in your mind.

You would never do anything truly sexual with Drew under any circumstances…  But here? Dressed up like a maid, and on his birthday you could probably get away with a minor once-off favour that he would appreciate until the end of his days.

You smirk as you pick up the cream.

“Ohhh….” you moan and Drew looks up at you with surprise.  “Oh, //Master//  I seem to have made a //mess!//”

You laugh at how big and surprised Drew’s eyes now appear.

You give your best bimbo impression.  “Oooopsy!”you say as you slowly, sensually, pour a trail of cold cream down your breasts and the front of your dress.

Drew’s eyes bulge as the cream pours down your bosom.

“Hhhhhhhhh!” Drew sucks in a rapid, shuddering breath as he watches you in a state of absolute rapture.

His response just encourages you.  Soon you have poured the entire carton all over yourself.  You feel kind of slutty. //But it is all just an act, done in private for a friend...//

[[Put on a maid show for your friend]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="290" name="Don’t tease Drew" tags="" position="6141,10353" size="100,100">under construction...who picks this on their first playthrough anyway?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="291" name="Put on a maid show for your friend" tags="" position="5992,10499" size="100,100">Drew breathes raggedly as he inspects your creamy shirt with an expression of abject disbelief.  You hadn&#39;t quite thought the whole thing through, for now nearly every detail of your breasts is now presented for your friend, clearly visible through the sodden, milky fabric.

“Uhhh…uhhh...” Drew just breathes in and out.  He looks like he is actually having a heart attack.  Just when you are about to call 911, Drew shakes his head and swallows.

“So, what do you think?” you ask, dropping the stupid act.

Drew watches the cream drip off you onto the floor.  As the seconds tick by, each one makes you a bit more uncomfortable.  //Fuck, this was such a bad idea!//

Drew seems to have lost it.  He just mumbles incoherently in response to your question.  

Just when you start to feel bad and that you may have given Drew an aneurysm, you make out what he is saying.  His is repeating his earlier mantra.  “I am the master and Taylor is my maid…” he says, sounding delirious, like he is lost in some kind of mad fever.  Perhaps he was really dying.

“Are you okay, Drew?” you ask out of concern.

He blinks a few times and looks up at you.

“Y-you made a big mess!” he suddenly shouts.

“Hehe, I sure did!”

[[Drew&#39;s brow furrows]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="292" name="Drew&#39;s brow furrows" tags="" position="5840,10560" size="100,100">“This isn’t funny!  You’re my maid and I am your master,” he repeats.  “And now you have made a huge mess.  Clean this up now!”

You look at Drew, unsure whether he was joking, but his smouldering, green eyes appear to be unreadable.

“Yes, I will clean it up right away!” you say, turning away to grab a cloth off the nearby counter.  Before you make it a single step, you are stopped by Drew’s shockingly stern voice.

“No!” he yells.

You turn around and shoot your friend a puzzled look.  You have never before heard such a commanding edge to his voice.

“Come here...and clean this up…” Drew says, while gesturing at the small pool of cream on the table.

“I will!”

“...with your //tongue,//” he finishes his request.

“HUH!?  What!?  What the fuck, Drew!?”

Drew’s face straightens.  “I am sorry Taylor…. I just got a bit carried away with the role playing.  You promising to be my maid tonight...is //awesome,// you’re the greatest friend in the world.  And you&#39;re //my// friend.  I am so lucky.”

You bite your lip.  //That’s right, I did promise….//  It is also quite true you were the one that suggested all this and pushed the envelope in the first place.

You sigh.

//Fine...//
[[Lap up the milk]]
[[Clean it up with a towel instead]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="293" name="Lap up the milk" tags="" position="5742,10754" size="100,100">You sigh.  You’ve already made the commitment to see this through...and put on a show.

“It’s okay master!” you tell him.  “Tonight Taylor the Maid is ready to serve!”

You drape your sexy body across the table, positioning your head over the cream.  Gradually you extend your tongue and lap up the cream like a little kitten.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/milklick.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;

Drew looks like an internet meme representing surprise.  You have never seen his mouth open for so long without food being stuffed inside.  He watches you with an intensity that you have never encountered before in your life.  He makes you feel like...a movie star, the center of attention.  Even though it’s Drew’s birthday, maybe he had given you something as well.  

You smile at your friend as you run your little tongue in a final circle, removing the stain ring from the table completely.

“There!  All done!” you say when you are finished.  “This maid will try and not make any more messes h--she can’t clean up!”  //Reminding him I am fucking dude probably won&#39;t help the illusion here...//

[[.Look at Drew]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="294" name=".Look at Drew" tags="" position="5586,10854" size="100,100">“Uh, Taylor…” Drew wheezes, his voice pained.

Drew then points to the cream you have just spilled on the floor, his gesture a wordless question.  //No fucking way!//

You balk and are about to scream at him when you suddenly realize how important this probably all is to Drew.  He had just confessed some really depressing shit to you and you don’t want to turn down a negative path.  You’re a positive fucking person, born optimistic from the get go.

You sigh as you stare at milk puddle.  You don’t want to do demeaning shit but life was full of such drudgery.  And how bad //really// was licking up some spilled milk anyway?  //Cats do it all the time!// you rationalize.  And compared to working twelve hours on an assembly line, was licking up a bit of cream really so difficult?  

You sigh again as you look to Drew.  He seems to be leaving the decision to you but he is leaning forward eagerly, his eyes afire with interest.  

//Fucking god damnit!  What have I gotten myself into?  I am dressed up like a sexy fucking maid for my best friend’s birthday!//  You suddenly suspect you may need years of therapy when this is all resolved.  
You sigh a third time, conscious how even those sound so different than before.  You cannot even fucking sigh anymore without being reminded you’re a girl.  

You look over at Drew and find your desire to deprive Drew is crumbling.  There was no sense in ruining something special if you could avoid it.  If crawling around for a bit and making a fool of yourself makes your friend happy….well maybe there were much worse trade offs in the world.

[[Am I really fucking going to do this?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="295" name="Am I really fucking going to do this?" tags="" position="5747,10903" size="100,100">More seconds of blistering tension tick on.  You stare at the puddle on the floor, while Drew stares at you.  “Promise you will never-ever tell anyone about this?” you ask to Drew’s eager nods.  “Especially Evan!” you add and Drew&#39;s nodding pace redoubles.

//Fuck me….this is so demeaning...I can’t believe I am really doing this…//

You slowly crouch down to the floor.  The main puddle and its splatters cover several tiles worth of floor….luckily Drew has OCD level cleanliness at his house.  Although you can see a few random pieces of hair and crumbs, the floor is blessedly clean. //Or I would NEVER fucking do this!// you tell yourself.

You glance up at Drew one last time before pressing your face nearly to the tile.  You try and lick up the cream but find there is simply too much and the awkward angle makes lapping it up difficult.  After floundering around for a couple of minutes while failing to do any real damage to the puddle, you get an idea.  //Uhh... I really shouldn&#39;t to do this but ten minutes of torture is better than an hour of agony!//  You suddenly press your lips to the surprisingly cold tiles, as if you were trying to kiss the milk sodden ground.

//“Sluuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!//&quot;

//Hmm...I guess this isn’t as bad as I thought...//  You suppose the “5 second rule” probably applies to spilled milk too.

//Sluuuuurp.//  The somewhat lewd noise echos through Drew’s kitchen as you do your best to suck up the floor cream.

“Yes, yes!” Drew encourages you while kneeling down to get a better look at your handiwork.

With the largest puddle gone, the rest is relatively quick work.  Soon your tongue is giving the tile a final polish and, when the kitchen floor is spotless, you finally rise.  

You now have a pretty funky taste in your mouth, replete with cat hair and bread crumbs.  You want to spit but decide that would be inappropriate while pretending to be Drew’s maid.

[[Finish your maid service]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="296" name="Finish your maid service" tags="" position="5848,11101" size="100,100">The rest of your “service” finishes with some minor chores.  After the cleaning the milk mess, Drew becomes relatively quiet and subdued, although he still watches you eagerly the rest of the night as you go about the random chores he assigns.  

You finish Drew’s remaining requests without issue, although your awkward, wet dress clings to you and makes you conscious of your new body in a way that you haven’t quit experienced before.

It gets late and the night finally wears down. 

“Alright, Drew.  I am sorry to inform you but my contract of servitude has expired,&quot; you inform your &quot;master.&quot;

You decide it would be a bad idea to wear the outfit home so you quickly change, but not before eyeing yourself a bit in the mirror and washing your mouth out.

You look down at the milk sodden maid outfit and feel a pang of regret.  //Fuck I probably need to get this dry cleaned now...//  You hope Julie doesn’t kill you.

As you walk to the door you wait for Drew and say your goodbyes.  “Thanks, for coming Taylor...I know without you I would probably be all alone on my birthday.  You are the greatest friend I could ask for.  So, thank you, sincerely...it means the world to me.”

His words and earnestness embarrass you.  “Heh.  No problem.  All I did was dress up,” you reply.  //And lick cream off the fucking floor….//  You push the memory away.

“Yeah, but you did it for //me.//  Have a good one Taylor!”

“You too!  Happy birthday, //master//” you jokingly call out to him as you leave.  You hope you haven’t gone too far with this whole charade.
“Good thing this just a once off,” you assure yourself.  After all, Drew only has //one// birthday a year.

[[Go home and deal with the costume]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="297" name="Go home and deal with the costume" tags="" position="5992,11163" size="100,100">“Hahahahahahaha!  //You// wore //this//?” your sister, Julie, cackles when you get home. “Oh-my-god, that’s funny!  Did you have a fun time being a cute little maid?”

“No...not really.”  Your sister guffaws even harder at your answer.

“You know what, just keep it.  It’s yours, just wash it before you use it again.” Your sister sniffs the outfit and looks perplexed.  “Hmm, it smells like… //milk//… not //cum,//” she notes with astonishment.

“OF COURSE IT DOESN’T SMELL LIKE FUCKING CUM!” you scream at your sister.

Julie just laughs even harder at your tantrum.

Eventually you calm down and ask Julie if you owe her anything for the rental.

“Oh this isn’t a rental.  I get them from that cool shop on the west side.  I am hot and a frequent purchaser so they always give me a steep discount.  I am good promotion for their business,” Julie adds with a wink.  “But no, you don’t owe me anything.  The joy you have given me is more than payment enough.  I might force you to dress up for me now that I know you’re into it.”

“I am not--”

“I know, I know.  Just keep it, hey?  You never know when you might need to //transform// and become a maid!  Haha...oh wow, Taylor,” your sister gushes, while wiping a tear from her eye.

[[Go to your room and sleep]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="298" name="Go to Mr. Deter’s office" tags="" position="8785,7826" size="100,100">A few minutes later you are standing in front of Mr D’s office. 

You feel surprisingly nervous.  Could your nutty teacher could really be caught up in some ridiculous conspiracy to transform you into a woman...and then ...leave you alone?  Nothing seemed to make much sense these days, so you had to merely pursue any lead you came across while attempting to exercise the utmost caution.

Deter’s motivations were, as of yet, unclear.  You had to learn more.  
You knock on the door.

“Come in!” he calls from inside.

You enter the room and stand before Mr.Deter, who is seated at his desk, idly tapping at his computer.

“Hello Mr. Deter...I have a few questions for you if that’s okay.”

“Sure, anything for a lovely lass like yourself,” he says while shooting you an oily smile.  “Who are you?”

“I am //Taylor//,” you introduce yourself with emphasis, while trying to carefully judge Deter’s reaction.  He disappoints you, for clearly your name means very little to him.

“What can I do for you, Taylor?”

“I am in your psych class,” you elaborate.

He shakes his head no...many times.  “No, I don’t recall seeing you in my class,” Mr. D replies, adding, “I keep rigorous attendance and am familiar with all my students.”

“I can prove it, your lecture this morning was about the Marshmallow Experiment.  A little dry, but I don&#39;t mind lectures about food.”

Mr.Deter looks at you sideways, clearly not //quite// believing you.  You pass over a hand-out from that morning with your name at the top.  Mr. Deter accepts your paper.  He glances over it and his eyebrows shoot up.

“Your name is Taylor //Roux?//” he asks you, sounding somewhat perplexed.

“Uh, yeah…”  //He really didn’t realize it was me...Fuck!  I hope this isn’t another dead end.//

“You have the same name as one of my other, //less impressive students,//” he remarks in amazement at the apparent coincidence. 

//Are you fucking kidding me?//

[[Explain that you are in fact, Taylor Roux]]
[[Shrug and tell him that it is a common name]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="299" name="Explain that you are in fact, Taylor Roux" tags="" position="8632,7881" size="100,100">“No, I am the Taylor Roux from your class...the “less impressive” one you just mentioned,” you explain angrily.  “Now listen up.  I want some answers.  You did something to me and changed me into a girl!” you accuse him.  “Why!?  What the fuck is wrong with you?”

Mr. D finally takes you seriously.  “Your sex was //changed//?  Completely?  Hmmm….”  His eyes light up and you are now sure he had something to do with your transformation.

“Change me back right now you asshole!”

He looks at you with wide eyes.  “I cannot….at least not yet.  What you claim to have experienced was not my intent-I had nothing to do with it-I assure you!” he speaks a little bit too quickly for you to believe him.  “It is merely one of my theories advanced to its logical conclusion,” he goes on.  “If it were not based upon my own work, as a man of science, I wouldn’t entertain the idea of such a radical transformation.”

“Are you the Dr.J. Deter that wrote a paper on “Mechanized Atomic Ribonucleic Restructuring”? you question your professor.

There is another  glimmer behind Deter’s eyes.  “Yes, I am Joseph J Deter.”

“Your name is //Joseph!?//”  //No fucking way....//

Mr. Deter looks at you sideways.  “Yes.  Is that an unusual name?”
“N-no...it’s a, uh, a ...very //manly// name.  I uh...I like it,” you stammer in reply.

Out of curiosity you find yourself asking Mr. Deter why he doesn’t use the “Doctor” honorific.  

He instantly gets pissed off, as if you touched on a sore subject and asked an enormously stupid and very offensive question. 

 “As if I would want to be associated with those //infinitesimally small minded myopic elitist turds!!//” he rants as his hands ball into fists and shake with barely throttled rage.
 
//Ohhh….That makes perfect sense!  He thinks he is better than all the greatest scientists on Earth, I get it...  Mr. Deter is certainly a humble guy,// you sarcastically note.

“I will help you,” Deter suddenly offers.  “And I have everything we need back at my place.”

“Fine, I will come with you--but no funny business.”

[[Go to Deter’s Place]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="300" name="Shrug and tell him that it is a common name" tags="" position="8932,7888" size="100,100">“Uh...yeah, it is a common...French name….there are //millions// of us in back in France,” you answer somewhat sarcastically but Mr Deter nods thoughtfully at your explanation.


Route under construction.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="301" name="Go to Deter’s Place" tags="" position="8784,7979" size="100,100">You are shocked when you see Mr. Deter’s “place.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rv.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“You live in a fucking //trailer//?”

“I am an academic!” Deter explains with obvious irritation, “Teaching is an underrated profession!  I live on a modest salary and everything I make goes back into the cause of bending the world to my--I mean making the world a better place.”

“I...see.”  You vaguely recall something about Mr.Deter recently winning a research grant for a million dollars.  //I guess he really did spend it on research, and then some...//  You do not doubt his dedication.

“After you,” he says while holding the door open for you.

[[Go inside the trailer]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="302" name="Go inside the trailer" tags="" position="8630,8041" size="100,100">Once inside the RV you are even more surprised.  The tiny mobile structure is jam packed with all sorts of expensive looking lab equipment.  There is so much of the stuff it is even piled up next to Mr. Deter’s bed and covers every surface and space.  You don’t even think the RV is operational anymore, cannibalized for every inch of space.

Some of the strange implements scattered throughout the mobile home look kind of scary.  As you inspect a weird tank-like object, you note that you don’t see anything that looks familiar...or particularly useful.

Mr. D beginss rummaging around, finally unpacking a metallic disc shaped ovject that he places on the floor.  It looks somewhat like a manhole cover but is covered with a skirting of copper wiring.  It looks homemade and kind of dangerous.

“What the hell is that?”

“It is just a... scale...a //very// precise one.  Now do be a good girl and hop on,” Deter requests as he connects the disk to a car battery.

You scowl at your teacher.  None of the equipment looks particularly safe...or FDA approved.

“The data I gather might allow me to cure you right here on the spot!”
Deter let that sink in a moment.  You could maybe even walk out of this trailer the way you were before….maybe.  //Mr.D is insane...but is he trustworthy?// you wonder.  

“Well, what is it going to be?” Mr. Deter prompts you.  He is eyeing you eagerly, his impatience evident.

You decide to:
[[Let Deter experiment on you]].
[[Try and figure another way out]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="303" name="Let Deter experiment on you" tags="" position="8789,8122" size="100,100">“Fine, if it well help me change back I will do whatever the heck you need,” you inform your professor.

“Excellent, I //always// knew you were a bright one, Taylor.”  

//Didn’t he call me “less impressive” or some shit earlier?// you mentally fume.

“Let’s just get this over with.”

“Step on to the...scale please.”

With a sigh you step onto the strange object, placing both feet in the disk’s center.  Thirty uneventful seconds tick by.  Just when you think nothing is going to happen, and that the device may in fact really be a scale, you suddenly feel a shock of electricity surge through your body.

A warm feeling pervades you completely until you feel like you are on fire.  Every nerve ending in your body lights up like a Christmas tree.  Just as you are about to scream in pain, the heat suddenly stops and you feel your body rapidly cool off.

You pray the painful part it is over, but the tests appear to have just begun.  You are suddenly shocked with what feels like a battleship-level taser.  Every single muscle in your body from toe to eyebrow twitches and spasms uncontrollably.

“W-w-w-w-h-h-a-a-t are you d-oing to m--eeee?” you demand of Mr Deter.
He looks at you with a solemn expression as you howl and stutter in pain.  

“//Science,//” he replies in the same manner an inquisitor may have once said the word, “God.”

You try and move, to fall off the shocking disk, but the soles of your feet seem stuck to it as dreaful pain radiates out from below.
[[Owwwwww!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="304" name="Try and figure another way out" tags="" position="8490,8130" size="100,100">under construction (alt route)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="305" name="Owwwwww!" tags="" position="8634,8182" size="100,100">//This isn’t right!//

“Ahhhhhhhhhh!” you scream for ages as a variety of painful sensations torture you from head to toe.  After what feels like an eternity, the torture machine suddenly shuts off and you slump forward like a puppet who just had its strings cut.

You manage to crane your neck just enough to see Mr.Deter, syringe in hand, eagerly moving towards you.  You are completely helpless.

There is a dull prick of pain and then you cannot help but close your eyes as you are coaxed by some magical chemical into a blissful sleep.

After the experiments you wake up in a strange chamber like a glass tanning bed.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pod.png&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
//What the fuck!?// you think as you look around and pound your feeble fists against the glass that surrounds you.

You notice Mr.Deter standing nearby.
[[scream for help]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="306" name="scream for help" tags="" position="8782,8281" size="100,100">“Let me out!” you wail at him. Your high, ringing voice echoes around you, stinging your own ear drums.

Mr. D. hits an intercom button on the outside of the chamber.  “You consented to these tests, Taylor.  We are nearly finished, so don’t you worry your pretty little head!”

“Ahhhhhhhh!” you scream again in terror, hoping someone might hear you and if not save you at least call the police.

Mr.Deter gives you a pitious look.  He hits the intercom again, “you are just damaging your own ears.  Just be quiet and relax...and //be still!//”

“What!?” you screech in surprise as small panels open on the tank’s boundary and strange, coiling restraints emerge and bind you tightly, reminding you far too much of an old tentacle hentai video for you to to anything but scream in horror yet again.

“What are you doing to me, you fucking madman!?” you yell.

“Just a little brain surgery, my dear, nothing to be concerned about,” Mr. Deter assures you.  &quot;I am a very proficient with this particular gadget.  I have only maimed four out of seven of my last test subjects.”  Mr. gives a pleased sigh, like he has just inhaled the fragrance of fresh flowers.  “//Progress.//”

You struggle against the restraints but find them to be ironclad.  Even if you were a male bodybuilder you still doubt you would be capable of breaking free.  In your current state, it is of course very much impossible.

“I will fucking kill yo----------aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Your own echoing scream is the last thing you hear before you black out.

[[A light beckons]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="307" name="A light beckons" tags="" position="8631,8332" size="100,100">You wake up on an unfamiliar couch in Mr.Deter’s trailer.  You sit up, feeling groggy and quite ...//discombobulated//.  You remember Mr.D giving you some basic tests and then everything is a haze after that.  You have a mild headache.

“What happened?” you ask Mr. Deter.

“We finished the tests but you required more blood and you fainted during the draw.  No issues though, just get a few good hearty meals and include some extra iron in your diet.”

“Thanks I guess?  So what did you find out?”

“Have you ever heard of...//Thomas Crane Affair?//” he asks you with undue emphasis.

You blink, feeling a twinge within your brain, like trying to recall an elusive memory that slips away.  “No, I don’t think I have…&quot; you finally answer.  &quot;Is it important?”

“Oh, no, not now at least.”

You sigh and stumble towards the trailer&#39;s door.  Your feet seem unsteady and your balance a bit off...more than your new proportions would imply at least.  //I don&#39;t feel very good...//

“Taylor, what do you think about me?  Be honest.”

[[Be honest]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="308" name="Be honest" tags="" position="8777,8424" size="100,100">You decide to be excessively brief.  “I think you’re a fucking psycho,” you reply bluntly.

“And would you ever sleep with me?”

“Hahahaha!  Not in a fucking //million-billion-trillion years,// you fucker!”

Mr. D laughs at your honesty.  “I see.”

“I am out of here, Dr. Creepo,” you say as you turn to leave.
“Not so fast, Taylor.”

“Dude, I do not give a fuck if you are my teacher….”

“Hush, Taylor.”

“Don’t “hush” me!”

“Tell me, Taylor, have you ever heard of…. //Protocol One//?”

His question gives you an instant headache, a [[lightning storm migraine]].  

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="309" name="Get Mr.D’s info" tags="" position="8775,8550" size="100,100">You knew from the sheer randomness of your transformation that it was something significant.  You had also steeled yourself to the possibility it would take sacrifices along the way to unravel such a potentially vast conspiracy.  You needed information.  You needed help.  You needed Mr.Deter.  //God damnit!//

You stand before him, crossing your arms over your breasts.

“Strip?” Mr.Deter prompts.  You resist the urge to strike Mr. Deter right in his fat, smug face.  He sees your immediate anger and softens his approach.  &quot;Just take your shirt off, show me your breasts, and then lie down on the couch while I do my business.  A simple business transaction and sign of trust between allies,” he compromises.

You stare daggers at him but he impassively meets your gaze. Eventually you find yourself looking away and your hands seem to move robotically to undress yourself.

//This is soooo fucked up!  I am really stripping for my fucking teacher!  Why the fuck am I doing this!?  What has gotten into me!?//
You slide your shirt over your head while Mr.Deter ocularly ravishes you.  You feel your face burn up with embarrassment as you let your bra fall loose, baring your perfect, perky breasts for your professor to inspect in all their glory.

“Ah!” you call out as Joseph grabs your breasts and gives them a brief squeeze.  He leers at you and pushes you down onto the couch.

You only manage to squeal in protest when Mr. Deter slides off his pants, revealing a large, erect cock.  He then mounts your chest, pressing his fetid smelling dick into your face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/detercouch.jpg&quot; width=&quot;691px&quot; height=&quot;921px&quot;&gt;
 
You hate it.  It is gross.  It stinks.  Yet those facts don’t stop Deter from rubbing his leaking penis all over your lips and cheeks.  You refuse to open your mouth, but he doesn’t seem to mind, eagerly rubbing his stiff manhood against you.

He repositions and rubs his cock head back and forth across your lips, coating their center with a film of pre-cum.  His proximity gives you a disgustingly good view of Deter’s dick.  Its odd shaped bulbous pink head and veiny shaft along with the unwashed odor of stale sweat fill your senses.

[[Try and think about something else and detach from the moment]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="312" name="Try and think about something else and detach from the moment" tags="" position="8776,8699" size="100,100">After what seems like decades of your teacher rubbing his cock against your face, he finally skoots back slightly and begins to cup and fondle your breasts.  Deter gives each of your nipples a hard squeeze and a tug.  Dr.D then rubs his cock up and down the center of your chest, giving you a fucked up cock-sternum rub.  Deter moans with pleasure as he uses his hairy, strong hands to squish your breasts together onto his manhood.  Your breasts aren’t //quite// big enough to give an adequate titjob but Deter doesn’t seem to mind.  You just look down at the cock thrusting through your cupped breasts with a feeling of absolute shame and regret.  Was any information in the world worth //this// disgusting humiliation?  

Soon the moment you dread arrives.  With a groan, Mr.Deter ejaculates all over your heaving chest.  Soon your breasts are covered in his putrid smelling cock juice.  //Fuck my fucking life!  Fuck!  Mr. Fucking Deter just came all over my... my... fucking tits...Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!//  Everything about that statement is so //wrong// you feel your brain stall completely.

//Bastard!//  “What about our promise?” you shoot back.

“I still have results to analyze.  Come to my office tomorrow after class in the evening sometime.  I will have what you need then.  Thanks for that though, your tits look even more amazing when they are covered in my cum.”

“Fuck off you dick!” you yell as you step into Deter’s awkwardly small bathroom.  You turn on the faucet but no water comes out.  “What the heck?”

“Sorry, I am out water. I had one of the tanks replaced with nitrogen and it costs money to refill and I needed a new laser induction defibrillator…”

You look down at your cum covered breasts, splattered with an astonishing amount of your teacher’s semen.  You grab a wad of toilet paper and paw his cum off you before pulling your shirt back over your head.  As you go to leave, you remember your bra and dash back and grab it, giving Deter’s disappointed reaction a baleful glare in response.

You walk home with a heavy heart, ever conscious of the stink of Deter’s semen covering your chest.

You REALLY hope this all worth it.

[[Go back home and wash up]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="314" name="Go back home and wash up" tags="" position="8774,8848" size="100,100">By the time you are home you are dragging your feet.

“Ughh Ish neesh…” Your words come out slurred.  //What the fuck is wrong with my voice!?//

Your headache from earlier returns with a vengeance.

“W-w-w-wha--t’s happening to me?” you stammer.

You make it upstairs and into the shower.  You strip off your clothes with shaking limbs.

You manage to get inside the tub and pull the shower curtain shut.  With a trembling hand, you turn the water on full blast and it pelts you in the face.  After a few minutes, you feel a little bit better.  The headache remains but eventually becomes muted, like dull, annoyinging background noise.

You try and sleep but find your headache prevents you from falling asleep until three in the morning.

The next day after uneventful classes, you show up at Mr.D’s office.  You fight the queasy feeling in your stomach as you knock and then enter when he calls from inside.

“Great, Taylor!  You’re finally here,&quot; Mr. D greets you.  &quot;I have been waiting a long time and I don’t like to wait.  My time is far too valuable to squander.”

“Did you finally analyze everything?” you ask the professor.

“Yes, in great detail.”

“And?  What did you learn?”

“That you, Taylor Roux, are //exceptional.//”  

“From not impressive to exceptional in a day.  Wow.”

Mr.D snorts.  “It isn’t your intellect that is impressive!  It is your body and the marvel of science and evolution it represents.  Your current form is indeed based upon my research but I did not do this to you.  It would take me another five years to get to the point where I would even attempt such a thing.  I simply do not have the resources.  It was //them.//”

“Who the fuck is “//them//?” you wonder.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="315" name="Play footsie with Ryan" tags="" position="12609,15046" size="100,100">
Ryan is now is staring at you with his back to Julie as she turns back to the kitchen and waffle iron.  Suddenly you feel anxious and are unable to meet Ryan’s gaze.  His pestering also makes it impossible to enjoy your breakfast...well at least not in the traditional sense.

Ryan’s foot returns, poking at you with an enquiring sock-covered toe.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/footsy.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
With each second of contract it sends small pleasurable tingles surging throughout your body.  It is just a fucking toe...but no, it is so much more than that.  It’s //Ryan’s// toe. 

//Hmph!  Two can play at this game!// You think as you counter attack, using your cute little barefoot toes to brush oh-so-gently up Ryan’s pant leg while shooting him your steamiest, most sultry glance.

Ryan sits up in his chair and looks at you like it is taking every iota of his self control not to kick over the fucking table and take you right then and there.

As Ryan makes idle chit-chat with Julie he keeps petting your feet with his own until you are all hot and bothered.

[[After breakfast]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="316" name="After breakfast" tags="" position="12461,15092" size="100,100">
After breakfast Julie starts to get ready for work.

“Are you going to stick around, Ryan?” Julie asks her boyfriend.

Ryan looks at you and exhales loudly before answering.  “Well I work from home most of the time and technically I am my own boss,” he boasts.  “As long as I fulfill my directive no one really cares what I do,” he continues elaborating.  “I probably should get some work done today though.  And I do need to make a trip to the office eventually,” he adds.
Before Ryan can corner you alone, you decide to do the responsible thing and get the fuck away from him.  You head to the big room in the basement you and your sister jokingly call “the study” and try and cool off.  “The study,” despite its grand name,  was just a room of old boxes and assorted junk piled next to a couple partially filled bookshelves and an old desktop PC.

You flip on the PC and start to do some research.  You cannot allow yourself to get distract while so much is at stake.
[[Use the old PC to research some potential leads]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="317" name="Use the old PC to research some potential leads" tags="" position="12609,15202" size="100,100">“Hey cutie, how is it going?” Ryan asks as you he enters the study.  Ryan had crept down the stairs like a ghost and he nearly gives you a fucking heart attack with his sudden appearance and question.

“Good,” you finally manage to answer.

“Just good?” he wonders, sounding oh-so concerned.  //Just fucking leave me alone please!  Go be handsome somewhere else!//

“What does a beautiful young woman like you have to be worried about?”
You frown at him, or try to, the muscles in your mouth don’t quite work as intended.

“Okay,” you reply, concentration lost in the map in front of you.  “And can you //please// not call me that?” you request.

Ryan becomes mock outraged.  “Can’t call a cutie a cutie?  Damn shame, this world we live in.  Sorry, Taylor, I don’t even know I am capable of such a thing.  I am just honest to a fault.”   He steps forward and gets a look at what you appear to be researching.  

“Trans Corp?” Ryan reads with a raised eyebrow, as he inspects the map.
Ryan makes a funny face, almost like he knows something about the company that you may find interesting.  “You know of it?” you ask, trying not to give away your apparent interest.

“Of course, they are an old client,” Ryan answers.  “Big diversified holding company, but their primary business in the transport sector: rail, shipping, long haul trucks, that kind of thing.”

//Hmm.  Why would a transportation company transform me into a girl?//  The idea seemed pretty far-fetched.  //Maybe I didn’t even find the right company.//   Or maybe you were just really stupid for assuming that the prefix “Trans” was somehow suspicious.  You sigh.  //Fuckin’ dead end.//

“Why so curious?” Ryan enquiries.
[[Answer Ryan]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="318" name="Answer Ryan" tags="" position="12457,15232" size="100,100">“Oh I am…”  //I am really a man.  I am searching for a cure for a disease I think I got on the internet-- err…// “I am doing a research paper on them for my business class.  Learning about corporate structure and the like,” you grudgingly answer.

Ryan nods, clearly impressed.  “I didn’t know you were studying business too.  Got the impression you were more of a science geek.”
“I am.  I have a lot of interests though,” you respond nonchalantly.

“This Trans Company thingy though, to diversify they would buy businesses that are unrelated to their core, right?”

“Yeah, that is how diversification works…” Ryan dryly replies.  You feel momentarily stupid for asking, but Ryan doesn’t seem to mind.  He smiles at you warmly when you blush in embarrassment at your stupid question.

“Does Trans Corp own anything in sciences?  Maybe something in this general area?” you ask.  You wave an elegant, slender finger around a loop over the map around the vicinity of the campus.

“Um, well..I know they own a research facility up in Cassier but it is a long hike up into the mountains,” he cautions, sounding somewhat concerned over your safety.  //That’s a nice sentiment but I don’t need this suave asshole to protect me.//  “Hmmm…” Ryan suddenly eyes you up and down.  “Well we do have all day…” he muses.  He then places his huge hand atop yours, engulfing it completely.

“Um...W-well…” you stammer.

“Well I have been eager to spend some more time with you…” Ryan says to as he leans in and plants a kiss on your lips.

You give a surprised squeak but are soon overwhelmed by his lips and presence.
[[Give in...but just for a moment]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="319" name="Give in...but just for a moment" tags="" position="12605,15342" size="100,100">Ryan’s determined carrasses are too much for you to bear.  You let his arms sweep around you and pull you close to him.  You make out standing up until you are unable to manage even that.  //Why do my knees feel so damn weak?//

With a sigh, you fall down onto a nearby couch.

“How about I take you up to Cassier tomorrow?  Maybe we could make a “field trip” out of it,” Ryan offers.

“Hmm…”

“What?  Don’t you want to check out the facility?  Or maybe you’re a little nervous about spending the day alone with me?”

//Ugh...right on both counts...//

Suddenly you hear a chime sound effect and Ryan checks an alert on his phone.  “Yes!” he says excitedly, fist pumping the air like he just won the lottery.

“What happened?  Good news?” you venture.

You smirk at Drew. “Just like you,” you tease your portly friend.

Drew’s brow furrows. “It isn’t like you are getting laid either. Besides, you know that isn’t what I meant…” Drew sighs.

&quot;Geez. It was just a joke.&quot;

“I don’t think the boy tanks are having sex with other boy tanks...because there aren’t any! There is just no such thing,” Drew concludes.

“Well what about if it was a fucking //pink// tank and it had two big rainbow flags streaming from the turret?  Oh and what if it shot dildos straight into the asses of male criminals?  Huh?  What then, would //that not// be a gay tank?”

“Taylor, can you please shut up while I mop up the rest of your forces?” Drew requests.

You watch with disappointment as all your little soldiers are slaughtered by Drew’s superior strategy.

“That is that!” Drew says as the match ends in your defeat.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bar.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Once inside you see Evan sitting with Jimmy and Rhea.  Jimmy is waving his arms around as he tells some animated story to Rhea.  You see they all have drinks, Rhea and Jimmy appear to have extras.  You decide to get one yourself, ordering your favourite beer on tap.

You wander back to the tables and eventually Evan notices you and comes to speak to you.

“Cool, you came out!” Evan says, sounding surprised.

“I //really// needed a drink!” you shoot back, as you take a big sip from your beer.  The fruity, faint orange peel beer is to die for.  You and Evan bullshit for a few minutes and then grab another round and return to the tables.

The music is absurdly loud so no one really tries to talk to you, something you appreciate on this strange night.  You find the atmosphere cathartic and find yourself having a pretty good time.  While sipping your third drink, you suddenly realize you are more than tipsy and it is getting a bit late.  //But I barely even drank anything!//  As a man you could drink like a fish when the opportunity arose but it seems your much smaller female body did not have quite the same level of stamina and tolerance.

Maybe I should...

//This is just a nightmare,// you tell yourself.  //It will be over soon.  I will wake up and everything will be fine.  I am a happy young man in the real world…//

You are surprised and grateful when Mitch stops groping you.  You feel yourself becoming tired and drifting off to sleep, despite your awkward position.  When you open your eyes again, you find that Mitch has already unbuckled his pants and unzipped his fly.

The sheer fucked-up-ness of the situation causes you to sober up, the opposite of what you now want.  You wish you could escape or even black out but there was simply nowhere to go.  The idea of losing your virginity to //MITCH// in a dirty bathroom is hell in your mind.  But the thoughts become slippery, elusive, and drift away, replaced by a dull tingle and feel of dizziness and vertigo.

“Taylor, you stupid bitch.  //You// did this to me,” Mitch says.  His giant, blood engorged cock is now pointing directly at your face.  It is leaking precum and dripping onto the bathroom tile.  “This is all your fault!  Take responsibility you good-for-nothing slut!” Mitch yells at you as he wipes his precum on your cheek and slides his manhood between and then over top of your lips.

The next few minutes are an incoherent daze as you fade in and out of consciousness.

You are dimly aware of being poked and prodded.  You try and fight back but in your state you are unable to defend yourself.  There are more flashes of light as Mitch snaps several more pictures on his phone before he leaves you alone, his semen still dripping off of you.

“Uhh… maybe, but It is still //so// fucking weird!”

“Yeah, sure it is weird, but sometimes that taboo feeling makes for some pretty satisfying fantasies.”

“Are you being serious right now?  I can’t tell.”

Evan dodges your question.  “Do you want to hang out?” he asks you.

“We already are…”

“No, I mean tonight.  We could watch a movie on my big screen,” he suggests.  “I know how you love those lame sci-fi movies.”

“They aren’t lame!”

It is already a bit late but you have always been a glutton for leisure.  You usually have fun with Evan too, except this time you can’t help but feel your friend might have an ulterior motive.

We aren’t exactly known for our impulse control,” she jokes while running her hands all over your body.  You can suddenly smell the faint odor of alcohol on your sister&#39;s breath.  //Uh oh...//

//This has gone on long enough!!// You begin to come clean.  “But Julie I am your--”

“Tammy don’t worry, Taylor won’t give a fuck, or find out.  //Trust me//.”

“I--uh….”  As your brain furiously churns in an attempt to crank out a response, Julie resumes molesting you.  The next thing you know, you are looking up your sister’s familiar face, stark and beautiful.  You become certain that Julie is about to kiss you.

Your breasts shift position on your chest and your long brown hair falls across your face.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

//My breasts and my long hair?  I don&#39;t have either of those things...// you think, your mind suddenly feeling foggy.

&quot;Wait... Where the fuck am I?&quot; you wonder.

You look around and see banks of computers and screens.  You raise a slender arm that doesn&#39;t quite feel like your own and it pulls a tube along with it.  You have an IV connected to some gross yellow looking liquid.  You stare at the modern medical technology that surrounds you.  You appear to be in a hospital of some kind, but it certainly doesn&#39;t look like the campus medi-centre.  You also seem to be sealed inside some kind of glass room, like you have seen in zombie outbreak movies.  // That is not a good sign….//

More concerning to you than your sickness, is now the apparent fact you appear to be locked up.  You squint out past the double walled glass.  You can just faintly make out a sign reading, &quot;Isolation Ward One&quot; on the other side of an empty nurse station.

&quot;Fuck me!&quot; you shout in disbelief.

You then look down and your disbelief compounds itself a hundredfold.  &quot;What the FUCK!?&quot; you howl as you look down at your clearly defined breasts tenting your hospital gown.

&quot;Why do I have //boobs!?//&quot;

//If I have boobs...//  Your hand shoots to your crotch.

&quot;//HE// woke up from the coma,&quot; another doctor corrects the first two.

&quot;It appears to be a spontaneous sexual reassignment - without surgery or chemicals involved.  I have never heard of anything of its like,&quot; observes a fifth doctor.

&quot;What about the latest tests?&quot;

&quot;All clean.  I have no explanation nor a hypothesis for how this could have transpired.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; you shout at them.  &quot;What the fuck!?  Let me out of here now!&quot;

The lead doctor, a man with iron-grey hair and tiny spectacles, steps forward.  &quot;I am sorry… Mr. Roux….but we cannot do that until we determine if your //condition// is contagious.&quot;

&quot;What the hell happened to me!?&quot; you screech at the doctors.

 &quot;I am sorry, Mr. Roux….we do not have an explanation for you.  But do not despair, for we have called in the brightest minds in the public //and// the private sector.  I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this.&quot;
 
&quot;I feel fine!  Let me out right now, you fuckers!!  I don&#39;t consent to any of this bullshit!&quot; you yell at them.

The lead doctor frowns in irritation.  &quot;I am sorry, Mr. Roux, but the //Patriot Renewal Act #17//  has given us full authority to do as we please until we determine if you are a threat to the nation.&quot;

&quot;What the hell?  I am //harmless!//&quot;

&quot;We have yet to make that official determination.  At any rate, the technology, or virus,...or whatever abnormality you represent is a huge issue for national security.  If you can transform your sex and appearance in such a manner, what&#39;s next?  Could you turn into the president and take over the country?  Hmm?  Could you impersonate and blackmail a politician? Hmm? Such powers must only be invested in secretive government branches because they are trustworthy stewards that only use such things for the forces of good.&quot;

//Did that guy just say all that with a straight face?  Holy fuck!//

&quot;I am afraid the government will need you to comply with all of your demands,&quot; the doctor finishes, not sounding at all upset over making such an absurd request.

&quot;No way!&quot;

&quot;Your country needs you and very much appreciates your sacrifice,&quot; the doctor adds.

&quot;You mother fuckers!  Let me out!  Let me out!  Let me fucking oooooooouuuuuuuuut!!!&quot; you howl at them until you hear the whirr of a nearby machine and your world suddenly fades to black.

You see a slender young man dressed as a doctor.  As you look at his narrow face you suddenly recognise him.

&quot;Damien?&quot;

&quot;Taylor!  Holy crap it is you!  Dude, what the fuck?  You made the news!&quot;

You recall meeting Damien during your final year of high school.  You are pretty sure he wasn&#39;t sober for a single day that entire year and you joined him for more than a few of his benders.  How he managed to get good grades and somehow get into med school is beyond you.

You groan.  //Trapped in a cage and still making a spectacle of myself on the world stage.  This is totally NOT what I wanted to become famous for.//

&quot;What happened to me?&quot; you ask your old friend.  You are ecstatic to finally see a familiar and potentially friendly face.  //Maybe Damien will help me get the hell out of here...//

&quot;Nobody knows,&quot; Damien whispers in answer.  He looks around out of evident paranoia.  &quot;The whole hospital- the whole damn scientific community is up in arms.  Your transformation has started some big debate- the university has about thirty bigwigs meeting right now to determine if this a hoax or a scientific quantum leap.  Either way...you are now a part of medical history,&quot; he informs you.  He appears quite //jealous,// you are sure Damien expected to make medical history well before you...who never once even considered the medical field.

&quot;I am sorry, Taylor.  I have to go… I will come back when I can.&quot;

&quot;Please, Damien!  Don&#39;t leave me.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; he assures you as you drift off again.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sam.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hey Sam,” you greet your friend.

Samantha blinks at you. “Do I know you?” she asks you.  Sam looks quite puzzled.  Her bright blue eyes draw you in further.

[[Re-introduce yourself to Sam]]

“Huh? I don&#39;t understand. Taylor is a boy.  You’re a girl,” she observes, seemingly mystified by your confession.

“I am aware.  //Something// happened to me,” you lamely explain.

Sam raises an eyebrow. “Ok-aaay…Is this one of those prank shows?”

You take out your student ID and wallet and hand it to her.  “Wow you have Taylor’s wallet too...I doubt you would steal it and then give it me….  Are you really Taylor Roux?” Sam asks you.

“In the fucking flesh…”  //Just some that doesn’t feel like my own...//
Sam makes a weird face.  Her eyes narrow suspiciously and she looks around as if hoping to spot some hidden cameras.  “A few years back Taylor and some of us went out to the big lake at Elmhead and we all got really drunk... What did we have for breakfast that summer when “you” and a bunch of people stayed over?”

“Hamburgers and cinnamon buns,” you answer without missing a beat.  “The breakfast of champions!”

Sam’s eyes nearly pop out of their sockets with surprise.  “Wow!  I actually believe you!  This is amazing...and scary...and like crazy!  Imagine the implications of such technology!  How did this happen? I just saw you the other day!”  Sam’s blue eyes narrow and then go wide again. “Shouldn’t you be in like a hospital or something?  What if you’re sick?”

“I have asked myself that a few times…” you admit.  “The thing is: I don’t know what happened to me, but clearly there is //weird shit// happening at this university.  I don’t want to draw any unwanted attention to myself until I get a more clear understanding of what the hell is going on around here.”

“Wow, Taylor.  That is a lot to take in!  You make my problems seem small by comparison.  You must be super stressed out.  Being a girl is probably not at all like you expected.”

“Believe me, I didn’t have many expectations…”

“Well if you need help I am here for you.  And if you want to relax you could come out with us tonight.  Jimmy, Evan, and Rhea...maybe a few others are having a little get together.”

Sam frowns.  She suddenly looks like a sad little girl.  “I got into some trouble,” she explains.  “I can be a little bit of a ditz sometimes,” Sam admits, “and so this morning I was in a big rush and I forgot to lock my door at the dorm when I left.  When I came back someone had gone through all my stuff…”

“Whhhaat? Lame!  That sucks!  Did they take anything?”

Sam suddenly sniffs and you can see the tears well in her eyes.  Seeing such a sweet, beautiful, young woman in tears, makes your heart break.  //They must have taken something valuable.//

“The only thing that matters is they took my mom’s necklace.  She gave it to me a week before she died of cancer last year.”

//Yiewwwww….//  You feel an aura of awkwardness and depression descend around you.

“Maybe it will turn up.  I will add it to my list of quests too,” you say with a smile you hope comes off as comforting.

“Thanks, Taylor.  You’re really sweet to be concerned about me even though you have like “comic book” level drama going on in your own life.”  Sam even manages a weak laugh and you feel like you have made progress towards cheering her up.

“Hey, it’s nothing,&quot; Sam answers, in an obvious effort to downplay her emotions.  &quot;Don’t worry about it Taylor...My necklace isn&#39;t that important...&quot; she says with a sniff, making you sure she isn&#39;t being truthful. &quot;All the more reason we should go to this party tonight and distract ourselves!” Sam suggests on an upbeat note. 

It would be rude to refuse now...besides this is one of the longest conversations you have ever had with Sam without stuttering like an ignoramus.  “I will meet you at Jimmy’s at seven then,” you inform Sam.

You knock and Evan let’s you inside. 

“Taylor!” Sam calls your name as she runs up to you, throwing her arms around you.  She nearly knocks you over.  As you look at Sam’s flushed face, you get the impression she may have started the festivities a bit early.  You grab yourself a drink and play a game of darts with Jimmy.

“So what shall we do for the next round of entertainment?” Jimmy enquires after another round of drinks and idle joking.

“Truth or dare,” suggests Evan.

“//Strip// poker,” offers Rhea.

“How about…. //spin the bottle?//” Sam suggests.

Rhea cackles at Samantha, “What are you, ten?”

“No, I am just…I thought it would be...” Sam stumbles over her words.  //Is...she looking at me?//

“Eh?  Could be fun,” Evan interrupts.  “As long as I don’t have to kiss fucking Jimmy.  With three babes I like my odds.”

“Well Taylor, what do //you// think we should play?” Rhea presses you.

“Let’s get this party started!” Rhea shouts as she begins the game.  With a flick of her wrist, Rhea spins the bottle until it is a blur.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spin.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
It stops pointing slightly away from, but closest to, you. 

//Already!//  You can’t help but suck in a nervous breath.

As Rhea locks eyes with you there is a moment where she seems to captivate and dominate in you in an instant- the power of a total 10/10 babe staring you down with the sultritest “come hither” look imaginable.

You freeze up as Rhea sensually crawls towards you like an erotic slinky.  You break out into a cold sweat.  Her smokey gaze has left you captivated, like stunned prey to be devoured by a lioness.  You don’t want to be so helpless, but you end up not moving a muscle as Rhea descends upon you and lays her beautiful, full, sensual lips down upon yours without any further ceremony.

You feel your whole world go dark except for the woman in front of you.
//Holy fuck Rhea is a good kisser….ahhh why the fuck am I surprised?//
“Ohh…” you moan in disappointment as Rhea finishes off the most intense kiss of your life.  A part of you wishes you would have had the experience a few weeks earlier.  //But that wasn’t so bad...//  

You shake your head to banish the conflicting thoughts in your mind.  With a shaking hand, you spin the bottle … and it lands dead on Rhea.

Evan and Jimmy curse in disappointment but quickly change their tune.  A part of you is very happy, although you still would have preferred to kiss Sam instead of Rhea.

As Jimmy begins to deal out cards, you are suddenly struck with an odd notion.  //Fuck this might be a lose-lose.  I don’t want to strip!  And I sure as fuck don’t want to see Jimmy and Evan naked, eww….//  You figure the chance of you, Evan, and Jimmy being fully clothed while Rhea and Sam are reduced to nakedness is...very low.  //Fuck...//

“So how does this even work?” you ask. 

“Let’s make this interesting!  How about each “chip” represents a piece of clothing,” Evan explains.

You swallow hard as you mentally count your articles of clothing.  //I got socks...underwear...//  You suddenly regret not wearing a watch.  You will be out in a eight rounds or so, depending if the jury of peers let’s you cheap out with items like your belt and necklace.

You suddenly freeze up.  “As long as I don’t get pregnant!”  //Holy fucking shit!//  That idea had never seriously occured to you.  Are are you even capable of having a child?  You’ve been so preoccupied with everything going on around you that you had not really considered the implications of having unprotected sex.  You will have to be very careful going forward.  //The last thing I want is a fucking love-child….with fucking Evan...my god...//  You imagine showing up to talk to your parents, not only suddenly and inexplicably morphed into woman, but also carrying a child… the child of your best friend...a male...  
“Wow.  Just fucking wow.  No,  nooooooo!”  You mentally barricade the thoughts away.

You do a few chores, not quite managing to dispel your previous thoughts.  Still, it has been nearly a month and you haven’t had a period. 

“I //definitely// would have noticed that,” you mutter as you root around Evan’s room, in a search for your missing clothes.  “Hmm…”  Another weird thought suddenly occurs to you.  Considering you used to be a man, you might very well be //sterile//.  

“That might actually be pretty great!” you say optimistically, trying to desperately to hide in any silver lining that presents itself.  “No belly aches and sex as nature intended.” 

Wouldn’t that be pretty great if you got the upsides without the trade-offs?

Well it isn’t that you exactly //like// being a girl, but it was hard to ignore the obvious benefits.  You’ve always been plain but now people stare at you wherever you go.  The orgasms were just //so// much better.

//Wait, or is there?//  “I need to get tests done!”  //Of, course why didn’t I think of this sooner!?  I just need some professional analyses on some hair and blood samples and I might be able to figure out something actually useful!//

You meet up with Evan outside the chemistry building, a hulking concrete structure built next to the biology labs.

You figure you should be able to get a few discreet tests here.  The place is full of equipment and materials along with eager premed students to do the tests.

Evan seems impressed.  “We should have thought of this sooner.”

“We are pretty dumb,” you admit.

“Hey--yeah, whatever.  We could have asked my dad too.  We still can if you want.  My dad&#39;s clinic is pretty discreet.”

“Yeah I thought of that, but how weird would that be?  What if he wants to examine me?”

“Oh yeah…  My dad is a professional but you definitely shouldn’t show him your pussy.  He cheats on my mom all the time.”

“Good to know…”

“So how are we paying for this?”

“For what?”

“For the bribes to get in, for the tests, the labour...”

“I have to pay?  It is university!  They already took nine thousand dollars from me this semester and I cannot get a complimentary blood test!?”

“Whoa, calm down, Taylor.”

“I am calm!!” you shout back.

“If we go to my dad’s practice it is free.”

“We already came all this way…”

“It isn’t far.  Your call.”

You decide to:

About fifteen minutes later, you and Evan enter his family’s practice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/clinicout.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
It is a small clinic with probably four or five doctors present with a small lab and attached pharmacy.  You wait patiently in the lobby while Evan chats with the woman at reception and then goes off into the back, presumably to speak with his father.

Let’s //fuck,//” he says casually.

“It has been a day and you already want to do it again?”

“Of course!”

“We were pretty...//overzealous//...last night, Evan….”

“Oh...sorry.  Once I got started I just couldn’t hold back.”

“It is okay, it is my fault too.”

You suddenly choose to kneel between Evan’s legs.

Evan looks surprised.  

“What?  We already agreed to help each other out.  Look at this fucking boner, you are clearly in distress,” you observe as you take off your top.

You rub your hand on Evan’s bulging crotch.  You soon free Evan’s cock and give it a few free, soft jerks.  You suddenly have an urge to take his head in your mouth.  //Fuck how many times have I done this now?  Probably not a good sign I am losing track...// you think as your head begins to bob up and down on Evan’s shaft.  You lick, caress, and suck Evan until he is nearly at his limit.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/cummiddlefinger.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ohhh Taylor!  Fuck yesssssss……..aaaaaaaah!!!”  Evan withdraws from your mouth and starts to frantically jerk off until he starts to shoot his load all over your face and chest.  Somewhat pleased at your quick work, you close your eyes and accept Evan’s seed with a smile.  He keeps ejaculating on you for so long that you keep opening your eyes, sure he is finished, only to nearly be hit in the eye by Evan’s flying semen and continuing load.  //Wow...That’s almost impressive...// you admit as you realize how many spurts of cum have covered your body.  When Evan is finished, he can’t help but jerk off the last remnants onto your chest and you can’t help but give your friend a playful middle finger.  “You fucking asshole, look at me!”

“Mhmmmmmmm……” Evan says as he loses himself in your creamy, half-naked body.
[[Meet Evan on campus]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="343" name="Meet Evan on campus" tags="" position="2496,14198" size="100,100">
The next day you go to school and meet Evan outside of class.  You note with a bit of concern that Drew is still MIA, which is super weird, he is not the type to miss class….//ever//.

“Hey Taylor!” Evan greets you.

“Hi.”

“Guess what, Taylor!? It is nearly time!” Evan shouts the cryptic words gleefully.  He makes an exaggerated grin and starts making weird head movements that make him look sort of like a duck.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” you ask your friend.

“I don’t blame you for being distracted and forgetting,” he says with a laugh.  “You know the long weekend is coming up…”  Evan leaves the statement hanging in the air, leaving you to connect the dots.

“Oh,// the cabin!//” you exclaim.  For the past four years your trio of friends had spent the long weekend out at Evan’s cabin.  The cabin belonged to Evan’s family and was a beautiful cozy structure isolated far from the city.

“Yep!” Evan gushes.  “Going to be so much fun!” he adds gleefully.  Pleasant memories flood your mind.  Spending time out there was always carefree and relaxing, and was usually one of the highlights of your year.

You stretch out your long, slender arms with a yawn.  “Good, I //really// need a vacation!”

“We are down a member,” you note as you pull out your phone.  Without the three of you it just wouldn’t be quite the same.

[[You call Drew.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="344" name="“W-What?” you balk." tags="" position="12461,15388" size="100,100">You can feel yourself becoming caught in Ryan’s magnetic pull, powerless to resist his gravity.  Ryan smiles at you again and you feel yourself move a step towards coronary arrest.  He is like the sun, too bright, too fucking hot, pulling everything that gets caught in its pull to be burned away in glorious cosmic fire.  At this point, it is hard to do anything except lose yourself in that brightness.  You don’t even care anymore that you are like a moth drawn to a flame.  There were just some things that were worth be burned up over.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You let Ryan kiss you.  You kiss him back.  Your tongues duel against each other.  The world slowly fades away.  All the nagging worries tugging at your soul disappear. 

Ryan suddenly pulls away much to your disappointment.

“Hold that thought,” he says.  Ryan dashes upstairs and into the kitchen.
You find yourself taking several much needed deep breaths.


[[Get out of the “stuffy” basement.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="345" name="Get out of the “stuffy” basement." tags="" position="12601,15494" size="100,100">You follow Ryan up the to the main level and then head upstairs to your bedroom.

You hear Ryan run back up the stairs.  A moment later he appears in the doorway.  He now stands shirtless and grinning before you. 
You notice Ryan now has a small bottle in his hand and an off-putting glint in his eye.

“What have you got there?” you ask him.

Ryan grins.  “Massage oil.  Tonight I am giving you the experience of a lifetime.  Prepare to experience the //best massage of your life.  I guarantee it!//”  

//Huh?  Fuck...what can I say to that?//  You are well past the point of no return.  You’ve fallen and reached terminal velocity.

It would be impossible to turn down the best massage of your life offered free of charge.  That Ryan is the one to administer it...that only makes it better in your mind.  There was nothing to feel guilty about just receiving a simple massage.  Sure Ryan is your sister’s boyfriend but it isn&#39;t like you are going to have sex with him.  //A massage is innocent, right?// you ask yourself.

While you are rationalizing, Ryan grabs a towel from the hall closet and lays it down on your bed.  He then eagerly motions for you to lie down and you find yourself obeying.

“Probably best to strip to your underwear, so you don’t get oil on your clothes,” Ryan advises.

You freeze.  //Fuck...he wants me to take my clothes off for him...and fuck me...I kinda want to!//

“Hmm… It would be a shame to get them all oily…”
[[Strip down]]
[[Preserve your modesty]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="346" name="Strip down" tags="" position="12461,15634" size="100,100">With a sigh you take your shirt off.  //It isn’t like Ryan hasn’t seen similar stuff before...He has seen Julie naked.  Underwear is like a swimsuit, and going swimming is nothing to be ashamed of!//  You hope you aren’t doing mental gymnastics to justify all of this.  But you are past resisting, the urges inside you are too great to deny.  You want your stress relieved.  You want Ryan’s hands on your body.  You want him desperately to give you a //massage//.

You slide your pants off and stand before Ryan clad only in your underwear.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayundies.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Wow.  You have a gorgeous figure.  You’re //so //beautiful, Taylor.”

Ryan grins at you as his expert hands immediately begin their assault, rubbing and massaging their way down your body.

“Oh!  Ah...you’re pretty good at this aren’t you?”  You cringe when you consider how many woman Ryan has practiced on over the years…  //Am I just one of the many?//  It was hard to believe, for Ryan made you feel like the most important person in the world.

“Heh, I am just getting started!”

Ryan starts at your extremities, with a soft caress of your soft hair that doesn’t end until Ryan is kneading your toes and the soles of your feet with a skill and dexterity that immediately has you squirming in delight.  Ryan’s hands press into your sensitive flesh.  He works with fingertips into your muscles with a gentle but stubborn firmness that leaves you powerless to resist as his hands explore and stimulate your entire body.  His unyielding fingers destroy any knot they come across.
Ryan continues to work towards your midsection from both ends.  He pressed firmly into the muscles below your collarbone and you feel an immense relief as the extra strain and accumulated tension caused by your breasts dissipates.

“Oh wow...” you say aloud, gradually allowing yourself to more vocally express your pleasure.  It is impossible for you to remain mute.  Soon Ryan is coaxing “ooos” and “Ahhs” from you.

Ryan massages your calves and outer thighs.   You feel yourself becoming uncontrollably aroused.  It seems the more indirectly Ryan touches you the more you feel yourself craving further contact.
//F---fuck!  He is driving me crazy...//

“You’re so tense, Taylor….but don’t worry, these hands are the perfect stress antidote.”

“You should be a masseuse.”
[[Continue getting pampered by Ryan.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="349" name="Continue getting pampered by Ryan." tags="" position="12461,15794" size="100,100">Just when you are sure Ryan is about to touch your tingling breasts and pussy, he does the last thing you expect: with a muscled arm, he flips you on your back and proceeds to massage your aching back and shoulder muscles.  Ryan works every, knot, kink, and worry from you.  Soon you are relaxed and comfortably warm from neck to heel.  

“Yikes!” you yelp when Ryan suddenly presses his thumbs deep into your ass cheeks to the point that it actually hurts.  You are about to yell at Ryan when he releases you and you feel a wave of relaxation emanate from your glutes.  //Wow...//  You doubt there has ever been a point in your life you have felt like you do now.  Ryan continues his work unceasingly.  He massages you for ages, until you almost feel yourself drifting off to sleep.  Ryan then gently rolls you over again and you smile up at him in a state of tranquil relaxation.

That contentment is soon shattered as Ryan&#39;s hand slowly trails to your most sensitive spots.

Suddenly you&#39;re //wide awake.//

[[As Ryan works your body, you become almost literal putty in his hands.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="350" name="As Ryan works your body, you become almost literal putty in his hands." tags="" position="12607,15888" size="100,100">Ryan’s expert caresses soon coax a shivering orgasm from you.  //His hands are magical,// you can’t help but think as you watch your legs spasm uncontrollably as a wave of pleasurable warmth covers you like a silk blanket.  Ryan keeps massaging you, pampering you with his tender touch.  Ryan begins to work his practiced fingers deeper into your erogenous territory.  Ryan teases you, his fingers foraying into unfamiliar ground.  He gently kneads the area around your breasts until the muscles are relaxed and your chest is free of tension.

“This is getting in the way of our massage,” Ryan observes.  Staring at you for confirmation, he gradually begins to pull your bra free.  Soon your beautiful B-cup breasts are bare for Ryan to feast upon.

He renews his erotic assault with lecherous impetus.  He draws circles around your breasts until they are aching to be to touched, your areola and nipples become rock hard.  By the time Ryan finally reaches your inner thighs, you are nearly delirious.  After Ryan has re-worked every inch of your body except your genitals, you have already given in completely to the throes of passion.  When Ryan eventually places his hand between your legs and rests his probing fingers upon your soaked, heat-emanating mound, Ryan just laughs at your distress.  //Ryan definitely wasn’t lying...//  You feel like you are on fire --so relaxed yet so fucking tense and sexually frustrated at the same time. The paradox makes you even more aroused.  

[[You zone out for a moment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="351" name="You zone out for a moment." tags="" position="12468,15940" size="100,100">You float on your blissful cloud.  You are barely aware of Ryan stripping down further; the next thing you know, Ryan’s bare skin is pressed against your own.

You look at Ryan and he smiles back at you, leaning in to plant a reassuring kiss upon your lips.  When he draws away, his hands gently slide your panties off you.  You are now naked before your sister’s boyfriend...who is also naked.  //There is no denying how fucked up this is!// your mind shrieks.  //But yet why the fuck do I want Ryan to keep going….there is still one place he is yet to massage...//

Ryan seems to note your ragged breath, your heat, your wetness, your glazed eyes and look of longing...he then makes a decision and finally touches your yearning pussy directly.

[[“Ohhhhhhhh!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="352" name="“Ohhhhhhhh!”" tags="" position="12608,16042" size="100,100">After everything he has done, like the ultimate culmination of foreplay, you are already at peak arousal.  With a a few delicate pets and the slight insertion of a jiggling middle finger, Ryan pushes you over the edge.  You cum, //hard.//  You flop around in Ryan’s muscled arms, riding his fingers to infinity and beyond.  After you are finished, Ryan attacks from another angle, entering you with two fingers while placing his hot, slick palm over your clit.  Whether your pleasure is caused by the angle of his fingers or the extra clitoral stimulation you don’t know, but you are soon launched into another dizzying orgasm within minutes of the first.  Ryan just cycles you like that, forcing you to cum, giving you a slight break, and then penetrating-stroking-and-vibrating you to climax with his magical hands.  You are now beyond any hope of resistance.  //This is bad...//  You can connect the mental dots.  If this goes on like this...Ryan - your sister’s fucking boyfriend will //fuck// you - a fucking man- and the most fucked part of all, is that at this very moment you know you would totally just let him have his way with you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/handsonpleasure2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You see Ryan’s rock hard cock pressing against your hip.  //Fuck….No….//  A part of you wonders what it might be like to have such a thing inside---//FUCK NO!  I don’t even know what the hell is going on anymore!  I can’t think about shit like that!//

[[You just want to feel good.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="353" name="You just want to feel good." tags="" position="12459,16092" size="100,100">You want to do what feels right.  And what feels right in this particular moment...is to enjoy the sensations coursing through your veins.  You want keep watching the fireworks going off in your brain...and to set off even more if possible.

You look at the clock in your room.  It is already so late.  Your sister could be back any moment...you will have to hurry or risk her arriving into an incredibly awkward scene.  You grab Ryan’s cock in your slender little hand and begin to pump your fist up and down his cock until he is rock hard and trembling.

//Fuck...I am holding Ryan’s cock again!  Why does this keep happening!?//

Your pale, slender fingers glids up and down his shaft unbidden.  Ryan’s hardness, his ragged breath, and his pulsing member clue you in to what is likely to happen next.  //Uh oh...//

“Ohhhh Taylor!” Ryan moans as he repositions himself.  He pulls you downward until your face is directly in front of his huge penis.  With a moan of ecstasy, Ryan then takes control over his own pleasure, jerking off all over your face.  After the legendary night he just shared with you, you accept his load with what you hope comes off as a playful smile.

With a moan, Ryan cums all over your face, covering you with smelly, thick cream.  Ryan spurts so many times you instinctively close your eyes and feel the sensation of several more blasts pelt your face and then drip down your lips.  Soon you have to breathe through cum.  //Oh my god,// you think, //what a mess….//  

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/facecreamsmilr.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Instead of being disgusted you are turned on immensely knowing that he came //that// much in your honor.  You can’t help but feel a bit sexy as you grin up at your partner.

A few moments later Ryan appears more clear headed.  “I should head out to the office before your cousin gets back.  Maybe you want a shower?  Pretty hot look for you though,” he adds with a chuckle.  “I will see you tomorrow for our little excursion, Taylor,” Ryan says, kissing you on the top of your head.

Ryan leaves you lying next to your bed, his huge load dripping down your face.

[[Go get cleaned up in the washroom]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="354" name="Go get cleaned up in the washroom" tags="" position="12608,16184" size="100,100">You suddenly feel embarrassed.  //Am I a ...slut?  Wow...//  You have always disapproved of your sister&#39;s promiscuity.  Yet now, you are demonstrating an even lesser level of self control.

You shower for a long time.  The warm water is the perfect end to your massage.  You feel so damn good but also morally conflicted.  Ryan’s semen gets stuck in patches in your hair and is difficult to wash out.  You feel sexy, hot, and satisfied, counterbalanced by feelings of regret and shame.  //I definitely crossed the line there with Ryan...//  Yet the taboo only seemed to increase the hotness of the whole scenario.  //Fucking hell!  What is wrong with me?//

After you are clean, you head back your room.  You cleverly hide the towel and bottle of massage oil under some dirty laundry.  “I really hope this “field trip” doesn’t get out of hand…” you murmur with a yawn.  You say the words only half wanting them to be true.  When you lie down in bed you immediately fall asleep upon closing your eyes.

[[Blissful sleep]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="355" name="Blissful sleep" tags="" position="12456,16234" size="100,100">The next morning you wake up wondering if the last two weeks have been a dream.  You pick up your phone and see Ryan has messaged you.

Ryan wonders what time you are free.

You reply you will be ready at noon.  You have afternoon classes but they are nothing you feel you can’t miss...especially if it means unravelling part of the mystery surrounding your circumstances.  That you gett to spend some time with Ryan in the process just a nice bonus.

You have a quick shower and eat a piece of peanut butter and honey toast before heading off to school.  

You find that class passes by at a turtle’s pace.  You frequently find yourself glancing at the clock until finally your last class of the morning finishes.  You race home with a level of giddiness that alarms and excites you further.

Twenty minutes later, Ryan [[arrives in a flashy red sports car.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="356" name="Stagger home" tags="" position="13163,16239" size="100,100">You are unable to sit down for the next week after your visit at Mitch&#39;s.

You find the pain in your behind to alternate between horrendous and barely tolerable.  Using the washroom is a bloody nightmare.  You try and laze around but find it surprisingly difficult to slack off while being deprived of your ability to sit.  The idea of going to class while drawing attention to yourself makes you decide to avoid going.  You play games while lying on your stomach until your boobs are squished and sore.

&quot;Fuck...I can&#39;t even nerd out…&quot;

It isn&#39;t long before you head to the medicine cabinet in search of a cure.  Hoping for some cream or an ointment, instead you find codeine and some heavy duty pain meds.  Eventually you do find a small tub of ointment near the back of the cabinet.

&quot;Hmm… this looks pretty strong,&quot; you mutter while holding up one of the pill bottles.  //Fucking just what I need to take the edge off...//  Still, you have been doing more drugs than usual lately and maybe it is time for a break or some moderation.

You decide to:

Not just your swollen asshole, but your entire body seems riddled with aches and pains.  //And that doesn&#39;t count how fucked up I am upstairs...//  You doubt even a lifetime of intense therapy will be able to wipe out the memories...and feelings you have experienced with Mitch.

You apply some cream to your ass and pop a few of the pills, eager to dull your misery.

You soon feel better and zone out for a week playing games and surfing the web.  You find yourself having no desire to go out, so you just stay in.  

Eventually the codeine runs dry and the pink pills start to call for you again, and for about full week you feel great...as long as you have the blessed //pink// coursing through you.  You find that time without it is dull and unsatisfying, like the world is rendered in black and white.  The headaches and sober blandness coax you to rejuvenate yourself, and you do, often.

You know you have a problem so you try and [[kick yourself out of your funk.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="359" name="Knock on the door" tags="" position="13044,17836" size="100,100">You knock and a grinning Mitch opens up a second later and lets you in.

&quot;Hey Taylor!  Long time no see!  Here for a booty call or some &quot;stuff&quot;?  Or maybe //both//?&quot; he leers at you.

&quot;...Just the &quot;stuff&quot;.&quot;

Mitch smirks at you.  &quot;How about we start with a bowl.  I got //crazy// shit right now.&quot;

You want to get high so fucking bad but know if you do so Mitch will take advantage of you.

&quot;Nah...I am good.  Maybe throw in a small bag with the pink.&quot;

&quot;Okay then.  //Business//.  No pleasure, gotcha.  How much did you bring?&quot;

You hand Mitch $180.

Mitch looks at the bills with disappointment.  &quot;This isn&#39;t enough,&quot; he informs you.

&quot;What the fuck?&quot;

&quot;Supply and demand, my dear.  This batch is //$400// and I will throw in an eighth for free.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t bring that much.&quot;  //Or have that much left either….//

&quot;Ohoho!  Suddenly the free bowl sounds nice, eh?  Might as well smoke and chill with me...I am sure we can work something out,&quot; Mitch says to you with a lazy wink.

[[You feel sick]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="360" name="You feel sick" tags="" position="12887,17885" size="100,100">You release a trembling sigh.  Every fiber of your rational being is screaming at you to leave Mitch&#39;s cesspool but your eyes just rest heavily on the bong.  You feel like absolute shit.  You just want to feel //better//...even if it involves being with Mitch.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bong.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Blub. Blub. Blub…./// You smoke the bong and burn through the bowl, filling your little lungs to capacity with pungent smoke.

As you exhale in a storm of coughing, you feel blessed relief wash over you.

Mitch smokes a bowl as well and you look over at him and feel a familiar sexual tension rise.

//No sense fighting the inevitable...//

[[Pleasure Mitch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="361" name="Pleasure Mitch" tags="" position="13045,17988" size="100,100">You take off your shirt but leave your bra on.  With a self-satisfied grin, Mitch stands and strips naked from the waist down.  Mitch sees you staring at his cock and shakes his hips side to side, sending his meaty cock bouncing around in front of you. 

&quot;What are you waiting for, Taylor?&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocksuck3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As you have many times before, you begin to suck Mitch off.  As you lick up and down his length you are suddenly struck by how //routine// this horrible act now feels.  Worse yet, you are now uncomfortably familiar with Mitch&#39;s junk.  It&#39;s shape, its veiny texture.  It&#39;s foul smell and sour, bitter taste.  Even more disturbing is that you have now learned Mitch&#39;s preferences as well.  You soon have him groaning in pleasure as he erupts in your mouth.

&quot;Guhhh ew...&quot;

[[You hope that earned you a few days of drug induced bliss.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="362" name="You hope that earned you a few days of drug induced bliss." tags="" position="12890,18030" size="100,100">&quot;Okay, I will knock off $50 for that.&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot;  You wipe away Mitch&#39;s semen with the back of your hand.

&quot;I will tell you what...how about this: I have something special here.  You try some with me and then we&#39;ll fuck.  You leave with a big fat bag and a new buzz.  And I will make sure you cum at least once too, since I am a nice guy.&quot;

&quot;What do you want me to try?&quot;

Mitch removes a random t-shirt covering a small case and reveals a pile of white powder already formed into two long lines.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocaine.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
&quot;Oh hell no!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like taking things up my fucking nose!&quot;

Mitch rolls his eyes and laughs at you.  &quot;No, you just take things up every other damn hole you have.  Compared to what we did last time I think defiling your cute little nose is pretty tame,&quot; Mitch jeers at you.

You look down at the cocaine.  You almost feel a metaphorical devil and angel appear on your shoulders.

&quot;Drugs are bad!  Cocaine leads to heart attacks!  It is expensive!&quot; shouts the angel Taylor.

&quot;Exactly!&quot; interjects the devil Taylor.  &quot;Expensive shit offered for free!?  Sign me up!  What&#39;s the point of living to ninety if your life is boring and shitty?  I bet it feels fucking awesome-wait I don&#39;t even have to guess because I already know it is awesome!  Do the drugs!  Bang Mitch!  Get more drugs!  Fucking genius plan, Taylor, do it!&quot; urges the devil.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="363" name="Try the cocaine." tags="" position="12989,18200" size="100,100">Mitch gives you a small pile of powder, a dose that looks about ten times the size of what he forced you to try weeks earlier.  You know you should refuse, but repeating your past experience has a very strong appeal- especially if you are not paying for it.  Besides, you enjoyed yourself the first time and so hope this experience will be ten times as fantastic.

You position the cocaine in front of your nose, close one nostril, and inhale as you had seen in the movies.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taybump.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your nose goes numb and your heart starts pounding.  You immediately feel euphoric.  You are suddenly wide awake, confident you could conquer the entire fucking world.

//Wow...I was feeling like shit earlier...and now...//  Now, you have never felt better.

“Let’s go to my room,” Mitch suggests.

Your fantastic high is only minutely blunted.  

Mitch runs a hand down your arm.

“Uh…”  Mitch’s touch makes your arm tingle abnormally.  Mitch grabs your hand and you let him lead you back into his room...the place of so many awful and awesome memories…  As soon as you are through the threshold, he grabs your breasts and fondles you roughly.

Maybe next time!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="365" name="Days go by…" tags="" position="14748,4553" size="100,100">After what seems like days, you finally have a moment where you realize that you are becoming more clear headed and conscious of your surroundings.  The sounds of the murmuring voices and whirring machines around you eventually become more distinct.

“They were keeping you sedated on purpose,” a familiar voice whispers.  //Damien...is that you?//  “I put in blank saline.  There is something really weird going on here, Taylor.  They want you comatose.  The meeting was over //days// ago.  //The staff declared this all an elaborate hoax!//  Yet I seen what happened to you with my own eyes.  I have no idea what is happening but they obviously intend to move you and cover up your transformation.”

“Fruckkk…” you groan.  Your curse comes out slurred, but slurred words were still better than none.

“It is obvious that are big powers at play now,” Damien continues.  “I don’t know if it is the government or a corporation or what but you have to get out of here before you get carted off to like...Area 51 or some shit.”

You feel helpless.  You are dizzy and scared.  You don’t want to die - or go to where aliens go to die!

“Herrlp me, pwrease…” [[you beg.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="366" name="Go to the fucking hospital!" tags="" position="4059,3039" size="100,100">You do the only logical thing you can think of.
“I need to get to the fucking hospital!” you shriek as you attempt to run out the front door and nearly crash into it in your haste.  Your new gait and bobbing breasts, your longer hair, your resized body and limbs, everything serves to confound your senses.  In your rush and natural awkwardness, you find that you almost fall down the steps leading up to your house.
//I have to hurry!// a voice inside your mind screams.  For all you know, your condition may become permanent after a small time period, or could be contagious, or deadly, or irreversible or...//I just have to get help!//

Although you originally felt physically fine, suddenly a wave of nauseousness rolls over you as you fret about your condition.

You see a bus coming down the road and get on with your student pass when it stops.  As you take an awkward standing position, you are nearly thrown from your position as the bus lurches forward and resumes its route.
You feel a cold sweat break out as you stand and ride.  You pass the stop where you would have exited for school and keep riding until you are outside the large university hospital’s emergency room.
Every step makes your heart beat faster.  You become almost frantic by the time you reach the hospital.
You stagger forward and run into the emergency department with your arms flailing.

[[Enter the emergency department]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="367" name="Go to school like usual" tags="" position="3754,3038" size="100,100">As you step onto the next bus no one gives you much of a second glance, except for a few creepy men sitting towards the back of the bus that make no effort to hide the fact they are ogling you and enjoying the view.

You glance down at your prominent chest and notice how obvious your shirt frames your new breasts.  //Fuck maybe I should have worn something thicker…// It was too late now and too hot anyway to be comfortable.  //That’s right- I am going to be uncomfortable no matter where I go like this, so I might as well get used to it.//

Once on campus you instantly feel safer.  You find your way into the science building where Mr. Deter’s psych class is held.  You see Evan standing alone fiddling with his phone.

You realize you feel surprisingly nervous.  You aren&#39;t completely sure how to approach your friend.  Seeing no other choice, you take a deep breath and walk up to him.

“Hey Evan,” you greet your friend.

Even looks up at raises an eyebrow at your approach.  “Julie?  Where is Tay--...” his voice cuts off with a note of confusion as he studies your face.  “What-the-fuck?” he says after you stand before him for a long moment.

[[“What the fuck indeed,” you reply.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="368" name="Enter the emergency department" tags="" position="4216,3095" size="100,100">“Fucking help me!” you scream once you are inside.  A man holding a bloody stump for a hand lets you pass with a look of surprised awe.
“Please!  You guys have to help me!  I have transformed into a fucking girl!” you yell at the receptionist.
“You what?” the confused looking woman sitting at the desk blinks at your explanation for requesting medical care.
“I transformed into a girl!  I need serious help!” you repeat your request.
“You sure do…” the receptionist replies dryly.
“Oh my… page psych immediately!  We are going to need a drug panel as well, I bet this chick is tripping balls,” loudly advises an attending physician.
“No, I don’t need a fucking psychiatrist!” you scream at them.  “I am completely sober!  These boobs just appeared out of fucking nowhere!!  Like BAM-BOOBS!  They aren’t in my mind!  They are real!” you shout as you grab at your chest.  You are aware you are making a scene but you can’t stop yourself.  You know you should be calm, but that seems impossible given the frustration you feel given your sudden and unbelievable transformation.  “I need like a //geneticist!//&quot; you yell at the hospital staff.  &quot;This is like super important!  I am a man but I fell asleep and I transformed into a girl while I was sleeping!  Please, you have to believe me!  This is fucking insane!  I need like //major// help!”
“Okay...uh, Miss…”
“My name is Taylor, not //miss!//”
“I see, and how did... this “transformation” happen to you, Taylor?”
“I don’t know!  Can you imagine the potentially crazy conspiracy at play?  I am just a normal student!  I bet the fucking government is involved!  Or maybe aliens!  Holy fuck---//The government// and //aliens.//” 
You may have just blown your own mind.
A very confused looking male nurse leads you into one of the emergency treatment rooms.
You feel relieved when a doctor arrives and does some basic tests.  He checks your blood pressure, does a blood draw, listens to your heart, and does a cursory physical examination.
Eventually a second doctor appears.  The second doctor is hugely overweight.  You notice his name tag says “Psychiatrics: Dr. Berber”
“Oh great, the fucking shrink has arrived,” you comment as the doctor lumbers up to you.

[[Talk to the shrink]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="369" name="Talk to the shrink" tags="" position="4060,3191" size="100,100">“Hello Taylor, My name is Dr. Berber.  I am going to ask you some questions, okay?”
“What about my tests?  Did you find out how I transformed into a girl?” you interrupt the doctor.
“Yeah, your tests came back.  You are a perfectly healthy young lady.  No medical issues that we can see.”
“I am not a girl!” you protest.
Dr.Berber bites at his lip but his expression remains neutral.
“You think you are a man, correct?”
“Of course I am a fucking man!”
“Mhmm….Do you admire men?”
“What do you mean?  I am a guy...and yeah it is pretty sweet… hence why I want to return to the way I was….”
“Hmm...I see.  Have you ever heard of gender dysphoria?”
“What?  No...I don’t think you are understanding me.  I don’t want to be a man--well I do I guess...fuck… but only because I turned into a chick!”  //Fuck that sounds so dumb...//  You rephrase, “I am man trapped in a woman’s body and I need to find a way to transform back into my original male body!”  //Fuck...that sounds almost as bad.//
[[Keep chatting with the doc]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="370" name="You enter a state of dreamless sleep" tags="" position="4060,3338" size="100,100">You wake up in an isolation cell.  //Fucking great!  I am in the god-damned looney bin now!// you think as you look around your room, obviously designed for some “suicide watch” type holding scenario.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/isolation2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You feel groggy...disconnected...and very troubled.
“Oh yeah…” you look down at your breasts carefully tenting your shirt.
“I transformed into a girl!  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccck!”
At that moment the door opens.
Dr. Berber enters and sits down near the bed.
“I am still a girl,” you say in disbelief.  “But I am not a girl…”
“I see you are still confused.”  Dr.Berber holds a mirror towards you.
You take in the pretty young face.
“What do you see?”
“A girl…”
“Yes, that’s you.  You are unmistakably female.”
“No!  I am only temporarily a girl...I hope.  I am really a man.  I was born a man!”
“Taylor, we have examined you.  There is no evidence of sexual reassignment surgery or hormones.  You are undeniably a real woman and your confusion over this fact has us quite concerned.”
You scowl at the doctor.  “Fuck you!  This bullshit isn’t why I came here!”
“Well I have you under a seventy two hour observation hold until we can determine if you are a danger to yourself or others.  You aren’t having any violent impulses are you?” the Doctor asks you in such an annoyingly insufferable tone that you just barely resist the urge to smack the doctor across his smug ass face.
“FUCK YOU!” you scream at Dr. Berber.  He looks at you with pity and leaves.  You are left alone for the next 24 hours except for infrequent meals.  

[[Wait in isolation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="371" name="Wait in isolation" tags="" position="4211,3394" size="100,100">The next day Dr. Berber returns.  “You were not wearing ID when you came in.  What is your last name, Taylor?  How can we get in touch with your parents?” he questions you.
Your treatment so far has made you wary and exceptionally defensive.  “Fuck off, doc.  I promise I won’t cut off my tits, I doubt that will help me get my penis back anyway.  I want to be released right fucking now.”
“Hmm...&quot;Cut off tits...&quot;&quot;Your penis...back&quot;….hmm…” Berber notes your words on his pad.
“And fucking stop writing down everything I say!”
“Violent impulses….excessive profanity…..”
“Stop it!  Stop it!”
“Uncontrollable compulsion to be in control…Potentially significant mental break...potential psychopath warning signs...”
“Doc, you are a fucking prick!  I see where this is going!  I am not going to be tricked by you fucking assholes!  I shouldn’t have came to your shitty hospital in the first place.”
“High degree of paranoia….”//It isn&#39;t paranoia if it is fucking true!// 
&quot;You are out to get me!&quot;
&quot;//Excessive// paranoia...&quot; he upgrades your delusion.
“AHHH!  Stop that!” you scream at him as you snap.  You lunge at the doctor in an effort to wring his infuriating little windpipe and destroy his destestible little notepad.
Your slender hands wrap around the doctor’s throat.  You see his look of surprise and can’t help but squeeze with all your feeble might.  The doctor gives a facsimile of a scream as your grip tightens.  You laugh as his stupid, smug smile finally disappears from his face.  
Just when you feel like you might be going too far and should release him, you suddenly look up and see two burly orderlies enter the room.  They tackle you to the ground and pin your arms and legs.  They are so much stronger than you all you can do is flop in vain as one of them presses a syringe into your butt cheek.
The wave of fatigue returns as you are sedated.  The last thing you see is Dr.Berber and a small council of doctors gesturing angrily in your direction.

You have long since admitted you have mental issues and that you need serious help in order to cope your deep seated trauma.

All of your days are exactly the same.  The doctors of the facility believe that such routine helps establish a sense of normalcy that can improve the quality of life of their patients.

With Dr.Berber’s help, you have come a long way in accepting that you have always been a woman.  Although some of his therapy methods seem unorthodox...

“I woman...but am a boy, too...right?” you question a shadow in the moonlight.

The shadow does not reply.  So you respond to yourself, mumbling incoherently about a boy that isn’t a boy and all the awful things that should never have been yet still happened anyway.  You fear that you may have gone completely insane, but at least here at Mooringham you will be able to get the help you so desperately need.

“So….the government turned me into a girl?” you venture with a raised eyebrow.

“No, you ignoramus!  The government has been co-opted by corporate power!  They are indistinguishable from each other and run by the same damned people.”

“Are you going to start ranting about the Federal Reserve next?” you wonder.

Mr. Deter’s eyes bulge with rage.  “Don’t get me started on the //Federal fucking Reserve//!  About as “Federal” as Federal Express!  A private banking cartel controlling the most important economy in the entire world?  The most powerful unelected positions in the country-the world!  The Fed is a cancerous blight upon the people that steals the wealth of the prudent and elderly via inflation and funnels the spigots of free money directly into the hands of those who already have far too much!!”

“Yeah… probably. But what have you learned in regards to me transforming into a fucking girl?”

Mr.Deter’s rage disappears, replaced with a self satisfied smirk.  “Well. Taylor, as for what I learned...how about we try //Protocol One// again?”

The two words make your temples throb.  //Wait, what words?  What did he just say?  What the fuck just happened!?  I can’t remember...//

[[You feel yourself space out for a moment]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="375" name="You feel yourself space out for a moment" tags="" position="8778,9004" size="100,100">“Hello?  Taaaylor?  Are you alright?” you hear Mr. Deter calling you.

You blink.  “Yeah I am fine...I was just…”

“You were just taking off your clothes.”

“What?  No….was I?”

You feel disoriented and your head throbs, intensifying its dull ache.

“You said you were going to take off your clothes and come over here and pleasure me.  Don’t go back on your word, Taylor.”

“I didn’t say that...I wouldn’t...I mean...I don’t remember…”

“Do it, take off your clothes,” Deter commands.  “A man’s word is his bond, yes?”

//No, this is mega-fucked up!  I have to get out of here...something is wrong...I can’t seem to think straight.//

Mr.Deter walks by you and locks the bolt on his office door.

He then turns and faces you, staring you down with his imperious gaze.  To you absolute dismay and utter horror, you see your shaking hands slowly rise.  //No, what the fuck!?//  You cannot seem to control your actions.  Your hands move unbidden, unbuttoning your top.  You feel like you have been possessed, like a spirit is directing control of your movements.  Your entire body is now moving of its own accord, as if your brain now has no control over its own charge.  You mentally shriek in terror as you strip down completely naked before your professor.

Deter grins at your naked body and undresses himself with astonishing speed.

“Now pleasure me Taylor and I will share with you some very important information.  Get on with it,” orders your teacher.

[[Pleasure Deter]]

You will your body to run away but instead you begin to mechanically jerk Mr.Deter off.  His hot, old, gross dick hardens in your tiny hand.  Soon both of your hands are gently rubbing up and down your demented teacher’s dick.  Mr. Deter towers over you and his boner begins to press into the firm flesh below your belly button, giving you an uncomfortable reminder of your circumstances.  For a split second, you imagine Deter thrusting inside you and you nearly vomit.  You are suddenly perversely glad that you only have to use your hands.

After a minute of gentle pumping, Mr. Deter begins to breathe heavily, his large belly and cock periodically rubbing against you as he thrusts forward in pleasure.  

“Ohhh yeah…” Mr. Deter moans as his penis bulges and shakes in your grasp, covering your delicate hands with a thick layer of smelly white cum.

//At least this is over...// you think to yourself with a feeling of relief counterbalanced by a modcum of shame.  //It wasn&#39;t my fault... I couldn&#39;t control myself!// you rationalize.

“Lick yourself clean,” orders Mr.D.

Your heart skips several beats.  “What!?  No fucking way, not for a million dollars!”

“This is an //order,// Taylor,” Deter clarifies, as if that detail is significant.

You momentarily go blind.  The buzzing sound returns in your ears, like a cacophony of madness, the sound and arcing pain drives you backwards.  You feel like you might die or pass out. You find yourself falling but luckily land on one of Deter’s office chairs.  You feel your neck and head jerk and move spastically.  //Am...I having a seizure?//
[[You wake up from your strange trance]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="377" name="You wake up from your strange trance" tags="" position="8766,9145" size="100,100">
You blink your eyes rapidly.  You feel like you just woke up from a deep sleep, the last remnants of a confusing dream slip away from the edge of your consciousness.

“Taylor!” Mr. Deter shouts at you.

You snap out of your reverie.  “Yes, Mr. Deter?”

You follow Mr.D’s eyes down to your awkwardly cradled hand.  Your feminine hand is covered with semen.  It looks like you just jacked off...instead now you are not a guy...and the only other source of….//EW!!  What the fuck just happened!?//

“Lick yourself clean,” Mr. Deter repeats his order.  //He wants me to...What!?  NO FUCKING WAY!//

&quot;Fuck you!&quot; you screech.  

&quot;Quiet!&quot;

With no input on your part, your hand suddenly rises to your face, cutting off your objections.  You try and scream at the top of your lungs but no sound emerges from your throat.  Instead, despite your internal screams, your tongue slowly extends and touches your palm and Deter’s seed.  //Noooooooooooooooooooooo!//  The absolutely revolting taste makes you want to vomit, but your body just eagerly continues to lick your hand until it is clean, with only the shiny remnants of your saliva remaining.

“Excellent work, Taylor!” your professor compliments you as you lap up the last of his cum.

You now have an absolutely foul aftertaste lingering on your lips.

&lt;3 Tango</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="379" name="Finish the drive" tags="" position="2505,14497" size="100,100">After an hour long drive down a bumpy road, the two of you arrive safely at the cabin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cabin.JPG&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The cabin is a nice little place.  Cozy and isolated but also well stocked with amenities.  Every year previous to this, you have felt a great sense of excitement when you arrived at the cabin.  This year...alone with Evan...in your new female body...you feel more nervous than excited.  //I can’t believe I came out here with Evan like this….//

Evan unlocks the cabin and the two of you proceed to carry your gear inside.  It only takes about ten minutes after you have unpacked before Evan takes out his dick.

“Are you kidding?” you ask your friend as you stare in disbelief at his cock.

“Oh come on Taylor.  Let’s not do this all again.  You knew what you were getting into when you got into the car alone with me.  This is going to be a weekend of fun!  We are going to feast and fuck all weekend,” he informs you.

“Feast and fuck, eh?”  //I do enjoy both of those things...//

You watch Evan strip until he is standing naked and erect before you.
Evan moves close to you.  “This is the perfect place to experiment…” he whispers to you as he pulls your shirt over your head.

//I am such a moron...// you think as you let Evan undress you. 
“How about we try a sixty-nine?  I bet I can make you cum first!”
“Hmm…”  You can’t help but sigh.  “Challenge accepted.”

Evan grins at you and lies down on the floor.  A few moments of hesitation later, you mount Evan so that your pussy is over top of his face.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evan69.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You begin to suck on your friend.  You caress his shaft and try and force his length as deep into you as possible.  As your efforts increase, so too do Evan’s.  It soon becomes a sexy competition, the sounds of both of your pleasurable moaning filling the cabin.  You are fairly competitive, so you end up putting forward your best efforts.  Yet despite this, you somehow find yourself losing to Evan.  His rapid, shallow penetrations and swirling tongue on your clit drive you wild, until you find yourself riding Evan’s face as you cum.
“Ahhhhhhhhh!” you scream in ecstasy as your orgasm’s warm pleasure radiates through your body.
[[Let Evan finish]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="381" name="Let Evan finish" tags="" position="2500,14647" size="100,100">Your pleasure causes you to forget your task.  Evan rolls you over onto the floor and stands up, jerking off into your already waiting open mouth.  You accept his cum without complaint, still a bit disappointed he somehow got the better of you.

“Holy fuck,” Evan pants as he jerks off the last few drops of semen into your mouth.  “Best start to a vacation //ever.//”
You just lie down on the floor and try and catch your breath.
“Let’s have a shower and then make some grub,” Evan suggests.

[[Have a shower with Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="382" name="Have a shower with Evan" tags="" position="2352,14753" size="100,100">You step into the shower with Evan.

Evan momentarily admires your backside before taking a position behind you.
&quot;What do you think you are doing there?&quot; you ask Evan as one of his muscled arms pulls you closer to him.

&quot;Nothin&#39;!&quot; he innocently replies as he places his erection between your legs.  Evan&#39;s cock is now pressed against your soft, wet thighs and dripping pussy.  Your friend slowly begins to fuck your thighs without actual penetration.  His hot length spreading open your aching, wet lips as he slides back and forth along your opening.
&quot;Oh…&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Taylor?&quot; Evan teases you.  He grabs a bottle of body wash from the shower&#39;s shelf and squirts it into his hands.  From your position, Evan&#39;s arms remind you of your old life and some hilarious improv antics.  &quot;I will help get you squeaky clean!&quot; [[Evan whispers to you.]]

“How long have you wanted to be a man?” he asks you next.
“What the fuck?  I have wanted to transform back into a man since the moment I turned into….//this,//” you say, while gesturing at your chest and figure.
“I see.”  Dr.Berber nods sagely.  “Have you always preferred masculine activities?”
“...Uh, of course.”
“And this “transformation” as you call it, it occured around the onset of puberty, correct?”
“What the fuck!?  No!  This //just// happened to me!  What the hell is wrong with you, doctor?”
The doctor sighs with irritation and stands.  “Can you please get me some Ativan to calm her down?” you overhear Dr.Berber make a request of a nurse.  He seems to be giving the young woman even more instructions.  //Fuck!  Why won’t these assholes take me seriously?//
“No drugs!” you shout at the pair of medical professionals.
“Taylor, please!  This is just to make you relax a little bit!” Berber explains.
“Fuck off!  Treat my transformation not my fucking brain!  Read my fucking lips!”
“Your condition appears to be neurological, not physical,” Dr.Berber replies.
“You mother fuckers aren’t listening to me!!” you explode once you exceed peak frustration.
“Taylor, you need to calm down!” advises the Doctor.
“I am fucking calm!” you scream as you throw a tissue box at Dr. Berber’s head.  The box sails through the air, striking Berber right in the middle of his square face like a soft brick.
“Ow!  That’s it!  She is //violent!//  Nurse, sedate her immediately!” orders the Doctor.

“Nooooooo!” you howl in frustration as a wave of fatigue washes over you.  It suddenly becomes very hard to keep your eyes open.  “I am not a girl….” you feebly mumble as you submit to the beckoning darkness.

You are shocked to see a photograph of yourself topless.  You are pictured passed out sitting on a toilet.  Your breasts, neck, and chin are absolutely covered in cum, you realize with horror.  //Wait...who&#39;s cum is that?...Oh god…//  The reality of your situation and a vague memory of the events of last night slowly sinks in.  //He raped me!  That fucking scumbag!//  It all comes back to you in a flash.  You feel the urge to throw up, and it has nothing to do with your hangover.

//What have I done?// You despair as flashbacks and fragments of the previous night return to the forefront of your mind.  You suddenly remember Mitch rubbing his dick all over your cheeks and lips and then ejaculating all over your chest.  //And my face!// You think with revulsion, a hand going to your mouth.  You feel angry but also humiliated as you realize his dried semen is still coating you, now breaking off of your lips in a dry crust.  In that same moment you become aware of the foul odor that pervades you.  You feel completely wretched and dirty.

You run to the bathroom have a shower and wash off Mitch&#39;s filth.  When you are finished you see the flashing light of another missed message.

“7 pm east dorm, building rear -M,” was all the message said.  Sent from what had to be Mitch’s number.

You stare angrily at the message.

You suddenly feel withdrawn, as if all the happiness had been sucked away, replaced with a nervous tension. You fall silent but nod in response to his question.  Being dishonest seems impossible in your current state.

“And did you delete it?” he presses.

You blink.  You feel too good to lie, it seems like doing so would taint the magic whirling around you.  Since everyone is psychically connected, lying would be impossible anyway.  “No,” you reply.

“So you kept it.  Did you look at it closely Taylor?  Did it remind you of our special night together?”

“...Yes,” you respond.

“Did you touch yourself while looking at my picture?” he asks you.

You feel like time stalls for a good fifteen seconds.  “Yes,” you answer when you unfreeze, your voice barely a whisper.

Mitch throws back his head and laughs uproariously.  “Good!  Now let’s get the heck out of here before one of your dumbass friends interrupt.”

“Interrupt what?” you ask.  As soon as the words leave your mouth, Mitch brings his own lips down upon yours.  Instead of revulsion you are overwhelmed by pink lightning bolts.

//It has to be the drugs,// you tell yourself.  You pull away breathless and shaking.  You have never had a kiss like that before.  You felt it all the way from your lips to the very tips of your toes.

You have always hated Mitch but right now you see only a young man, mutch like you used to be.  You cannot help but relate and feel a bit sorry for him.  It wasn’t long ago that you had such desires as well.  

You look up at Mitch and find yourself thinking that anything is possible tonight.  Even two enemies becoming friends or lovers.

Mitch wraps an arm around your waist and the two of you leave the party together.

It is a short walk to Mitch’s apartment.  You keep getting distracted by the twinkling stars above.  When you reach the building, you find the stairs difficult but Mitch helps you up them.  As Mitch unlocks his door you feel the pink tablet’s magic continue to flow over you.  You become absolutely certain that anything is possible, even love and peace with asomeone as terrible as Mitch.

[[Go inside]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="386" name="Rhea beckons you forward with her index finger." tags="" position="2999,9949" size="100,100">You look around the circle, all eyes are upon you.  You feel your face burning up, whether it is from alcohol, arousal, or embarrassment, or some kind of combination thereof you cannot tell.  You submit to your fate, crawling through the center of the circle.  Your eyes meet Rhea’s and you move in closer.  It was now your time to attack!  You press your lips firmly against Rheas.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheataykiss2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Rhea pulls you in closer craning her neck and pushing her chin upward to meet you.

“Mmmm……”

Your kiss lingers...too fucking long.  

“Oh-my-god, Taylor!  You’re such a cute little kisser!” Rhea teases you when you pull apart.  The mischievous smile she gives you sends a troupe of butterflies fluttering through your stomach.  You are beginning to suspect Rhea is bisexual and more than enjoying her time messing with you.

Rhea gives you a dimpled smile and gives her long, shiny blonde hair a shake.  //Fuck...it doesn’t matter if I am a guy or girl….Rhea is still a total fucking babe!//

The game continues on.  You laugh your ass off when Jimmy is forced to kiss Evan.  You let him get away with a peck on the cheek.

Evan is then forced to kiss Rhea.  “All the kisses are mine!” Rhea exults.

[[When Sam spins she also lands on Rhea.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="387" name="When Sam spins she also lands on Rhea." tags="" position="2851,10043" size="100,100">“This bottle game is rigged!” complains Evan.  “Not that I am complaining too much,” he adds as he eagerly leans in to watch Sam and Rhea.

Sam blushes until her face nearly matches her hair.

“Come here, beautiful!” Rhea coos as she pulls Sam in, taking the initiative and kissing her like a pair of long lost lovers reuniting.

As you watch Rhea make out with Sam, your emotions return to the forefront of your mind and do battle.  You wish you were the one kissing Sam...but you can’t quite seem to draw your eyes away from the two.  //Two of the most beautiful women I have ever seen...are making out right in front of me!//

The spinning continues until you are dizzy.  After about half an hour you have been kissed by or kissed every person present...except Sam.

You’re disappointed but find that Rhea is a worthy substitute.  Rhea spin the bottle and as it slowly comes to a stop in front of Evan Rhea grabs the bottle and twists it so it finishes pointing at you.  

“That’s cheating!” you and Evan protest in unison.

“Whatever gets me what I want,” Rhea purrs.  She crawls in for another round and you oblige her, your earlier nervousness is nowhere to be found.

“Mmmm….” you let a moan slip through your lips as Rhea parts them and explores your mouth.

“Mhmmm!” agrees Rhea.

“You two are getting a bit carried away,” observes Evan. 

Rhea cackles in delight.  “That is impossible!” she says in between kisses.  “Taylor is just too damn cute!”

[[Continue kissing Rhea]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="388" name="Continue kissing Rhea" tags="" position="2999,10097" size="100,100">//I am making out with Rhea!//  You feel a bit weird, but Rhea is a gorgeous woman and, as she kisses you, you find that fact seems more important that your own...circumstances.  You would have once given your left nut to spend a night with a looker like Rhea...yet now it seemed you had to sacrifice //both// your nuts just to get a chance.  “Mmm...that feels so good…” //Maybe it would even be worth the trade….//

“Hey, enough you two!  It is my turn,” Jimmy interrupts.  He spins the bottle and it stops directly on Evan.  “Fuck this game, I quit!” Jimmy shouts in frustration as he gets up and heads to the kitchen to fix another drink.

The rest of you laugh.  The game disintegrates and you return to the couches in the living room.  For some reason, Rhea follows you eagerly and sits beside you.

You look over at Rhea, beautiful and glowing in the soft light.  Your heart begins to beat faster, while Rhea’s intoxicating fragrance causes you to take deep breaths to inhale her heady, alluring scent.  Rhea crosses her long legs and gives you a naughty smile.  You had hung out with Rhea a dozen times or so before...and she never shown this must interest in you.

You swallow nervously and Rhea giggles at your obvious unease.  //Just another “perk” of being a hot chick...//

Rhea suddenly kisses you again and you are shocked at her aggressiveness.  She seems determined to kiss you until you beg her to stop.

You try and tell her to stop, but you find yourself literally tongue tied.

After who knows how long, you manage to untangle yourself from Rhea and enter the kitchen.  It is already after 1 am and you debate heading home just as Rhea joins you in the kitchen.

Rhea sashays over to a nearby table and pours two shot glasses full of tequila.

She hands you a glass and you look down at the shivering golden liquid.

Rhea gently pushes the glass to your lips with an impish smile gracing her full lips.

&quot;Cheers!&quot;

[[You return to the living room with Rhea]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="389" name="Rhea laughs at you" tags="" position="3000,10253" size="100,100">“We are //just// getting started,” Rhea informs you, as she renews her kissing offensive.

Her lips and hands coax a long moan from you.  It is at that moment you look around the party, everyone seems to be watching you and Rhea…  //Fuck!  Ah---whatever!  It doesn’t fucking matter!  Rhea is a hot chick and I am a red-blooded man!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheataykiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You begin to more aggressively respond to Rhea’s advances.  You kiss her back with more force.  You push her own tongue out of your mouth and invade your rival’s in kind.  You feel a soft, fleshy bounce as your hand covers Rhea’s breast.

Rhea pulls away in shock, if it wasn’t so dark you might even have thought Rhea was blushing a bit herself.

It only takes Rhea a second to recover.  She looks at your face...and then your hand. She then grins at you.

Her leering grin is something you would have once imagined could only be possessed by a succubus. Now here you are, held completely in the demon Rhea’s thrall.

“Hey, Taylor,” Rhea begins, while making an overt effort to lick her lips.  Let’s go upstairs,” she suggests.

You would have once leapt at the suggestion.  Yet now, as you look down at your own heaving breasts, you are unsure what to even do in such a situation.

[[Go upstairs with Rhea]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="390" name="Go upstairs with Rhea" tags="" position="2847,10351" size="100,100">Whether you are a man or woman, it hardly matters anymore.  Rhea is beautiful and willing and you find yourself literally dripping with arousal.

“Let’s go upstairs,” you agree.  Rhea grabs your hand and leads you upstairs to her room.  As you scramble up the stairs, you notice Evan and Jimmy giving you a thumbs up...and also a somewhat despondent looking Sam standing off to the side.

You instantly forget about your other friends, for soon Rhea has you locked inside her room. The alluring Rhea captivates you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/rheaallure.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

She giggles at you as she throws her shirt aside with a graceful toss.  You lose yourself in Rhea’s breasts for a moment and are shocked when she pounces on you, deftly stripping off your clothes and pushing you down upon the bed.

[[Have sex with Rhea]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="391" name="Have sex with Rhea" tags="" position="2995,10397" size="100,100">Rhea descends upon, kissing you passionately while running her hands all over your body.  You try and fight back, but Rhea’s experienced hands leave you defenseless and trembling before the young woman’s erotic might.

“Wow, Taylor...you’re //soaked.//  I totally had you pegged as a lez-bo too!” Rhea laughs as she removes her glistening hand and licks off some of your juices.

“I am not a--”  //Fuck maybe I technically am...fucking hell!  Shut up, brain!//

“Wow you //taste so fucking good,// Taylor,” Rhea whispers.

//I can’t take it anymore!//  

“Ahhhhhhhhhh!” you loudly moan as Rhea begins to schlick up and down your slit while swirling another soft, practiced finger around your clit until you are convulsing underneath the blonde succubus, your body rocked with an intense orgasm.

“Soooo cute~!” Rhea gushes.

You try and and sit up but find even that difficult.  Rhea resumes her assault, teasing and biting at your lips until your passions have been fully inflamed.

You finally work up your strength and when Rhea draws off to catch her breath, you attack her.  You try and do your best imitation of what Rhea just did to you only in reverse.  At first Rhea resists, but your persistent nibbling and kissing eventually pushes her onto her back.

You pull Rhea’s pants off with a determined glint in your eye.

Rhea just smirks up at you, confident in her erotic might.  Eager for an upset, you lean forward and pull her panties off in one smooth motion.  Your actions reveal a cute little pussy framed with a shock of golden hair.  You also can see that Rhea is also clearly aroused, as proven by the sheen of clear fluid dripping down her thighs.

“Okay, Taylor, I will help you out,” Rhea says with a giggle as she unhooks her bra and lets her glorious, huge breasts fall free.
You can’t help but make an internal //hnnnngghhh// noise, some manly instinct rearing its head like a coyote howling at the moon.
[[You delicately probe Rhea’s vagina.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="392" name="You delicately probe Rhea’s vagina." tags="" position="2847,10495" size="100,100">It’s heat and wetness guides you forth.

“Oh that feels so good!” Rhea moans as you begin to work your fingers faster and deeper into her waiting flesh.

“You’re pretty wet too, Rhea,” you playfully chide your partner.
Rhea pouts but you keep working on her, yet your movements don’t have quite the same level of effect on Rhea as hers did on you.

After a bit of effort you have Rhea flooding with love juice but you can’t //quite// seem to make her cum.

“Fuck me, Taylor,” Rhea requests.

You blink.  You wish you could.  //But maybe I can…? Fine! ...if Rhea wants it, I’ll fuck her...!!//

You suddenly mount Rhea, as you would if you still had your cock.
As your hot genitals meet, you feel a warm tingle spread from your nether regions while a shock of electricity shoots up your spine.

Rhea giggles at your distress.  You find her haughty attitude to be immensely annoying.  You desperately want to wipe the smirk from her beautiful face.

You begin to grind against Rhea, your labia and vaginas press together you feel a spreading warmth begin to consume you.  There is a fire lit deep within you, and once stoked, it begins to rage and burn until that feeling and the beautiful naked woman in front of you is all you can think about.  //God damnit, Rhea!  I so wish I had my cock right now, I’d ...fuck you real good...ahh….maybe I still can.  Well I can’t really penetrate her...but I can hump her to death!  Prepare to die, Rhea!  Death by snu snu!//

You begin to ride and grind against Rhea with everything you have. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lesbian.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
At first Rhea appears quite shocked at your aggressive turn around, but eventually a contagious and very erotic smile creeps across her face.  Rhea bites her lip.

“You’re so //bad,// Taylor!  I //knew// it!  Fuck yes!  Ohh...Yeah baby, work that pussy!” Rhea urges you.

With Rhea’s stunning, buxom naked body in front of you, there is no chance of you holding back.  Fucking a knockout blonde was something you had always dreamed off.  You had often enjoyed a good lesbian video too...you just never thought you would experience the sex first hand.
Your manly impulses seize control over you as you begin to fuck Rhea like it is your last night on Earth.

[[Continue your night with Rhea]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="393" name="Continue your night with Rhea" tags="" position="2991,10549" size="100,100">“Ohhhh!  Keep going….yeah right //there….//” Rhea encourages you. “Ohhhh yessss!  Taaaaaaaaylor!!” 

You find Rhea’s sweet spot and drape one of your hands between your slick sexes.  You gently shake your hand, hopping the extra light petting feels as good for Rhea as it does for you.  The external stimulation nearly puts you over the edge as well.  //Holy fuck this feels amazing!//

You glance at your partner’s face and there can be no doubt she is enjoying this...maybe even as much as you are, as difficult as that may be to believe. //Oh my god!  I am having sex with a hot chick….as a hot chick!//  You aren’t sure how that makes you feel, aside undeniably turned on.  

Eventually you feel yourself nearing an ultimate climax.  You look at Rhea and she returns you a lustful, knowing look.  Rhea is covered with a sheen of bright sweat, she looks like a blonde haired goddess glowing in the light.  You can’t help yourself but unleash a young man’s sexual urges upon Rhea, mashing your genitals together until you are sodden, twitching, and lying satisfied upon a soaked bedsheet.

“Holy fuck, Rhea….”

Rhea grins at you.  “Holy fuck, Taylor!  That was //fun!//”

Your sex continues until you are both raw and sore.

“We need a strap on next time,” Rhea says to you hours later.

“Next time…?”

“What?  You didn’t enjoy yourself, honey?” Rhea pouts.

“Uh...no I had a good time…a //really// good time...” you admit.

Rhea just smiles knowingly at you.

[[“Well...you know where I live if you want a repeat,” Rhea offers.]]

You try and spend some time searching for leads on the internet but you soon find your thoughts wandering.  You end up heading to a favorite porn website and searching “sexy lesbians.”  The results are quite pleasing to the eye.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lesb.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//This is perfect,// you think.  Looking at heterosexual porn lately has been seriously weirding you out.  //I am a guy who loves women residing in a woman’s body, so why not find a woman who likes women?//  

“I am so smart!” you praise yourself as you cum without a feeling of remorse. &quot;Ahhh...&quot;

You find that your phone draws your interest.

Soon the betting becomes too rich for Rhea’s blood and she drops out, leaving you head to head with Samantha’s twinkling eyes and enigmous smile.  For some reason she keeps raising.  With a bit of annoyance and a little spark of competitiveness, you match her raise for raise until you are close to all in on your first round.

//Fuck!  So much for playing it safe...//

Sam seems to love goading you forward; she is openly laughing at you now.  You have long desired to make Sam laugh...but you kind of hoped it wouldn’t be //at// you.

You wish your victory was more skill rather than luck based.

You figure your chance of winning is at about 60% at best. Losing now would be disastrous, yet victory would fulfill one of your greatest, most long standing dreams: to see Samantha Klein naked.

//That is a goal worth taking huge risks for!//

With a grimace you finally make your decision.  You decide to:
[[Call]]
[[Fold]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="396" name="Call" tags="" position="3450,9987" size="100,100">You decide to call Samantha’s bluff.  You look her right dead in her bright, pretty blue eyes and inform her, ”Call.”

Sam looks upset at your boldness, but, after a second, she shoots you a small smile as she lays her cards on the table in triumph.

//Fuuuuuck!//  You have lost…. //badly.//

“Oh, don’t look so disappointed!” Sam says with a grin as she scoops your chips away from you.  “Don’t worry!  I won’t strip you...//completely//.  Here’s a little something for your trouble,” she says with a laugh.  Sam throws you back a two chips rom her winnings so you can keep playing while Rhea sets a freshly mixed cocktail in front of you.

Stinging from your defeat, you are forced down to your underwear in front of your friends.

“Wooooooooo!” your friends cheer as you take off your clothing under a cloud of embarrassment.

Shielding your breasts with your arm, you endure a hail of jeers and booing.

“Booooooo! That’s no fair, Taylor! Arm-bra is //cheating!//” Rhea shouts while wagging her finger at you.

Evan’s voice joins the chorus of agreement. “That’s right! Don’t be a prude, Taylor!”

You look at a blushing Sam who seems fixated at a spot on the floor. Sam’s embarrassment only serves to worsen your own. //This is the worst! What the hell is Sam going to think of me?//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/boobs1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fuck…” Defeated, you stop your attempt at modesty. You lower your arm and bare your supple, young breasts for your friends.

The crowd approves. “Nooooiiiice!” Jimmy beams. 

Your face feels like it is about to burst into flames. “How much longer?”

“Just a bit more!” Evan answers. The seconds tick by, their passage marked by your rapidly beating heart.

You look around the table. Rhea is smirking at you. The men are googling you. You even notice [[Sam peeking at you through the spaces in her fingers.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="399" name="Listen to Deter&#39;s info" tags="" position="8634,9247" size="100,100">You feel the buzzing sensation in your ears recede.

“What just happened?”  You are fully clothed, seated in Mr. Deter’s office.  Although you have a weird taste in your mouth, no matter how hard you try, you cannot remember the last twenty minutes.

Deter ignores your question.  “Now, fair is fair, let’s get to the results… I will share with you a tiny glimpse of my genius!  You are //very// privileged,” Mr.D informs you.

“Just please get on with it.  Tell me what you have learned,” you request, while rubbing your throbbing temples.

Mr. Deter takes out a lab print out, filled with dozens of tiny tables filled with data.  He starts at the top, beginning to drone on about a bunch of shit that totally goes over your head.

“In addition, the chemical formula includes a dopamine binding agent...ahh,” Deter notices your uncomprehending face.  “I will try and speak like a normie: You have a particular odor that should make people around you more aroused and prone to suggestion… in practice, most subjects should show a more agreeable disposition towards you.”

“What the hell?  No one has been agreeable!  That doesn’t even make any sense… //if// it makes people agreeable…”

“More &quot;prone to suggestion,&quot;” Deter corrects you with an exasperated sigh.

“And why doesn’t it work on you?” you demand.

Mr. Deter raises an eyebrow as if you asked a really stupid question.  “I am not very agreeable,” he replies.

“Uh huh…”

“You generate one hundred and seventy three times the pheromones of a regular woman and should be prone to more frequent arousal,” Deter continues.  “Such traits are excellent for your //model.//”
[[Huh?]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="400" name="Listen to Deter’s droning" tags="" position="8634,9399" size="100,100">“In early tests the subjects would often not even notice they were being manipulated.  In one test involving the pheromone serum, a female agent was sent out on a date.  Then, at the end of the night, after their target was well exposed to the altering agents, they would make an unreasonable request of their date - one of these powerful type A personality alpha males would normally readily reject.”

“What did they ask for?” you wonder.

“Unreasonable things.  The man’s wedding ring if he was cheating, the keys to a $300,000 sports car after the first date,  the password to a valuable corporate account… and that was just with an evening of exposure.”

“So I have become one of these “agents”?”  

“No, those agents were born female and merely deployed a test aerosol of a concentrated formula.  You, on the other hand, //produce// PH-99.  Taylor, to be frank with you...I have no idea how //they// did this to you.”

//”They???”//  You mentally dodge that bombshell.  “What else can you tell me about this supposed chemical I produce?”

“It isn’t “supposed,” it is a statement of fact.   However, the pheromone concentration and secondary effect appears weak and diluted at the moment, but I am confident it will increase in potency over time.  Hmm...in addition, one of PH-99’s intended side effects is to produce feeling of normalcy and non-alarm in those that ingest it.”

“Oh cool!  So I am basically like a Jedi!” you conclude.  Everything seems to click into place.  //Cool!  I am a walking mind trick!//

Mr. Deter facepalms.  “No, my dear, are a slut infiltrator, meant to assassinate, sabotage, and steal valuable information and secrets for your corporate and government masters.”

“Okay...assuming all that is true...then how the fuck did I turn into this in the first place?”

Mr. Deter blinks.  “The answer to that question I have not yet ascertained.  But don’t worry, Taylor!  Between the two of us I am certain we will be able to unravel this mystery.”

“I should have just went to the hospital…”

“Oh those morons at the hospital never would have found anything.  Primitive tech, primitive methods, and //extraordinarily// small minds…”

“Uh huh…//anyway...//”

“Hm, I need more data,” he answers after a moment of thought.

“And how do you get more data?”

Mr. Deter rolls his eyes at your question.  “By doing //experiments!//” he replies.

You narrow your eyes at your teacher.  “What kind of experiments?”  As soon as you ask the question, you immediately fear you already know the answer.

“Yes, //human// experiments - the most valuable data.  Rats and mice, no, no, not //good enough for me!//”

Mr. Deter has just admitted to conducting illegal and highly unethical experiments.  //Wait a sec...WHAT THE FUCK?!//  “Who did you use as test subjects!?” you shout at Deter.  You stare daggers at him, demanding answers.

Mr. D. has the decency to look somewhat embarrassed.  “Yes, I experiment on my students,” he informs you as if the admission is as trivial as preferring mustard vs ketchup on a hot dog.

“You fucker! So you// are// responsible for what happened to me!”

“No, no, no...I doubt that is true…”

“You have got to be fucking kidding me!”

“I was using purely benign laboratory reagents.  Most of the tests are harmless and non invasive,” he lamely eplains in an attempt to mollify you. 

“//Most!?//  [[You belong in jail you fuckin’ psycho!]]”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="402" name="Go to your room and sleep" tags="" position="5848,11249" size="100,100">The next day you wake up and enjoy a long shower before heading to school.  As you walk around one of the opulent campus buildings, you spot a trio of thugs accosting Drew.

“Hey it is Fatty McVirgin!” shouts a particularly clever thug, a burly guy you recognize as one of Mitch’s minions.

Drew ignores the jibe.  He puts his head down and keeps walking but the hoodlums soon block his path.

“I am just going to class…” Drew tries to explain.

“Well you will have to go around us then!” the leader says with a laugh.

Drew tries to walk around the trio but they keep shuffling to constantly block your friend’s path.

“Please, just let me by…” Drew requests in a small, frightened, but above all frustrated voice.

//What a bunch of dickheads.  Fucking grown men still bullying people!  Unbelievable!// you rage in amazement.  You suddenly wish you were in the form of a viking warrior instead of a slender young woman.  You briefly imagine savagely leaping into the fray and beating the shit out of the thugs and decapitating them with flashing twin axes.

You storm up to the group.

“What the hell are you guys doing?” you demand of the group.  The trio of goons looks shocked that such an unimposing woman has come to confront them.  You don’t know exactly why, but in that moment you hate the bullies, and you now want nothing more than to compound their confused looks.  “...to my boyfriend?” you finish your previous sentence with an add-on.

The bullies look like a flying pig just sailed across the soccer field in front of them.

“Look at this guys clothes!” says one of the others.  “There is no way he can afford a chick like that.”

“He isn’t paying you a penny!?  Uh huh, he just is //that charming//, eh?” the lead thug mutters skeptically.  “What are some of the things you like about this fat tub of shit anyway?”

The guy’s rudeness pisses you off immensely.  He reminds you far too much of Mitch.

“Well…” you begin to answer but as soon as you begin to speak your anger lights a fire underneath you.  You decide to give these assholes a truth bomb.  “Drew is a great fucking guy!  He is brilliant, and funny, and he is a good man who has a gentle, kind heart.  He outclasses you fuckin’ losers in //every concevable way//...And he has a huge cock and is great in bed,” you conclude.

The tallest thug laughs outright at your display.

“Ew.  Are you his sister or something?” wonders the smallest bully.

“Yeah, there is no way they are going out.  That lame kiss confirms it.  Your sister is pretty cute though, Drew.  We might have to //borrow// her one day for a workout.”

“Ah, sick!  Fuck, let’s get out of here…” the bullies retreat with a look of confused, jealous disgust.  You can’t help but laugh at their retreating backs.

//Still...maybe I went too far,// you think as you look at Drew’s bright red face.  //No, definitely too far! I just kissed a fucking dude!//

“Tayyylorrr,” Drew huffs, exhaling in a one big breath, as if he had stopped breathing since the moment you first kissed him.

“Shut up!  Don’t say anything, I do not want to fucking hear it.  C’mon, Drew, let’s head to class before we are late.”  //And before I burst into flames from embarrassment…I just kissed Drew….Oh fuck, even just thinking that statement makes me feel so  fucking weird!//

[[Head to class with Drew]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="406" name="Head to class with Drew" tags="" position="5851,11554" size="100,100">After classes, you see Drew leaving the Arts buildings and jog up and join him.  You walk beside your portly friend, heading south in the direction where both your homes lie.

Drew looks startled when you join him, as if he was expecting the sudden appearance of bat to the head rather than a cute girl.

“Hey Drew!”

Drew swallows.  “Hi…”  Drew does not seem relieved to see you, in fact the opposite seems true.  As soon as you stand beside your long time friend, you suddenly feel a bit self conscious.  You notice more than a few weird looks from passers by.  //Do we really look like such a mismatched pair?// you wonder as Drew walks along stiffly at your side.

“You need to stick up for yourself more,” you gently chide your friend.

“But!  But!  Y-You kissed me!  On t-the the lips!” Drew makes the statement sound like a horrible accusation.  //From his expression I didn’t think he minded that much...//

“It was just acting, man,” you brush off Drew.  “Remember your birthday and the maid stuff?”  As soon as the words leave your mouth you feel a bit embarrassed.  //Fuck, maybe I shouldn’t have brought// that //up.//
[[Drew’s eyes go wide.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="407" name="Wait for Evan in the lobby" tags="" position="2501,14049" size="100,100">A few minutes later, Evan reappears and waves you into a hallway and then into a side room.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/clinicinside.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Inside is a friendly looking nurse and some basic lab equipment.

You submit to a blood draw along with a saliva and hair sample.  “I will send these to our lab,” the nurse informs you when you are finished.  “We have a bit of a backlog but they should be done in a few days.”

You are surprised at how quick and painless the procedure is.  //Maybe I will finally learn something useful!// you think cheerfully.

A couple minutes later, you are all finished, standing awkwardly outside the clinic with Evan.  You squint up at the sun, still fairly high in the sky.  //It is still early...//
Even gives you a creepy look and wiggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“Uh, what are you doing Evan?”
“You should join me tonight...my place is a lot closer than yours,” Evan offers.
You sigh.  You really want to just go with him and have fun, even though you two are bound to get carried away.  You have given into your urges so many times that it has now become pretty difficult to resist.  Being a girl was just //too// much fun.

[[Go meet Evan in his room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="408" name="You return to the living room with Rhea" tags="" position="2853,10198" size="100,100">Jimmy returns and the rest of your friends make drunken conversation.  You shoot Sam a smile and she shyly smiles back, but you are soon drawn back to Rhea who seems to have stalked you back to the couch.

You notice Rhea progressively moving closer to you.  At first she gently touches your shoulder, then your arm...and then suddenly you find that Rhea is pressed up against you, her delicate hands massaging your own.  The movements are so intimate...they make you deeply uncomfortable.  It feels good but...you’ve never really considered Rhea in a romantic light.  A sexual one, sure...but this...this was something else entirely.

You pull yourself away from Rhea’s clutches, feeling hot and stuffy.  

You have another drink to cool down. Zoning out, you sit back down on the vacant couch.  A few moments later, Rhea appears beside you.

“~Hey Taylor!” Rhea coos softly as she sits down and leans next to you.

You can now hear your own ragged breath.  You had recovered and yet now, a few minutes later, you are right back where you started.

//Why shouldn’t I just go for it?// you can’t help but wonder.  What is really holding you back?  //Who cares if Rhea is easy- she is fucking hot and into me!//

The beautiful Rhea sucks you in, your lips gradually drawn towards each other.  When they meet, it only inspires even greater contact.  Rhea pets your hair as her lips caress your own until you are left squirming in dismay.  As a man you would have had a raging boner...yet now…your arousal takes a new form.

“Mmmm….oh….”  Soon Rhea’s tongue is entwined with your own and you can do nothing but offer a pathetic show of resistance before giving in completely.

Rhea’s tongue and lips roam over your neck, your cheeks, your ears, and your own aching lips until you feeling like you are burning up.  

“Oh...this is too much,” you breathlessly protest.

[[Rhea laughs at you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="409" name="Huh?" tags="" position="8776,9299" size="100,100">“My model?  What //model//?  What the fuck are you talking about?”  You can feel yourself getting angry.  Deter’s seemingly intensional evasiveness annoys the heck out of you.

Mr. Deter sighs.  “Model 7-3-9, that’s you.  The seven series and up are military designations, drawn from older blacklist and prototyping projects I completed for the government in my youth.  Hmmm...to phrase this in a way your feeble brain is capable of comprehending: you are a //spy,// Taylor.  You may be a mere tool, but you are certainly a superb piece of craftsmanship.”

“So I am genderbent fucking James Bond!?  That is the most preposterous thing I have ever fucking heard.  You do the title “mad scientist,” justice.  You are a //quack//.”

Mr.Deter becomes irate.  “Don’t be so high and mighty!&quot; he shouts.  &quot;You are merely something that was meant to gather intelligence and do it in an effective way.  You’re a pleasure model, a slut that is meant to go fuck your way into valuable intelligence and advantageous positions.”

“I don’t believe you,” you say to Deter, yet your own quivering voice gives notice to your lie.

“Maybe I am lying,” Deter concedes, seeming to admit to a level of untruthfulness.  But Mr. Deter also seems like the type that is far too fucking arrogant to lie.

[[Listen to Deter’s droning]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/campus.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You breathe a sigh of relief when you surprisingly manage to arrive a few minutes early for class.  You see your two closest friends, Evan and Drew, standing awkwardly near the door to the lecture hall.&lt;/p&gt;

[[Look at your friends]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="411" name="Let Julie &quot;help&quot; you again" tags="" position="12392,20799" size="100,100">A minute later you are seated in a folding chair in your bathroom as Julie tugs at your long brown hair.  You endure the pain as she works out every knot and tangle in your hair.  You are surprised when you get a moment of respite, as Julie dashes outside before returning.

“Please hurry up, Julie.”

“Okay~  If you insist!”

//Thuck, thuck, thunk-thuck!//  “FUCKING OW! OW OW OW OW OW! WHAT THE FUCK JULIE!?” you scream out in agony as your sister rapid-fucking-fire pierces your ears without your consent.

You clutch at your bleeding ears with and stare at the redness on your fingertips with disbelief.

“What?  Don’t bitch, //bitch,// hehe!  I had these nice studs so I figured, why not?”

“I can’t believe you!  I could have thrown in jail for assault or some crazy shit!  WHY would you do that!?  What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“Yeah, good luck with that.  Call in the authorities, I am sure you will be super down with that when they check your info out.”  //What the hell?  Is Julie threatening me!?//

“Uhh…”  Your sister throws you a white top that just barely leaves your shoulders and midriff bare.  The pants she gives you are no better.  When you put on the tight fitting yoga style pants you feel exposed, like the pants are a second skin and you are baring your features for the world even while fully clothed.

“Fucking hell…”  //I have to get out of here….//  You stumble towards the hallway but your sister’s voice stops you.
“[[We aren’t done yet, Taylor]]!”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="Evan whispers to you." tags="" position="2502,14798" size="100,100">You feel Evan&#39;s hot, ragged breath upon the nape of your neck.  &quot;Oh wow…&quot;  you moan as Evan&#39;s hands begin to massage your breasts, the body wash foaming into a sudsy, slippery cloud.  The bubbles only serve to speed up and amplify the sensations of Evan&#39;s tender caresses.  He thoroughly gropes your body, half molestation, half massage.
&quot;Evan...uh….this is…&quot;
&quot;The greatest thing ever!&quot; Evan finishes your sentence for you.  //Er...not my choice of words...but maybe not too far off the mark.//  You are already well beyond hot and bothered.
To your delight and dismay, Evan just keeps working on you, teasing you until you feel yourself approaching orgasm.  //Uhhnn….so soon?  Why am I becoming so damned pervy!?// you ask yourself.
You look down and see Evan&#39;s cock thrusting between your legs.
&quot;Uh….&quot;  //How did it come to this?//
&quot;If you want me to put it in you are going to have to ask politely,&quot; Evan informs you of his demand.  He continues to hump you, fucking your thighs while working your clit with his right hand, while his left continues to grope and tease you, meandering about your sodden, woefully aroused body.
You bite your lip.  //What an asshole...//
You&#39;re already here alone on vacation with Evan.  You have already had sex and you are no stranger to lewd behaviour.  You&#39;re in the shower with your best friend, in this precarious situation.  //It hardly matters if we have sex...//  It is clear at this point that having sex is obviously something you both want.
&quot;Fine.  Put it in,&quot; you say to Evan.
&quot;Put it in….?&quot; he gleefully repeats the words.
&quot;//Please...// put your dick inside me, Evan.&quot; you rephrase.  When the words leave your mouth they sound even more fucked up than you could have imagined.
[[Have sex with Evan in the shover]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="Have sex with Evan in the shover" tags="" position="2343,14898" size="100,100">//There is no turning back...I guess I might as well just enjoy the weekend and help Evan out in the process...//  You are both perverts, so it is only fair to indulge each other&#39;s fantasies, right?
When you turn back into a man it can&#39;t hurt to have a few more pleasant memories.  
//Pleasant...pleasure….ahhh….//
Your mind snaps back into the present.  You are now overwhelmed with a burning sense of desire.  Your tight, young pussy is aching to be filled.  You need a dick to make you feel good.
And Evan&#39;s cock is right there...just what you need...pressing and sliding across your entrance.
&quot;Put it in!  //Now!//&quot; you command.  Your forcefulness goads Evan forth.
He raises your leg to get better access.  Evan then begins pressing his swollen glans against your opening and you find yourself slowly easing yourself down on him, in a search to quench your smouldering desire.
[[Get penetrated]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="Get penetrated" tags="" position="2499,14948" size="100,100">As the warm water falls around you, you are again deeply penetrated by your best friend.
&quot;Uhhhhhhhnnnnnnnn~ hnngghh…&quot; you moan loudly as Evan fills your tight pussy to capacity.  The foreign feeling of having something inside you makes you shiver as Evan spreads you apart.
You feel yourself stretch to accommodate your friend&#39;s girth, your internal muscles moulding into Evan&#39;s phallic shape.
//Wow!  Fuck!  This is happening again!  I am having sex as a girl...with Evan….and it feels sooo good!  Fuck me!//
&quot;Fuck me!&quot; you repeat your thoughts aloud.
Evan laughs.  &quot;With pleasure, Taylor!&quot;
Evan begins to joyously pound away at your pussy until you are left trembling and weak in the knees.  Evan gives your ass a few playful slaps.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evantayshower.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

With every thrust you go just a little bit more insane until you find yourself bracing yourself against the shower&#39;s wall while throwing your backside at Evan to meet his battering-ram thrusts.
You cannot believe how good it feels to be fucked in such a carefree manner.
Soon the small water tank is nearly empty and the water starts to run cold.  As the water cools you feel your own body temperature go in the opposite direction.  Evan&#39;s pounding has you panting, wet, and hot.
Evan reaches his limit with a groan and gives you a dozen full length thrusts before he goes balls deep inside you and his pulsing cock ejaculates until completion, filling your pussy with your best friend&#39;s semen.
Evan rests inside you, half heartedly thrusting in you until his member finally shrinks and he withdraws.
[[Finish the shower]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="415" name="Finish the shower" tags="" position="2349,15043" size="100,100">&quot;You&#39;re the sexiest chick alive,&quot; Evan compliments you. &quot;That was fucking awesome!&quot; 
You watch Evan&#39;s cum drip out of you and slowly get flushed down the shower&#39;s drain.
&quot;Yeah it was…&quot; you breathlessly admit.
Suddenly Evan spins you around and lays his lips down upon yours, kissing you with an intensity that shocks and frightens you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/kiss.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900px&quot; height=&quot;675px&quot;&gt;
The kiss surprises you and makes you far more uncomfortable than the sex had for some reason.
The water becomes ice cold as Evan&#39;s lips and tongue explore your own.  After what seems like an eternity, he steps out of the shower and begins toweling off, leaving you standing stunned in the now freezing water.  
You step out of the shower.  Despite the long time under the water, you can still see white traces of Evan&#39;s efforts surrounding the entrance to your pussy.  A hand that still looks far too frail to be your own is drawn to your lips.  //Why the fuck did he have to do that?//  Having sex with Evan was bad enough, but kissing?  You aren&#39;t sure what to think anymore, but one thing is clear: you feel kissing to be a step in the wrong direction.  You and Evan are just borrowing each other&#39;s company to satisfy some youthful urges.  It isn&#39;t like you have ever actually had a single romantic thought involving Evan.  If you let him keep kissing you, Evan is sure to get the wrong idea.
You slip on a fresh pair of panties, some shorts, and a T-shirt.  Evan oggles your visible breasts as you step out of the bathroom.   You roll your eyes at him.

[[Make dinner with Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="416" name="Make dinner with Evan" tags="" position="2503,15104" size="100,100">Evan wanders over to the fridge and coolers and begins to unpack some food items.  As he begins to cook, you decide join him in the kitchen.  You suddenly find that you are //ravenous//.

As the food simmers on the stove, Evan moves forward and begins to fondle your breasts.  You hear Evan take a deep, clearly audible sniff from the top of your head.

&quot;Ew.  What the hell?&quot;
&quot;You just smell //really// fucking good.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say about that.&quot;
&quot;I could just do this all day,&quot; he tells you, while deeply inhaling your scent.  Evan keeps cupping your breasts, rolling his thumb and pointer over your nipples until they are rock are hard and you feel like you are overheating.  &quot;Seriously I just wish I could like bottle up your fragrance it drives me wild.  What kind of perfume do you wear?&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t wear fucking perfume!&quot;
&quot;Well you should get in the business!&quot;
&quot;Evan…&quot; you try and restrain Evan a bit.
&quot;Oh Taylor don&#39;t be like that.  Imagine you transform back into a man tomorrow, think of all the regrets you would have!  At the very least, I think you would probably like some pervy memories.&quot;
&quot;Ugh...maybe.  But why would I want to share...err… //make// them with you?&quot;
&quot;Because we are friends.  We are both cool and horny...and wouldn&#39;t you know it?  We appear to be on a sexy mountain retreat with nothing to do-except each other!&quot;
You sigh.  You have been defeated by Evan&#39;s persistence and idiocy too many times.
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get the most out of this weekend!  Let&#39;s eat, get our strength up, and then get back to...//what&#39;s important.//&quot;  As if to add impetus to his statement, Evan pops the caps off two bottles of beer.

[[Eat with Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="417" name="Eat with Evan" tags="" position="2347,15198" size="100,100">&quot;Cheers!  To our weekend of awesomeness that is //so// much better without Drew.&quot;
&quot;Cheers,&quot; you say as you clink bottles.  The reminder of Drew&#39;s absence makes you sad.  It looks like your little tradition died last year.  //But it isn&#39;t so bad,// you think as you look at Evan&#39;s smiling face.  It was the way of the world: old traditions die and new ones are established in their place.

You and Evan finish cooking.  Evan makes several stupid jokes and you do your best to ignore his foolishness.  You eat a tasty and enjoyable dinner together and start to clean up once you are finished.

As you set the dishes to dry in a rack, you notice a nearby box.  You open it and find it is filled with Monopoly and a few board games.  &quot;Hey remember when we had to play with these?&quot; you say with a laugh.  The last few years even internet and video games made their way out into the cabin&#39;s nature and the boardgames had fallen away into childish nostalgia.  You are fairly certain you can now even get a strong cell signal out here in the middle of nowhere.
&quot;Want to play Monopoly?&quot; you ask Evan.
Evan gives you a disparaging look.  He firmly grabs the box out of your your hands and sets it down.  
&quot;I have a better idea.  Trust me, it is a lot more fun...it&#39;s a really cool //two player game.//&quot;
You bite your lip.  &quot;That does sound kind of fun...&quot;

[[Head to the bedroom with Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="418" name="Head to the bedroom with Evan" tags="" position="2499,15256" size="100,100">With little coaxing, you and Evan head to the cabin&#39;s main bedroom.  You let Evan push you down and you lie down on your back.  Evan strips down and gently spreads your legs and climbs on top of you.
Evan tries to kiss you but you turn your face away.
&quot;No kissing,&quot; you inform Evan.  He looks momentarily saddened but is soon distracted by your naughtier, accessible bits.
Evan begins to suck and tease your nipples.
&quot;Oh that feels….so good...Uhhh!&quot;
You and Evan proceed to have a marathon sex session that makes your first night at Evan&#39;s look like a warm up.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evantay.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;  Evan fucks you in a variety of positions, finally settling on mounting you from behind, doggy style.  As Evan mates with you like a stallion, you can&#39;t help but cum on your friend&#39;s cock.  Your shaking butt and convulsing love canal flood with your juices, which only serve to lubricate and speed Evan&#39;s thrusts.  You suddenly become glad you aren&#39;t facing Evan as you shiver and orgasm while your old friend&#39;s big dick invades your intimate insides.
&quot;Uh, uh, uh, uh….&quot;
//Fap.  Fap.  Fap…..//  The sounds and smells of your sex pervade the room.  As you cum a third time, you feel yourself falling down a rabbit hole, like poor Alice lost to Wonderland.
&quot;Oh my god…&quot;  //What is wrong with us?  Maybe a lot or maybe nothing at all...//  You ask and answer your own question.
Evan&#39;s cock kisses your womb, and you feel both your vagina and Evan&#39;s manhood grip and convulse together as you are both pushed over the edge into a white beckoning cloud of pleasure.
Evan eats an apple and drinks a glass of orange juice and is back fucking you within minutes.  After a long, exhausting sex session, Evan cums inside you twice more and falls asleep with his soft shaft still buried inside you.

[[Fall asleep next to Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="419" name="Fall asleep next to Evan" tags="" position="2351,15347" size="100,100">You wake up the next morning feeling a tad groggy.  You find your positions have shifted in the night, Evan is now spooning you, his morning wood pressing into your butt cheek.

//Fuck, this guy is incorrigible.  Evan is a walking erection.//
&quot;He is a literal homo-erectus!&quot; you snigger.  You are beginning to have some serious doubts about your relationship with Evan.  Are you indeed helping to satisfy each other&#39;s urges...or are you in fact just making them worse?

Before Evan can use you to take care of his morning wood, you ghost out of bed and start to make breakfast.

You start frying some bacon and the smell soon draws Evan from the bedroom.  He comes up behind you and gives you a groping hug.  //Uh...//  Evan’s constant groping and over familiarity makes you comfortable.  You note he is definitely treating you more like a //girl//friend rather than a plain friend.

After breakfast, the two of you head outside and spend some time by the lake.  You sit down on the dock and lose yourself in the lake’s mirror like surface.

Evan startles you when he appears behind you.  He has a backpack in hand and a grin on his face.

“Perfect day for a hike!” he opines.  “What do you say?”

[[Go hiking with Evan]]
[[Suggest fishing instead]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="420" name="Bang Mitch" tags="" position="13149,18246" size="100,100">Seconds later Mitch is inside you.

“Oh yeah, you love my fucking dick!” Mitch yells in your ear as he rails you.  He slaps your ass for good measure, the slap and sound of your sex echoes throughout the room.

His words sting far more than the slap.  Probably because they were true...but you would never admit such a thing aloud without coercion.  You love the feeling of Mitch’s cock penetrating your tingling body.

You are already on a plateau, a new undiscovered height of pleasure….and now you are having sex upon that mountain peak as well.  Drugs feel good.  Sex feels good.  Together...well let’s just say you find the experience to be “more than the sum of its parts.”

“Uh, uh...uh…” you can’t help but moan as Mitch pounds you.  Your tight little pussy takes his cock like a champ.  Soon your toes are curling while your hands atr grabbing tightly at the bed sheets.

“Ohhhhhhhhh!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchpounded.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mitch’s huge cock penetrates you completely then withdraws, continuing to piston within your wet hole until you are howling with pleasure.  You feel like you are being completely broken and enjoying the deconstruction.  Your mind, its very pleasure centers, are being rewritten and you are loving every moment of the demolition and reconstruction.

[[You fear you will never be the same again]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="421" name="Agree to have coffee with Mitch" tags="" position="3538,3940" size="100,100">You are sitting across from Mitch at a coffee shop off campus.  //This is super fucking weird, not only am I sitting with Mitch but there is almost a weird ass quasi-date atmosphere here!  What the fuck?  I wonder what the hell was going through my mind when I agreed to this...?//

You take a deep breath before you speak, attempting to not browbeat or anger Mitch unnecessarily….well, as much as possible.

&quot;So, what?  You&#39;re a big homo now, Mitch?&quot; you ask your longtime bully.

&quot;Huh? Haha….no...&quot; Mitch stammers.  You follow his gaze downward to your chest.  &quot;No, Taylor, I don&#39;t think I am gay,&quot; he continues.  After you cross your arms over your breasts and angrily thumb upwards a few times, Mitch finally looks up and you are suddenly struck by a detail you note.  Mitch is //blushing// at you.

Wow.  What the fuck is happening to you?  //I feel like I am in some sort of alternate dimension or something!//

&quot;I am kind of amazed I have to explain this to you, Mitch.  I am a guy - and you&#39;re a fucking asshole who is also a guy.  Pretty cut and dry there.  I don&#39;t know what you want or expect from me but I am straight.  I like girls.&quot;

As your last three words leave your mouth you suddenly notice a lot of people looking at you and Mitch.  A guy is laughing in your general direction and nearly spills his coffee.

&quot;So do I.&quot;

&quot;Okay, so that&#39;s solved then.  Can you leave me alone now?&quot;

Mitch&#39;s face falls.  He looks genuinely disappointed.  &quot;What?  C&#39;mon.  Just hang out with me for a bit….we just got here, //please//. I want to spend some more time with you.  You haven&#39;t even finished your coffee,&quot; he observes with a glance at your full, steaming cup.

[[Drink the damn coffee]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="422" name="Drink the damn coffee" tags="" position="3698,4037" size="100,100">Mitch&#39;s exceptionally unusual politeness weirds you out immensely...but not as much as the rest of the situation.  //I got turned into a fucking girl and now I am on a coffee date with Mitch.  What the frick has happened to me?  My priorities might be JUST A BIT mixed up,// you mentally concede.

You sigh, looking down at the cup of coffee.  You did agree with to this.  //Just drink the damned coffee and leave!// you order yourself.

&quot;So…&quot; you awkwardly throw the single word out across the table.

Mitch seems to be pretty embarrassed; far  more nervous than you have ever seen the guy.  &quot;I am sorry I treated you the way I have, Taylor,&quot; he apologizes.

&quot;Uh huh…&quot;  Mitch sounds surprisingly sincere but you judge the chance of the statement actually being true is near zero.  But who knows, maybe even demons have a kind, sensitive side.

&quot;I only really picked on you because you are fiesty.  You always react and cuss...I think, in truth, I just like the attention.&quot;

The somewhat sober and practical assessment makes you raise an eyebrow.

&quot;Have you been seeing a shrink?&quot; you tease Mitch.

[[Finish your coffee]]

“Understand what?”

“I wanted to explain why I was such a dick to you all those times. It’s my fault but I’m not a bad guy.”

The years Mitch has picked on you stand as evidence directly contradicting his claim. “Why are you telling me this?”

The bully swallows before answering. “Because I want you to like me.”

“You’ve got to be kidding me! I hate you.”

“Guh…” Mitch slumps over as if you just threw a shot put into his chest. Your words seem to genuinely hurt him. You //almost// feel bad.

After a moment to recover and gather his courage, Mitch sits up. “I don&#39;t blame you. I’m sorry. I’m a piece of shit, okay? I’ll do anything I can do to make it up. Anything you want. Just tell me.”

You are astounded at Mitch’s transformation. You cross your arms over your breasts. Clearly, those things are influencing Mitch’s judgement.  “Why the sudden change of heart?” you ask, latching onto your coffee cup, ready to throw it at Mitch’s face depending on his answer.

“Because you’re the hottest girl I’ve ever seen and I wanted you from the first second I saw you.”

You balk. “I’m not a fucking girl!” Your words ring out above the din of the coffee shop, drawing the attention of nearly everyone in the room.

You cringe under a haze of embarrassment. [[The only consolation is that Mitch seems to be sharing your discomfort.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="424" name="Clean your room" tags="" position="5998,11945" size="100,100">You spend some time cleaning up your messy room and some of the assorted clutter that seems to have accumulated while you were preoccupied.

As you change your sheets, struggling with the now too heavy mattress, you discover an old porn magazine you had stashed a year earlier.  A nostalgic sense of curiosity seizes you and you start leafing through the old magazine.  After a few pages you already begin to feel warm and painfully aroused.  This magazine had always been one of your favourites.  You can’t even begin to estimate how many times over the years you have fapped to it, and such occasions were not just during power or internet outages.

//Hmm...I should probably rub one out for old time’s sake.//
[[Masturbate to the old porno]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="425" name="Masturbate to the old porno" tags="" position="6145,11999" size="100,100">You strip down to your underwear and lie down on your bed.  You open the mag to one of your favourite pages and lose yourself in the blonde pornstar’s actions as she takes a huge cock inside her and then eagerly accepts a facial.  It is just paper but the images are more than animated within your mind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempovporn.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As you fantasize, your hand gradually begins to stroke yourself.  A few minutes of alternating soft and heaving petting soon makes you cum.  Your hand and sex are slick with your love juice.

“Ahhh… That was great!”

Yet, despite your orgasm, you are unsatisfied. If anything, you are only more aroused.
[[Find something more arousing on your computer]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="426" name="Find something more arousing on your computer" tags="" position="5999,12096" size="100,100">You climb off the bed and head to your computer.  You click on your porn folder, cleverly named “Old School Documents,” to deflect prying eyes.  Your 5 gigs of pictures and gifs is quite amateurish compared to Drew’s hoard.

You stop scrolling at a super hot cumshot pic.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/facial4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh y-y-yeah…” you moan as you furiously play with yourself.  You feel yourself getting closer to the precipice of pleasure as you look into the eyes of the cum-covered woman on screen.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taymastf.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[Suddenly you stop.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="427" name="Suddenly you stop." tags="" position="6144,12145" size="100,100">You are again uncomfortably reminded of Drew’s fetish.  //Ugh….almost as bad as thinking about my parents during...eww...//  You know something feels //off//, yet you keep staring at the semen covered woman.  Her blissful expression makes your cross your legs uncomfortably.  You remember fapping to this particular picture at least two dozen times.  Yet now, as a woman, you don’t quite get the same feeling of satisfaction or arousal from pleasuring yourself to it.  As soon as you start stroking yourself to the picture, it just feels //wrong.//  Suddenly you realize what your issue is.  Your perspective keeps shifting, alternating between you having your cock sucked and you being on your knees doing the sucking.  You can no longer tell whether you desire to be the man covering a beautiful woman’s face, or to be that woman receiving a man’s seed.

“What the fuck?”  //I am fucking not imagining sucking a dick!  I am guy,// you mentally scold yourself.  Yet truthfully, you know that isn’t entirely true.  You look down at your breasts.  You are at most only half a man at the moment...and your new body seems content to burn up no matter what type of image you place if front of it or which perspective you take.

You flip through a few more pictures.  You look at another picture of a grinning cum covered woman.  //Fuck, she looks so happy too.  Even if it is an act...I guess it is still kinda hot...//

You pleasure yourself until you feel an orgasm approaching, with that in mind, in your final instant before cumming, your horny thoughts direct you to:

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="428" name="Imagine yourself coating a beautiful face with your semen" tags="" position="6008,12311" size="100,100">Of course you follow your instincts. In your moment of ecstasy, you are momentarily teleported back in time.

In your imagination you have your old body. Cock in hand, you stroke yourself to completion. 

“Ahhh! Yeah, take it all over your face! Uhh….” You flop around as you orgasm, managing to click on a hot video just in time.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/cutefacial.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Fwaahhh… Damn… I miss my dick... “ 

You have a long, cold shower to cool off and then pass out on top of your bed.

The next day&#39;s classes seem to crawl along.  After much doodling, you are finally free.  You briefly go home and drop off your bag and eat a light meal.

You then go and meet Drew before the concert begins.

A huge cock shoots a big load of thick creamy cum onto your face.  You find yourself sticking out your tongue to receive the imaginary semen as you tip the pleasure dominoes over and begin a chain reaction of orgasmic pleasure.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/facial3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Holy fuck that was weird!// you think as you bask in the sweaty afterglow of a shockingly intense orgasm.  “Did that just really happen?  Did I…?”  //What the hell is wrong with me?// you wonder.

You look at your love juice covered hand.  “Fuck...good thing this is just a fantasy...I am already messy enough as it is…”

As you ascend up into the mountains with your friend, you note it feels good to stretch your legs.  You find the fresh mountain air and incredible view to be invigorating.  It takes you two hours to hike the ridge line.  Eventually you find yourself on a plateau and you two take a break.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hike.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

When you reach the summit, you feel like a conqueror.  //I did it!// you exult.  It was definitely more difficult than it would have been as a man, but in truth the extra challenge had been more enjoyable than you might have once guessed.  Some pleasures transcend sex and gender- and the touring the mountains was clearly one of them.  You look over at Evan and smile.  You are suddenly glad that you came on this trip.  You feel //happy.//  
“So I might as well enjoy it!”
“Hmm?  What are you talking about?”
“Nothing!  Let’s go hike down to the other side and see if we can make it down to that hidden lake your dad is always talking about.”
“That’s a good idea!” Evan agrees.  He takes a bite of a granola bar.  He sees you watching him with interest and breaks you off about a quarter of the bar.
“You’re so generous!” you mock him.
“What?  We brought extra, get your own!  Besides you are smaller now so you don’t need to eat as much of this as I do.”
You shake your head at Evan and begin almost skipping down the westward trail, your energy seemingly renewed.

[[Continue hiking with Evan]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="431" name="Suggest fishing instead" tags="" position="2209,15449" size="100,100">“I would rather not get eaten by a bear if at all possible!” you joke.  “It is such a nice day, too… Look at how calm the lake is,” you observe, pointing out at the still water.  “Oh!  Let’s go fishing!”

“Ugh…”  Evan looks like you just punched him in the gut.

“What, you don’t like fishing?”

“You know I don’t!  Fuckin’ fish.” 

You roll your eyes.  “Who doesn’t like fish?”

“Well I don’t mind eating one on a rare occasion but I don’t want to touch a living, slimey one.  That’s gross.”

“You sound like a fucking girl.  We should trade places.”

“Hah, you give me the magic serum or whatever and I will consider it.”

“I wish it was that easy…”  //But I came out here to forget about all this bullshit for a little bit...//  “I just want to do something relaxing,” you insist.

Evan’s face falls.  “Relaxing?  Aww… I was kind of hoping we could, you know… maybe...” Evan eyes you suggestively. 

“You’re such a creep!”

“I am sorry I can’t help it…”  Evan’s disappointment is palpable.

You scowl at your friend but he just smiles dopily back at you.  You just want to fish and not be conscious of your changes for a day but Evan appears to have something else in mind.  It seems likely that no matter what you do, Evan will undoubtedly try something //perverted.//

“Uhh….  Hey, Evan...”  You //really// want to go fishing but this is Evan’s vacation too.  He has helped you out a lot lately and drove you all the way out here.  Not to mention the Moore family owns the cabin and has let you freeload off them for over a decade.

[[“Let’s actually try fishing!  I want to feast tonight!”]]
[[“Let’s push the canoe out!”]]
[[“Let’s just take it easy and cast off the dock for now…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="432" name="Continue hiking with Evan" tags="" position="2648,15546" size="100,100">Eventually you pause on a flat plateau overlooking a sea of emerald lakes and shivering pine trees.  
“Hey, Taylor…” Evan whispers as he creeps up close to you.  “Ever had sex on top of a mountain?” he asks you.
“No, of course not…”  His perverted question causes a strange twinge inside your pussy.
“Well, do you want to?  I have been meaning to cross this one off my bucket list,” Evan presses you.
You look at Evan’s boner straining against his pants and sigh.
A part of you wants to slap Evan for his boldness, but a more dominant section of your mind is curious about how thrilling it would be to get fucked on the top of the world.
“C’mon, I will be quick!” Evan insists.
“I am sure you will,” you reply dryly as you slide down your shorts and underwear and present your bare ass and pussy for your friend.  Evan has his pants down and dick inside you a millisecond later.  Evan proceeds to fuck you hard from behind while you struggle to brace yourself on a nearby tree and remain afoot.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evantayhike.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Evan begins to moan as his pace intensifies, his huge cock thrusting in and out of you at a blistering rate.  True to his word, Evan cums inside you in no time flat.
//Great now I get to hike around all day with Evan’s cum inside me...//
As Evan exults over his orgasm, his softening shaft still half heartedly thrusting inside you, he leans forward and kisses the top of your head, inhaling your scent.
//Ugh… I really need to have a talk with Evan and set down some boundaries and ground rules.//
But you decide now is not the time for that.  It is a beautiful day and it is time to //hike!//  You’re on vacation and vacations are meant to be fun!
[[Hike west]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="433" name="Hike west" tags="" position="2512,15591" size="100,100">Another hour of hard hiking later you are less enthusiastic and energetic.  Your little legs have been forced to make a lot of extra steps.  Each stride you make comes minutely slower than the last.  //Ughh..I am going to be sore tomorrow!//  You then blush with embarrassment as you imagine a few more ways you might wake up with a few aches and pains in the morning.

You and Evan follow the trail into a dense forest.  The constant steep incline, either up or down, seems to drain your energy.  Soon your calves are burning and you are about to request a break, when you suddenly turn a corner and [[come face to face with the stuff of nightmares.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="434" name="Run" tags="" position="2825,15775" size="100,100">
As you and the bear lock eyes you suddenly become even more terrified and quite certain the bear means to devour you.  Your fight or flight instincts kick and the choice is obvious: you run, bursting forth through the underbrush like a bat unleashed from hell.

The last thing you see before making your escape is Evan’s confused expression as the bear ignores him and charges after you.  You bolt into the woods, vaulting over a fallen tree and then running as fast as your slender legs will carry you.

You immediately regret your decision when it becomes apparent after about ten seconds that the bear is probably at least four times as fast as you are.  You don’t even want to consider the difference in mass or muscle strength.
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!” you howl as you run through the woods, branches and foliage slapping and clawing at your face and clothes until you are torn and bloody.
Ahead, you see a possible prospect of salvation.  A gnarly tree with good footholds looks like something you can maybe use to put some distance between you and your pursuer.
[[Climb the tree]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="435" name="Let Evan take the lead" tags="" position="2752,15892" size="100,100">Evan has spent a lot more time in the mountains than you have.  Because of this, you decide to let Evan take the lead.  Yet your friend isn’t exactly what you would call a “woodsman.”  You silently pray you have made the right choice, you are gambling with your life after all.  You decide that you will just have to trust your friend.

You bend your knees, ready to dash away at a moment’s notice.

[[Wait for Evan to deal with the bear]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="436" name="Play dead" tags="" position="2546,15892" size="100,100">You fall to the ground and do your best dead duck impression.  Evan watches you fall with disbelief.  You were fairly certain Evan would imitate your choice but instead he appears to vehemently disagree with your choice.  You can clearly see him mouthing angry words at you.  You can vaguely make out some of them: the words, “No,” along with “What the fuck are you doing?”
You have a really bad feeling about this.  Now you are prone and can’t even run away properly.  //Oh fuck...//  You //really// regret your decision.
[[Wait for Evan to deal with the bear]]

Your relative happiness lasts only a second, for the black bear, despite it’s huge mass and ungainly form, begins to climb expertly up the tree.
//What the fuck!?  Oh no!//
You try and climb higher but end up slipping.
You feel a pinch of pain in your ankle and calf as you are pulled down, kicking and screaming onto the forest ground.
You are suddenly thrown forward.  You roll away into the underbrush.  You feel no pain as you look down in horror at the deep claw marks gouging into your flesh.  You’re bleeding everywhere, your hands, even the leaves and ground feels warm and wet.

The bear towers over you and you raise a shaking arm to ward him off.  It looks almost funny in a way.  A child’s arm against the brute strength of one of the fiercest beasts in the world.

You watch the bear’s massive paws descend on you, slapping your feeble resistance away as if it wasn’t even there.  The bear attacks you and you feel like a boxer receiving the beating...//mauling// of your life.

You try and fight back and scream but resistance is futile.  The bear’s maw appears over your face.  You are terrified but the moment is just that, a moment over and done with in a flash.  The bear’s maw closes around your neck.  You feel intense pressure and hear a sickening popping and gurgling sound and then all your pain fades away into withering blackness.  The last thing you hear is Evan’s anguished call, “TAAYLOR!!  Where are you!?!?”

You are dead.  Don’t run from bears and always carry bear spray.  Remember that black bears are excellent climbers but are usually not aggressive unless starving or provoked.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="439" name="Wait for Evan to deal with the bear" tags="" position="2649,16090" size="100,100">Evan begins to slowly wave his hand at you, motioning you back.  You take the hint to slowly withdraw but, just as you start to edge away, the bear’s eyes lock on to you.  The bear takes a tentative step towards you.

//Oh fuck!  I knew I looked too delicious like this!//

You feel your sense of panic growing.  The bear seems to grow in size until it is enormous and absolutely terrifying.  Just as your fear is about to get the best of you, Evan suddenly breaks his silence.  He steps forward - towards the fucking bear - and begins to //roar// at the giant black creature.

You and the bear are probably equally stunned.

As the sound of Evan’s roar fades, Evan puffs out his chest and begins shaking and waving his arms.  With another deep breath, Evan lets loose a second blood-curdling howl that echoes throughout the forest.  Flocks of random birds burst forth and flee into the sky.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/blackbearsurprise.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The bear decides that you are too fierce to challenge.  With shocking speed it bounds away, disappearing into the mass of trees until it is gone from sight, swallowed in the green canopy.

[[Recover from your ordeal]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="440" name="Recover from your ordeal" tags="" position="2795,16142" size="100,100">Your heart is still beating fratnitcally.  Your legs are shaking from the adrenaline.  For a second you thought you were going to die.  Yet here you are alive.  You wonder if this is how a skydiver feels after walking away after surviving a huge jump.  You have to admit the adrenaline rush feels good.  

You look at Evan and he smiles back at you, as if nothing is amiss.  

//Holy fuck!  That was so brave...and fucking stupid!  I guess that is typical Evan...//

“Are you okay?” Evan asks you.

You find your stomach is still doing somersaults.  You nod at Evan.

“Let’s head back to camp, give that bear some space,” Evan suggests.

“That was...kind of amazing,” you admit to Evan.  You look up at your friend.  You find yourself studying his features as you walk.  

“We did the right thing.  We should have been making more noise too.  The worst part about it is I have bear spray too, just couldn’t find it this morning.”

You shake your head and snap out of it when Evan catches you staring.  You always knew Evan was an interesting guy...yet your interest now seems to go a little bit deeper.  After Evan’s brave display in the forest, you can’t help but look at your friend in a slightly new light.

[[Head back to camp]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="441" name="Head back to camp" tags="" position="2647,16248" size="100,100">As you approach the cabin alone with Evan you begin to feel a level of anxiety that was not present a few hours earlier.  As soon as you are through the door, Evan begins groping you.  He starts to kiss your chest and then gradually leaves a blooming red trail as he slowly works his way between your legs.  Evan keeps kissing and biting at your stomach until you are warm and wet.

“I want to eat you so bad,” he informs you.

“Hah!  Go ahead.  Get a taste of your own bad medicine.  You remember what we did on our hike, right?”

Evan’s face falls.  “Oh.  //Ew.//”  

“Yeah.  //Ew// is right.  I am going to have a shower.”

“Sure!  I will be right there!”
“//Alone!//”

“Awww, why?  Think of the cost and time savings!”

“Yeah, I am sure your motivation for joining me in the shower is part of an environmental crusade.”

“But we--”

“Evan, I want to get //clean// and you are.. Just //dirty// sometimes.  Let me clean up, then you can go, //and then// I will let you eat my pussy because I am a nice...giii---uuuy…”  //What the hell am I saying?  Or thinking?  Evan just fucks with my find.

“You’re right.  Thanks for helping me out. Taylor, you’re such a good friend!”

“Believe me, I know.”

“You’re always looking out for me,” he says.  You see what you think are tears of gratitude welling in Drew’s eyes. 

“Hey, we are friends so don’t mention it!”

Drew nods eagerly.  “Do you…” Drew starts a sentence but finishes short.

“Hmm?”

“Do you want to, uh, maybe, come over and play some AA?”

“Um…”  You briefly mull over your thoughts.  The awkward incidents with Drew keep mounting, so it is probably best to give him a bit of space, at least for now.  Still, the allure of a genuine, non shit triple A title is hard for a seasoned gamer like yourself to resist.

That game is just too sweet and you are still broke and bored.  Your mysterious sex-change quest will just have to wait until the hordes of evil virtual monsters are all slain.

Despite the nervous tension and weird near-constant glances Drew shoots in your direction, you end up having a great time.  You level up your lightning until it becomes //mega-ice// lightning...then nothing can stand before your virtual might.

Drew’s design is pretty badass too, but he focuses on stats and efficiency at the expense of awesome looking special effects.  You can only shake your head in disbelief at his irrational choices.

Eventually you freak out when you notice how late it is.  //Another day lost to gaming….fuck...//

You bid Drew goodbye and speed walk back to your own house where you soon fall into a fitful sleep, dreaming of a blizzard of mega-ice lightning destroying all your foes.  Mitch explodes into a cloud of bloody ice chips and you fall asleep with a smile on your face.

Punctuality was never your thing, but it was Drew’s and you wanted to talk to him about a few nerdy ideas you had to optimize his character’s spells in AA.

You notice Drew standing alone near a pine tree.  His back is facing you and you creep up behind him.  As you approach, you can hear him muttering.

“I just have to say it and be blunt.  I just got--to look at--her and say: “I have these concert tickets and I got them to say thank you.”  Drew takes a deep breath.  “And we should go together!”

“Sounds pretty good to me,” you say to Drew.

“T-Taylor!?” Drew spins around.  His eyes bulge and he looks absolutely terrified.  //Oh come on man compared to some of the gross shit I caught you doing this is nothing!//

As Drew’s mouth hangs agape, you grab one of the tickets from his hand.

“Whoa!  //Scarface Rocket Zombies!//”  //Best named band ever!// you think with excitement.  “I will //definitely// go with you.  Fuck yeah, some good music is just what I need.”

Drew seems to have recovered somewhat.  He is surprised by your eagerness.

“Thanks, Drew!  You’re awesome!”

You talk about nerdy things for a few minutes before you are forced to split and go your separate ways.  

“Thanks again for the ticket!  I will text you later!”

[[Head to class and daydream]]

SRZ was one of your top five favorite bands and now you would get to see them live!  Drew was such a thoughtful guy.

You google some more details about the concert when you get home later that afternoon.

“Whhhaaat!?”  You are absolutely floored when you see the price tag.  The concert has long since been sold out, and you see a bunch of ads placed by opportunistic assholes trying to scalp the tickets for a fucking grand each.

“I //really// hope Drew didn’t pay that much…”  Still, you suspect your ticket is like a nugget of gold.

It is true you do look out for Drew, but that sentiment luckily appears mutual.

You feel a bit guilty about even accepting such a valuable gift.  You didn’t spend a dime on Drew’s birthday.

“Hmm…”  Still, you think maybe the concert would be good for both of you.  You both like the band and are sort of stressed out shut-ins...the concert seems like the perfect opportunity to come out of your shells...at least for a bit.

You text Drew that you are excited about the concert tomorrow. “Lookin forward 2 it!”

“Me too!” Drew texts back immediately.

You glance around your cluttered room and sigh.  It takes you a moment but you eventually work up the willpower and start to clean up.

[[Clean your room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="447" name="Have a candid drunk chat with Drew" tags="" position="6742,14209" size="100,100">Your topics of conversation meander all over the place, finally landing on...girls.

“You have got to have some kind of interests in the opposite sex.  What kind of girls do you like?” you ask Drew.

Drew stares at you for about thirty seconds before shaking his head.  “I-I don’t know…”

“C’mon Drew.  Describe your dream girl for me!”

“Uhh….I-I really don’t think I can do that.”

You laugh.  “Why not?  Try!”

Drew stutters incoherently for a moment.

“Well, would you prefer a big gal or a small one?” you wonder.
Drew looks you up and down.  “Pet-petite!” he answers, his words coming out in a split stutter.

“Okay.  Petite with a nice rack, eh?”

Drew nods.

“Hmm… And I bet you want a smart chick too, right?&quot;
Drew eagerly nods.

&quot;Yeah not sure where you will find a girl like that...” you trail off.

“I can’t do this anymore!&quot; Drew suddenly explodes.  &quot;It’s //you!//  Of course it is you!  It has always been you, Taylor!”

“Huh?  What are you trying to say?  That you...//like//… me?”

“I just described //you,// Taylor.  You’re my dream girl.  I love nearly everything about you.”

“W-----hat!?”  //Whoa!// Drew’s honesty shatters your composure completely.  Your brain ceases to function for about thirty seconds while your mind processes what Drew has just admitted to you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="448" name="Respond to Drew" tags="" position="6882,14254" size="100,100">Drew’s confession leaves you feeling unbelievably torn.  His words make you simultaneously happy and very sad.  You want to smile and weep at the same time.  Drew is an undeniably sweet guy.  He is just sad and lonely.
//He doesn’t have to be lonely, though...I am here after all...//  Which is precisely your current problem.

You stare at Drew.  He looks embarrassed, a bit pathetic...and maybe a bit //cute// too.  After everything Drew has done for you today, you figure he deserves at least a peck on the cheek.  You don’t have any money, but you do have a gorgeous body your friend seems to appreciate.
You slide toward Drew on the couch, and slowly move your lips towards Drew’s cheek.  Just as your lips are about to touch Drew, his face turns towards yours at the last instant.  Your “kiss on the cheek” misses and lands square upon Drew’s lips.

“Mmmphh!”

//Fuck...oops.//

You and Drew appear equally shocked at what just happened.  The moment seems to draw on as you two stare at each other, lips pressed together.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/kissdrew.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
//No!  I am kissing Drew...again...//  Yet this time is far more intimate than your display in front of Drew’s bullies.

Your tickets include a seat, but fuck that- you want to get up close on the floor where the real action is.  //Hmm...Apparently so do all these other people.//

“I have been looking forward to this,” Drew admits.

“Me too.”

“I don’t get out that much…”

“Neither do I.  At least now you get to go to a sweet concert with a hot chick!”

“Y-yeah…”

“Oh come on!  Imagine if Evan were in your place!”

Drew’s eyes go wide.

“Yep.  He would be doing fucking backflips.  So just smile, relax, and try and have some fun.  I know I will!”

You are soon inside the venue.  You browse some merchandise stands and find your seats while the opening bands play.  They aren’t bad, but are not what you came to see.  You find yourself leading Drew to one of the beer stands.

“No, I don’t drink,” Drew informs you when he sees where you are leading him.

Most of the time when Drew drinks he becomes even more awkward and quiet than he already is.  Yet, you are pretty sure that doesn’t have to be the case.

“It is all about your mindset!  You’re here with me, a friend, and we are seeing a kickass band!  Leave it at that - don’t overthink things.  Just think, //fun!//” you encourage your friend.

Drew nods eagerly.

“And alcohol is the same way.  If you come out feeling good and with a desire to be social and have fun...you will.  Simple!  If you come to brood and overthink every damn thing that is just a recipe for a bad time!  So, don’t do that.  Just be happy!”
[[Get a round of drinks]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="450" name="Get a round of drinks" tags="" position="6008,12508" size="100,100">You buy four beers and hand Drew two.  You laugh at his incredulous expression.  “What?  They are small!”

You head back to your seats and drink.  Even Drew seems to enjoy himself after a few tentative sips.

By the time the main attraction begins, you and Drew are on your fourth round.  You are more than comfortably buzzed, the perfect state of mind to enjoy one of your most cherished bands.

Soon the Zombies take the stage and you and Drew head down to the crowded dance floor ground level.

The show begins with a bang and a surprisingly elaborate lightshow.  When the music begins to play in earnest you find yourself drawn towards the stage.  You soon lose sight of Drew in the mass of shifting bodies.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/concert.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fuck yeaaaaaaah!” you scream as your favorite songs reverberate around you.
[[Enjoy the concert]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="451" name="Enjoy the concert" tags="" position="6156,12594" size="100,100">After a few songs, you notice a guy nearby giving you a strange looking thumbs up.  You give him one back and the guy laughs and shakes his head pointing upwards with his index finger.  You aren’t sure what he means until you see him pointing at a young woman crowd surfing towards the stage.

You have never tried anything like that before.  Now, in your new, much lighter frame, it would be an optimal time to try if you were ever curious.

[[Try crowd surfing]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="452" name="Try crowd surfing" tags="" position="6008,12660" size="100,100">
You suddenly find that you are very curious.  You grin at the handsome stranger and use his hand for a foothold as you step into the space above the crowd.  Dozens of hands reach up to grasp you, to carry you forward under the bright, flashing lights.  You give in and let yourself be carried away by the tide of people.  You feel like a goddamn rockstar.

//I am fucking crowd surfing!  Kiiiiiiiiiiiickaaaaaaaaassssssss!// “Woooooooooooo!!”

With your light body, the hands and arms of the crowd eagerly spirit you around the dance floor.  The hands press into your flesh but you don’t care, you’re //fucking flying!//  You’re being groped and prodded but you don’t give a damn, content to bumpily float through the air while one of your favorite bands rains down glorious music around you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/crowdsurf.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fuck yesssssss!  This is the greatest!”

Eventually, after about ten minutes in the air, you float into an area with less density and you are gradually returned to your feet.  You feel completely alive, surging forth on the pleasure of a completely natural high.

Another one of your favorite songs begins and you push your way towards the stage.
[[Try and get as close to the stage as possible]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="453" name="Try and get as close to the stage as possible" tags="" position="6156,12754" size="100,100">“Taylor!” Drew’s voice calls your attention to where your friend has taken refuge at the edge where the standing crowd meets those who are dancing and moshing.

“Drew! I thought I lost you there!” You compliment the music as you snatch one of the drinks from Drew.

“I saw you crowd surfing…” Drew observes with a frown. “Lots of people were grabbing at you.” Drew appears to be making an accusation of some kind. His jealousy and concern are plainly written across his broad face.

Drew’s casual disapproval of one of the coolest moments of your life annoys you. //Why does he care if someone touches me? He is acting like he thinks he is my boyfriend. Boyfriend?? Ughh...// Your beer suddenly has a bad taste to it.

You appreciate Drew looking out for you but you also don’t want him to get the wrong impression. Your relationship is already pushing the bounds of what you are comfortable with. You get the feeling that unless you rebuke Drew sternly he probably won’t stop hovering around you.  //Still, Drew did get me the tickets in the first place…  I wouldn’t be here without him.//

//For both of our sake I should...//

[[Be polite with Drew]]
[[Be direct with Drew]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="454" name="Try and fight back" tags="" position="6292,12940" size="100,100">Your weak fingers try and pry off the molester but his grip is simply too strong.  You silently wish you could bite him but his hands are unfortunately too far away.

As the tempo of the music accelerates, your assailant begins to dry hump you from behind.  You can feel something hard and thick poking into the crevice between your ass cheeks.

“Nooo….”  This is the last thing you want.  You suddenly feel like you are suffocating.  You are trapped.  //Am I going to get raped on the dance floor?//

There is nothing you can do except endure.  No one else around you seems to notice or care what you are doing, all attention is on the band and the stage.

The man behind you withdraws his hands and redeploys them around your waist.

You feel like crying as the man slowly slides your shorts and panties down.  //I can’t believe this is happening!  One of the best nights of my life, is going to be ruined by some perverted asshole with no self control!//

You feel the man’s cock slowly slide forward between your thighs. You can do nothing but wiggle against the press of bodies, all men, stronger and taller than you, standing like immobile walls surrounding you.

“Help!” you shout as the groper’s cock presses against the opening of your vagina.
[[Pray for salvation]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="455" name="Pray for salvation" tags="" position="6444,13006" size="100,100">You pray to a god you don’t completely believe in to save you.  You want the moment to stop more than anything. To your astonishment, it does.  //God is real!//  You feel the press of bodies around you shift and you manage to turn slightly towards your attacker, just in time to see Drew shove the big guy molesting you aside.  The people around you move in response to the disruption.  The molestor, a chubby bearded guy, looks like he is about to punch Drew, yet a bizarre chain of events seems to transpire in slow motion.

Drew’s eyes fall on the man’s pink cock, hanging out of his open fly.  Drew’s face transforms into a look of pure murder as he mentally connects the dots.  Drew pushes the guy again and the man falls backwards, knocking back a large portion of the crowd.  As people turn around, they see an angry man with his penis out struggling to his feet.

One of the men that got shoved looks at the molester.  You can clearly see the other guy mouth “What the fuck?”  Then the man’s eyes fall on the chubby fellow&#39;s dick.  The first man’s reaction is soon repeated a half dozen times by nearby bystanders.  The chubby guy gets to his feet and looks like he is going to slug Drew, but, just before he can, the nearby men begin to push and jostle the bully.  The chubby guy nails one of the other guys in the face and a massive free for all breaks out, most of the blows landing on the pudgy molestor’s body.

[[Slip away]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="456" name="Slip away" tags="" position="6301,13096" size="100,100">You use the commotion to grab Drew’s hand and slip away.  You’re pretty sure that molester dickhead is going to get his ass deservedly kicked.  You briefly imagine what your reaction would have been six months ago.  You are sure that if you caught a guy jerking off in a mosh pit you would probably end up being one of the ones kicking him while he is down.

“Wow, Drew...you like...//saved// me…”  You are genuinely impressed.  Maybe your time with Drew really is helping with his confidence.  

Drew just gives you a sad looking smile.

You feel kind of stupid.  //I should have been more careful but these fucking men need to stop being such molesty-rapey creeps….//  In your mind, they are definitely more at fault than an innocent girl “asking for it” by wearing attractive clothing and having the temerity to go to a concert in public.

//At least Drew is a good guy...//  You breathe a sigh of relief.  If Drew had been even a few seconds later, you would have lost your virginity to a gross stranger on a fucking dancefloor.  Drew may have just saved you tens of thousands of dollars of therapy.  Maybe the mental damage tally has been evened out somewhat.

The Zombies still have about half of their set left so you grab another round of “child-size” beers and enjoy the rest of the concert from the crowd’s edge with Drew.

Despite your near miss rape, you have a great time.  You refuse to let the actions of one creep ruin your night.

At the end, the band is coaxed into an encore by a screaming crowd.  By the time they are finished and finally exit the stage it is nearly one in the morning.
[[Walk with Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="457" name="Walk with Drew" tags="" position="6449,13159" size="100,100">As you step out into the cool night air with the dispersing crowds, you feel anything but tired.  In your mind all the stimulation of the day, the excitement, the fear, the adrenaline, everything mixes into an chemical draught that has you wide awake.  It is Friday and the weekend beckons, there is nothing stopping you from continuing your stimulating night.

You walk with Drew and head towards home. The night is oppressively dark.  You think about the man in the mosh pit and suddenly become self conscious.  //It is dangerous to walk alone at night...//  You had always had a manly confidence, a sense of invulnerability.  Yet now you are nervous walking beside your friend.  The thought of being alone in the dark is suddenly terrifying.

You walk a few blocks and cut through campus.  You reach the fork in your path where you and Drew would normally go your separate ways.

You feel a steady creep of building anxiety.

You and Drew stop.  Drew seems a bit drunk, for he is perpetually red face, fidgeting, and smiling.  //An admitted improvement over “brooding Drew.//

“Do you...want me to walk you home?” Drew offers.  The idea just seems to underscore your change in circumstances.  No matter how hard you try and forget, it seems //other people// won’t allow you to.  “Oh, we could stay up all night and play games!  I got a magic relic yesterday on AA, I can add a poison damage-over-time effect now!” Drew seems quite enthused over his second suggestion.

[[Go stay at Drew’s]]

[[Walk home alone]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="458" name="Go stay at Drew’s" tags="" position="6734,13907" size="100,100">It is still too early and you are bit too buzzed to call it a night.  “Let’s play some AA!” you decide.  Drew seems surprised at your acceptance but smiles and nods eagerly.  The two of you head towards Drew’s place and enjoy a pleasant late night walk.

“I am starving,” you say once safely inside Drew&#39;s place.

“Me too!” Drew admits as he takes out a frozen pizza from the freezer and turns on the oven.

“Mmmm, good choice!”

Hmm…  You still feel a tad inebriated but your buzz is definitely fading.

[[Ask Drew if he has something to drink]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="460" name="Walk home alone" tags="" position="6300,13407" size="100,100">You suddenly feel a bit tired, as if a bit of your adrenaline rush has worn off and sent you crashing in its absence.  Concerts are always pretty active days too, ao you are sure you will sore in the morning from all the moshing and crowd surfing...and groping...//Fuck.//

You look around at the moonlight illuminated street corners.  “I am going to head home,” you inform Drew.

“Sure, I will walk you,” Drew offers.

You realize you have been spending a lot of time with Drew lately.  As awesome as the concert was, you two could definitely use a bit of time apart.  //Besides,// you think, //it isn’t really that late or dangerous around the campus area.//

You politely refuse Drew’s offer to chaperone you.  “I really appreciate you getting those tickets though!”

“It was a really good concert,” Drew agrees with a noodle-like drunk nod.  

“It sure was.  I got to //fly// while listening to one of my favorite bands.  So thanks for that, Drew.”

“Can you text me when you get home safe?” Drew requests.

You laugh at him.  “What are you, my mom?”

“No,” Drew answers.  “I am just worried about you.”

“That’s….”  //Creepy.  Sweet.  Nice...//  “I will be fine, look at how bright it is tonight!  I will cya on monday, Drew.  Thanks again for the fun night.”

You leave Drew behind and start to walk home.  You note the night air begins to cool off rapidly and you get goosebumps.  Eventually, you reach a patch of eerily quiet street.  There is no traffic or bystanders which is a bit unusual given the active campus nightlife and nearby concert venue.
[[You notice a nearby bush that appears to be shaking even in the absence of even the slightest breeze.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="461" name="Ask Drew if he has something to drink" tags="" position="6875,13950" size="100,100">
“Of course!  You want Coke or Sprite?”

[[Suggest something a little “harder”]]
[[Accept the soda]]x</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="462" name="Suggest something a little “harder”" tags="" position="6735,14060" size="100,100">“Do you have anything we could //add// to our cola?” you ask Drew.

“Add to it? Like cherry syrup?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;What do you me---ohhh.  Yeah, I do.”  Drew waddles over to a cabinet and pulls down two unopened bottles, one of rum and one of vodka.

“Perfect!” you shout as you begin to mix a couple drinks.
The two of you relocate to the living room.  With drinks in hand, and the smell of a pizza rising in the oven, you find it too hard to concentrate on AA.  You turn it off and Drew flips the TV to a nature channel with huge-ass manatees gracefully...and kind of dumbly floating around the screen.

The weird looking creatures always make you laugh for some reason.

“What’s wrong?” Drew asks you.

“Nothing, just these manatee things...I always used to think they were fake when I was a kid because they seem really slow and are quite silly looking.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/manatee.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Much to your delight, the manatee on screen squishes his head into the glass of its aquarium.  It is kind of cruel in a way, but you can’t help yourself from laughing uproariously at the poor sea-cow.

Drew clearly doesn’t find the image quite as amusing.  A timer goes off in the kitchen and he disappears for a moment before returning with the pizza.

[[Eat with Drew]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="463" name="Accept the soda" tags="" position="7036,13997" size="100,100">Maybe next time.

With something filling your stomach, you feel your level of tiredness increase.

“Do you want another one?” Drew asks you.  You sway a bit and blink.  //Oh, the drink...Hmmm….//

“Are you having more?”

“I will if you do,” Drew answers.

“Oh...okie-dokie one more round!”

Drew returns with refilled glasses.  He hands you one and you take a sip, nearly spitting it out.  //Holy fuck this is strong!//  Yet rather than criticize Drew’s lack of bartending skills, you smile at him and take very small sips.

“You know, what you did back at the concert there… that was pretty courageous.  You just //have// to rescue every damsel in distress, eh?” you tease your friend.  Perhaps Drew’s gaming compulsion had indeed saved your virtue.  //Still, I don’t exactly like being the damsel...//  It was much more fun to be the knight out fighting dragons than the lonely princess waiting in a tower for his triumphant return.

Drew goes silent, blushing at your praise.

“I really owe you one though.  The concert; you looking out for me.”

“No you don’t!” Drew protests, his intensity catching you off guard.  “This was all to pay //you// back...not for me to rack up debts.”

“I know.  We are friends!  Friends help each other!”

“Right!” Drew agrees.  Yet, after a moment, Drew’s happy expression fades.  You can almost see him make the transition back to “brooding Drew.”

You go to have another sip of your drink, but, to your absolute dismay, you find the glass empty.
[[Have a candid drunk chat with Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="465" name="You pull yourself away." tags="" position="6750,14350" size="100,100">Both you and Drew are obviously incredibly flustered.  You begin to explain that your kiss was an accident, but before you can, Drew pulls you close to him and lays another tender kiss upon your defenseless lips.

Your kiss starts out slow.  You squirm and resist but not for long.  Kissing...being kissed...it feels so good.  Drew kisses you as if he had been waiting for this moment like this for his entire life.

//Fuck, maybe he has...//

Your friend&#39;s lips kiss your own, your neck, and your cheeks until you are red and warm.  //This is so fucked up...but maybe it isn’t so bad.//



 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-989.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; unheight=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 





Soon you find yourself responding to Drew’s efforts.  //Oh my god I am making out with Drew!//

Your presence and Drew’s boner has him in obvious distress.  //Fuck.  I can’t believe I am thinking about my friend’s dick...//

You can tell that Drew wants you badly.  Yet he is too proper, too rigid and so he resists pushing you.  In fact, he doesn’t say anything, just watching you with a look halfway between disbelief and rapture.  You suddenly are reminded of your maid roleplay.  You recall how fun it was to tease Drew...and how liberating it was to just “act” for a time and forget the role of Mr. Roux.

You know Drew might end up becoming a thirty year old wizard.  //At least he isn’t a kissless virgin anymore...err….except I am the one who kissed him.//  You realize your own transformation is probably stressful for your friends as well, Drew especially.  No one knows how to act or feel around you...and find yourself included amongst the ranks of the confused.
 
You look up at Drew’s red cheeks.  You suddenly feel extra drunk and bubbly.  Drew’s pained expression is also strangely humourous to you.  It is obvious you have put him into a near constant state of distress.  It might not be that big of a deal to tease him a bit...and he would probably be forever in your debt.  Besides, there is just the two of you here and Drew is really good at keeping secrets...probably because he doesn’t really have anyone to talk to aside from you.
//Poor Drew...//

With a heavy heart and conflicting emotions, you decide to:
[[Tease Drew again]]

I will show you that your anxiety isn’t a big deal….you don’t have to be nervous around beautiful women.  I am not a //real// woman...but I can help you practice your social skills.”

“I don’t want you to pretend,” Drew whispers to you.

You ignore him.  You try and slip into the role of Taylor the Maid and find the mental experiment to be surprisingly easy.  “That was //so// brave what you did earlier!” you suddenly gush.

“Uh….”

“You’re so //brave,// Drew.  And //big// and //strong//…”

“I…”

“Hey, Drew,” you interrupt him.  “Do you want to see something cool?”

“W-what?”

With a mischievous smirk and a voice screaming in your head to stop, you pull down your shirt and reveal your bare breasts for your friend.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayflash.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Drew nearly has a seizure in response.  Despite his huge porn archives, you are certain yours are the only boobs Drew has ever seen in real life.

Drew releases a shuddering breath.  Drew’s anxiety makes you laugh.  You suddenly feel powerful, sexy, and in complete control.

[[Keep teasing your friend]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="468" name="Keep teasing your friend" tags="" position="6734,14498" size="100,100">“T-Taylor…” Drew says your name in a horribly pained voice.  Your eyes fall on the obvious tent Drew is pitching in his pants.  //Hmmm all men are pervs...even the white knights….maybe especially the white knights...//
You throw your shirt to the ground and crawl over to Drew topless.  Drew watches you with comically large eyes.

A moment of madness seems to seize you as you crawl between Drew’s legs and lay your hand upon your best friend’s crotch.  You can now feel the hard outline of Drew’s boner.  You trace it’s outline with a slender finger.  You feel so hot, so drunk, and so curious and willing to explore.
“Ohh uh… What are you doing!?” Drew hisses as your hand rubs at his swollen crotch.

“I am just helping you out here,” you nonchalantly inform your best friend as you open his fly and help Drew’s cock through his underwear.  //I am touching Drew’s cock...Fwwaaa!  I feel so weird...and dirty...//  Yet the only thing you can imagine to do is continue.

Soon you are staring your friend’s cock in the face.  //Oh fuck!  [[What am I going to do with this?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="469" name="Head back home and search for a cure" tags="" position="6877,14701" size="100,100">You head back home, your awkward night serving as fuel for your search to return to normal.  Once safely locked in your room, you dive into a rabbit hole of mind numbing topics on youtube and some very sketchy looking websites.  

“Minced vampire-chupacabra is an ingredient in gender-bending elixirs according to TSFTales.com!  Fuck...how reliable is this shit?”  You are shocked when you realize it is suddenly after midnight and all you have learned is an assortment of ancient legends and child’s tales.

	“Fuck...What if I am stuck like this?” you wonder as you finally crawl into bed and shut your eyes and sleep.
	
	The next morning you avoid Julie and her boyfriend in the kitchen and go straight to school.  You grab a cinnamon bun from a cart and sit in a series of mind numbing classes.  For some strange reason, you note Karl Marx was brought up in five completely unrelated classes.  //There is definitely something weird going on at this campus...//
	
Your classes pass by in a blur and when they are finished you are left with a familiar question.	

“What the fuck am I going to do now?”  Every idea you have seems to be either quite dumb or lead to a rapid dead end.

	With a heavy heart, you start to walk home, idly thinking of possible search terms.  Your list of possible explanations for your condition is still so short.
	
As students file out of their classes, you notice Drew standing near the Arts building.  Drew looks very haggard.  He has bags under his eyes and looks like he hasn’t slept in days.

You walk up to him and try and cheer him up but he gives you a very uncharacteristic dirty look.

“[[Are you okay, Drew?]]” you ask your friend.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="470" name="You suddenly feel exhausted." tags="" position="6737,14655" size="100,100">You lean back and close your eyes and drift into a fitful sleep.

The next morning you wake up with a headache and some holes in your memory.  You sit up on Drew’s couch, and notice Drew passed out on the other side.

“What the fuck?”  You see that Drew still has his pants pulled down.  His soft, pink cock is resting against his thigh.  You look down and see your bare chest, your perky B-cup breasts slightly observing your view.  Thankfully you are still wearing your shorts but you clearly went topless last night.  //Wait...what?  What the fuck happened!?//  You struggle to recall the events of the last night.

“Oh no…”  You have clearly crossed a serious line with your friend.  With a feeling of shame, you note that one of your oldest friendships might be ruined beyond repair.

You put your bra and shirt back on and stumble out of Drew’s home before you are forced to endure an awkward morning conversation.  

As you walk home you shake your head constantly as your memories return.  What the fuck had gotten into you last night?  You’re a man...yet now what?  You’re kissing guys?  Giving handjobs to your friends?

You fear for your sanity and worry about your future.

“What is going to happen to me?” you wonder.  Your new body’s urges seem to be growing in intensity.  All your relationships are a confusing mess.

[[Head back home and search for a cure]]

“Uhhhhhhhhhh…...G-greatest...” you let a word of your frantic thoughts slip out accidently.

Mitch leans in, penetrating you so deeply his huge cockhead kisses your uterus.  “What are you saying, Taylor?  Oh…”

You blush and look away, but are unable to distance your mind from the sensation of Mitch’s insatiable cock and your equally deprived desires. “I agree, Taylor!  This is the greatest!  Take my fucking cock like the bitch you are.”

“Hnnghh….”  Mitch begins to rail you even harder until you fear your tiny frame might just break apart.

Just as you are about to submit to the beckoning white light of orgasm Mitch withdraws and his glistening, swollen member holds position just outside of your yearning sex.

“No more,” Mitch informs you.

“What!?” you yell out in shock, your lower body squirming helplessly in protest.  You were //so// fucking close to cumming.  

“Tell me that you love my cock,” Mitch orders you.

You slouch forward and give Mitch a prime view of your round bum.  You feel //so// fucking frustrated.  Mitch has you completely ensnared.  You’re horny and you have crazy thoughts and sensations radiating throughout your body.  There is no way you can stop yourself now.

With each submission before Mitch, the next one comes a bit easier. You bite your lip in effort to keep your mouth shut but it is not enough.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/prepen.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I love your cock, Mitch,” you tell your long time bully.

Mitch grins at you eagerly, rubbing his glans against your rose petal like labia.  “And?” he prompts you.

His rubbing is driving you wild.

“I want you to fuck me with it.”

“With what?”

You sigh in exasperation.  “With your fucking cock that I love //so// much!” you angrily shout at him.
[[Let Mitch back inside you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="472" name="Let Mitch back inside you" tags="" position="13145,18394" size="100,100">With a sickening chuckle, Mitch pushes forward, sliding back into your aching sex.
Mitch bangs you for a few minutes before he repositions himself.  He rises into a standing position with you still impaled on his shaft.  He lifts you up as if you were weightless, hooking your calves over his muscular arms.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchpounded2.gif&quot; &gt;
Mitch proceeds to fuck you like you have never been fucked before.  His penis is too big.  It’s too deep inside you.  He’s far too violent.  Yet all you do is moan and take his cock.  You feel like you are being driven insane, your brain is being melted just like your too-hot pussy.  Mitch’s balls slap against you as he repeatedly forces his cock inside you, penetrating you to your deepest recesses.  The room stinks like sex.  The gross, wet sounds are humiliating and awful.  Yet you are powerless to stop the building climactic pressure building within you.  Soon you are launched into the most blissful, twitching, drug and pleasure induced orgasm imaginable.

As your brain maxes out on pleasure chemicals you shiver in fear.  You doubt you will be able to ever match such an intense feeling again, for surely there was no peak of pleasure higher than where you currently reside.

With a throaty groan, Mitch finally comes inside, his pusling cocks spraying and coating your insides with his foul semen.  When he is done cumming inside you, Mitch throws you down onto the bed, like discarding a piece of trash.

You can do nothing but lie on the bed and twitch as your orgasm cycles into a chain of smaller contractions.  You stare up at the ceiling with eyes that aren’t quite seeing.  You can’t imagine a life without ever having such an experience.  Before this moment, you were living in ignorant black and white.  Now you have found a world of high definition and color.

“This….is the best…”

“I know right?  We are just getting started, babe!” Mitch says to you as he climbs back on top of you.

You let Mitch use you until you are both exhausted.

[[You leave at three in the morning, and endure a walk of shame home]]

You masturbate a lot and feel constantly frustrated. 

One day, while stroking yourself to a familiar dick pic, you finally manage to cum.  Yet your orgasm just frustrates you further.  It seems shallow and lacking intensity and feeling.

You have tried to re-climb “the mountain” a few times but never again got close to the summit.

You notice your phone flashing and check your messages.

“Want to join me for some c c?” reads a text from Mitch.

“C-C?  Uh...cock and coke?”  A part of you immediately perks up with the offer.  //What the fuck is wrong with me!?  Why am I even considering this?//

“No…”  You realize with a note of profound sadness that you aren’t even considering the offer.  You have already made up your mind to go, the rest is just mental masturbation without a pleasurable outcome.

You don’t have any other plans...or any good hookups, so you head to Mitch’s.

“Hey, Taylor!” Mitch greets you with enthusiasm when you knock on his door.

“Sup?”

“Not much, same old.”

Mitch leads you the living room.  He cuts you each a nice streak of white powder on the table.

“Go ahead.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taybump.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You snort the line with gusto.  Your happy world reconstitutes itself.  Your color TV subscription has renewed and you revel in the glorious feelings and undulating waves of euphoria that wash over you.

“Now get naked and get sucking!” Mitch orders you.
[[Suck on Mitch’s cock]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="474" name="Suck on Mitch’s cock" tags="" position="13134,18546" size="100,100">His attitude really pisses you off but you find your anger is carried away by drug induced happiness.  Much to Mitch’s delight, you strip down before him and soon begin sucking his cock.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocklick7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You do your best to please Mitch, putting your new skills to work.  You roll your tongue repeatedly over his glans.  You cup his balls and follow every instruction he gives you.

Ten minutes of stroking and licking later, Mitch erupts like a volcano, covering your face with hot white lava.

“What the fuck are you doing?” You screech at Mitch as he takes out his phone and points it at you.

You are blinded by a flash as Mitch snaps a picture of your cum covered face on his phone.

You laugh outright at Mitch.  “You can’t blackmail me, you stupid piece of shit!  Look at me, you think I give a fuck what other people think?”

“That one was just to wank to later,” he informs you with an insulting tone of voice.

“I thought we were past all this bullshit,” you say, trying to guilt him into a modicum of human decency.

“I will tell you what is going to happen, Taylor.  You are going to come over to my place every night and we are going to fuck.  And we both know that you are going to love it because you are a stupid whore who is addicted to cock.”
You shake your head in disbelief.  “I don’t need that many drugs!” 

//Everything that has happened has been blackmail, or him taking advantage of me...the rest was just a trade,// you tell yourself, and the rationalizations sound good in your mind.

“This isn’t about drugs,” Mitch scoffs.  “It is about you doing what I say.  It is super obvious you //want// to be my slut.  So please be a good bitch and show up at say 9pm on weekdays and we will //hang out,//” he says with a sickening wink.

“I seriously hope you are fucking joking!” you explode at him.  You take a deep breath to calm yourself, inadvertently inhaling the stench of Mitch’s cum that is still covering your face.  //Agghg!  God damnit!//
“Taylor, there are so many things you don&#39;t know.  You think you’re so fucking smart, but the truth is you’re like a fucking bimbo-in-waiting!  You don’t know //shit.//” 

Your anger bubbles to the surface.  “You should just fucking kill yourself, Mitch!  You are a piece of shit and the world will be so much better when you are just a stain on the ground.”
[[Mitch laughs at your tirade.]]

If you only knew about some of the shit I have seen--some of the shit I have been //forced// to do.  You’re just a stupid cumslut and you are going to come over to my place every night and service me like a //good little girl,//”  Mitch makes the last words an extra taunt, a bald-faced slap across your face.

“I am not your slave,” you tell him as you ignore his bullshit and head to the washroom to clean up.

You head straight to the door but Mitch stops you.

“Promise me you are going to show up tomorrow.”

“Fuck you!” you scream at him.

“No, fuck you!” Mitch counters.  He steps forward and grabs you by the throat.  He squeezes until you can’t breathe or fight back.  Your vision goes spotty as you fear for your life.  You know Mitch could kill you in a second if he wanted too.  You feel terrified and weak.  “You need to learn who is in control here,” Mitch continues berating you. “It’s //me!//  Now you are gonna do what I say or you and your entire family will definitely regret it.  A few words in the right ear and your existence is over.  //They// will come in black vans and pick you up.  You will be experimented on and dissected.  They will kill you after torturing and experimenting on you for a decade or two and then cut your body into tiny little fucking slides to study for generations.  And if that isn’t enough and you just want to run away like a pussy...well, then your stupid friends might just have a few “accidents” around campus.  Now are you going to //man-up// and show tomorrow or do I have to get //nasty?//”

Mitch&#39;s threats are so serious and delivered with such vehemence you cannot doubt their veracity.  With tears in your eyes, you nod at Mitch.  He releases you and you gasp for breath as he shoves you outside.

“See ya tomorrow, Taylor!” he says to you cheerfully as he slams the door on you and forces you out into the hall.

On the way home, your sense of despair is so great you are almost sobbing by the time you make it [[back into the safety of your room.]]

You do what any red blooded man would do with a gorgeous willing babe in front of him, you squeeze your sisters breasts and kiss her back. 

You make out with your sister for what seems like hours.  Finally Julie takes off her own shirt and unclips her bra, revealing her perfect chest.  Your throat goes dry as you gaze into a mirror image of perfection.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/julietaylorsislove.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh!” you shout as your sister presses up against you and works her hands back into your wetpanties.  Julie expertly massages your clit until you are quivering against her hand, vainly humping her fingers to push yourself towards the beckoning white light that threatens to consume you.  You let it and have the most intense orgasm of your life, shuddering up against your sister while she invades your mouth with her tongue.

“Was that your first time with a woman?” Julie asks you with a grin as you twitch out on the bed.

“Yeah…” you admit.

“Don’t worry, Tammy.  It won’t be your last!” Julie predicts as she begins kissing you, slowly descending down your body while leaving a trail of red blotches.  When Julie gets to your pussy you shake your head side to side.

Julie giggles and ignores you, plunging into your red hot pussy and the copious juices that now cover everything //down there.//

“Mmmm….Tammy.  This is way too nice of a pussy for Taylor,” Julie grumbles as she licks and rubs at your most intimate and sensitive spots.

You shouldn’t even have a pussy!  Let alone one that is being eaten out by your fucking sister!  //What the hell has happened to me?  This is like...incest...fuck….//  You had always been somewhat weirded out by incest porn.  Living with and seeing your family members up close on a daily basis made them horribly unattractive.  Yet now you are compromised in the midst of a taboo act.  You want to be disgusted, to push Julie and her practiced tongue away from your naughty bits, but you cannot find the strength to repel her.

An hour later, you meet her at the sandwich shop she recommended.

You buy lunch and chow down while joking with Rhea.  You and Rhea have always gotten along fairly well, since her adventurous tomboy personality meshes fairly well with your own.

//Yet...we are both girls...weird...//

After the meal, Rhea grabs your hand and begins teasing you with a playful finger.

“Rhea… I have something I should tell you.”

“Oh hush.  Let&#39;s not ruin things with words. I just can’t help myself when I see something I want.  You just seem so familiar, you know?”  

//Rhea... wants me? Err. I am not a thing!//

Rhea laughs at first, but as you plow on, gradually her expression shifts to disbelief… and then to evident concern over your mental health.

But you refuse to stop until you have gotten everything off your chest, metaphorically of course.

“So...we are friends,” you wrap up.  “Things are just really weird.  I am trying to figure things out while not drawing attention to myself or ruffling any feathers.  I didn’t mean to lie to everyone.  Please forgive me, Rhea.”

“So, you’re Taylor Roux - the girl?” Rhea summarizes.  You frown but nod.

“You know, I am normally not so gullible but you do bear an uncanny resemblance to Julie.  Your story is...pretty good too.  You are either insane or telling the truth,” she concludes.

“Which do you think it is?” you ask Rhea.  She giggles as she swishes her long blonde hair around.

“Either way is interesting to me!” she informs you with a grin.

//She believes me!?// You are amazed you were able to convince Rhea so easily.  //Maybe I am pretty persuasive!  Hmm... or maybe Rhea is kind of gullible...//

“Wow.  If your story is true, you have some serious catching up to do!” Rhea remarks.

“What do you mean?”

Rhea grabs your hand and drags you to her house that she shares with Jimmy and another roommate.

She leaves you in her bedroom and returns a moment later with a small bottle of green oil.

“What is that?”

“Grapeseed oil: great on the skin, awesome in the pussy!” she informs you.

“Uh….”  You feel yourself heating up with the mere suggestion of sexual contact.  Rhea’s proximity, her big eyes and plump limps along with her fresh citrus scent is driving you nuts.  There is no way you could refuse such a beautiful woman.

“Lie down!” Rhea orders you with mock sternness.

“Ah!  Not like that.  Strip first.”  She shakes her head in evident disbelief at your faux pa.  You strip to your underwear while Rhea stares at you.

“What?”

Rhea makes a flicking gesture with her hand.  With your face flushing in embarrassment, you slide off your underwear and lie down on a towel Rhea puts on her bed.

It feels cold, but soon Rhea’s hands heat it up as she works it into your skin.  Rhea gives you an excellent back massage.

“Mmmmm….Wow, you’re really good at this.  Where did you learn this?”

“Oh...uh, from work,” Rhea replies vaguely.  Rhea grabs your shoulder and gently flips you onto your back.  The frontal massage is much more intimate and pleasurable.  Rhea leaves no part of you untouched.  Her hands coax moan after moan from you.  Her fingertips rub your areola until your nipples are hard and aching.  Rhea rubs your thighs and everywhere except the place in your center where you desire her to touch you the most.  Eventually, Rhea’s oil slick hands oblige your deepest desires.  She starts slowly at first and then proceed to massage your clit with ever greater intensity.  Rhea caresses and plays with your labia and vaginal opening until you feel so uncomfortably wet the rest of you seems to be dehydrated.

“Oh. Oh. OH!”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/handsonpleasure.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; unclass=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Just oil, a towel, two beautiful women, and Rhea’s magical, soft yet strong hands equates to bliss.

Soon you are left convulsing, your hips buck forth unbidden.  Your legs and butt along with your very pussy itself twitches and spasms.  You feel like your entire brain has short circuited via pleasure overload.  You have never felt or imagined such an intense feeling of pleasure was even possible.

It takes you a long time to recover.  Rhea has blown your mind.  You can’t even move.

“See!  I figured you needed to get //acquainted// with your new body.  Being a woman is pretty great, isn’t it?” Rhea teases you.

“Yeah...It is //amazing//…”

You lap up everything you can, spiraling your tongue with delicate head movements until, guided by Rhea’s moans, you find her sweet spot.

“Uhhhhhhhhhnnn!” Rhea clenches up and grabs the back of your head, working her long fingers through your hair. “Keep going!” she breathlessly urges you. “C’mon, Taylor! Use that naughty tongue for something useful instead of swearing!”

//Ahh… I am fucking Rhea with my tongue!// 

Rhea’s shuddering legs wrap around your head as Rhea rides her bucking hips against your face. You are forced to breathe through your nose, inhaling Rhea’s delightfully intoxicating scent with every inhalation. 

“Ummmphh! Mmmmmmmmm…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheatongued.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

As Drew looks at the screen his eyes bulge and nearly pop out of his head.  His expression is one of shock, then confusion, followed by disbelief and absolute //horror// and utter capitulation.

With a trembling finger, Drew swipes the phone, revealing more pictures of Taylor.  “No way,” Drew says to himself, his voice barely a whisper.
The next second Evan snatches his phone back.  Drew, defeated and crestfallen, turns and stumbles away without another word, clearly lost in a daze and unwilling or unable to stick around any longer.

You freeze when you see the bear.  The bear looks positively enraged and potentially very hungry.  The bear’s lips curl back revealing jagged yellow teeth, while a trail of white drool drips to the ground from the beast’s slavering maw.  

//Oh no,nononononononono!//

A thousand panicked thoughts surge through your mind in an instant.  Your mouth goes dry as your eyes turn to look at Evan and then back at the bear.  A life or death tension descends upon the three of you.  It seems to be a bizarre three way standoff - no party apparently eager to make the first move.  All three of you appear equally surprised and the other’s appearance.

You are trying to frantically recall random information about bears.  Should you run?  Yell?  Play dead?  You are pretty sure you recall hearing that playing dead is the safest option...but that might be for a different species of bear.  //Fuck!//  Time is of the essence.  Every second is one you could be using to distance yourself from this monstrous beast.  Your heart is now thundering in your chest and pulsing through your ears until it drowns out all other sound.  You want to scream, run, and fight all at the same instant.

Craig was the Bell&#39;s adopted son.  Due to his biological parent&#39;s mistakes, Craig was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and some severe mental and physical handicaps.  You also highly suspect that his birth parents had abused him.  Although Craig was now a grown man, he still had the disposition of a child and the level of responsibility to match.  Most of the time he was fairly placid and ordinary but it was plain that his brain functioned in different ways than the average person.  Sometimes he seemed, well, like a few others you had seen with similar birth conditions: Craig was like an overgrown child.  Craig was always in special needs classes but he definitely wasn&#39;t dumb, for there were moments where it was obvious that there was more than a glimmer of intelligence behind Craig&#39;s slightly lopsided eyes.  He also seemed to possess a suprisingly good, albeit inconsistent, memory.

	Sill, Craig&#39;s awkward movement, crippling speech impediment, and immaturity made it very difficult for Craig to find and hold any sort of job.  Those he did find he found stressful and would invariably quit.  Life wasn&#39;t fair and it&#39;s lottery was often painful.  You can&#39;t help but feel a bit guilty and sad as you realize that as you had been partying the summer away, poor Craig had been sick with pneumonia and a bad infection that had left him bedridden.

The strange man is dressed in a sharp cut suit and his dark sunglasses almost make him look like an FBI agent or something.  Just as you make that observation, you see a little patch of white behind the guy&#39;s ear.  //The guy is wearing a fucking earpiece!//  Your stomach twists into a knot.  You ask yourself who would be dressed like that and soon find you don’t like any of the answers you come up with.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/suspiciousman.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	“What the fuck?”
	
	Suddenly the man’s constantly sweeping vision detects you.  //Oh fuck.  Fuck!// You can instantly tell by the man’s reaction that you are his target.  Something inside you screams to run so you do and the man takes off running after you in pursuit.  To your terror, you find the suit clad man is fast.  //Very// fast.  You run until your lungs are heaving and your vision is spotty.  You don’t dare turn around, for the man is [[hot on your heels]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="498" name="hot on your heels" tags="" position="6740,14945" size="100,100">	//This is sooooo fucked!  How the hell did my life come to this!?// Fearing iminent capture, you scream.  “Heeeeeeeeeeeeelllppp!!!!!” you wail.  As the sound of your lingering scream echoes around you, you see several bystanders take note of your plight.  //Thank fuck!  Calling the cops is better than being murdered by whoever the fuck this guy is!//  You use the momentary distraction to put more distance between you and the man in the suit.  You run towards Drew’s house.
	
	//Thwack.  Thwack.  Thwack.  Thwack.//  You can hear your follower’s rapid footsteps getting louder.
	
	“Ohhhh shit!”  //This guy is right on top of me!//
	
	Just as you are certain you will be caught, you spot a possible source of salvation.  //Drew!//  You have never been so glad to see your portly friend.
	
	You see Drew leaving a fast food restaurant near his house.  You change your heading and charge right by him. “Heeeeeeeelp!” you yell as you zip by Drew.
	
	As Drew spots you his mouth falls open.  He freezes as you run past him, yet your movement eventually sparks Drew into action, for he bravely steps in front of the man to block his path.  The two collide with a bang that you hear from a hundred paces away.
	
	//Ouch that had to hurt.  I am so fucking sorry Drew!  I will make it up to you, I promise.//  At least Drew has a clean ID card and no reason to be abducted.  You, on the other hand...well, you are beginning to suspect there is a lot of really creepy people that want you locked up in their [[basement laboratories]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="499" name="basement laboratories" tags="" position="6881,15003" size="100,100">	You turn back to see the man in the suit rising from the sidewalk.  The man’s eyes lock onto you with a look of pure murder.  Just as he resumes his pursuit, the well dressed man is stopped by a trembling hand that grasps his pant leg.  The agent nearly stumbles to the ground but recovers in the nick of time and manages to stay upright.  You hear Drew shout at your pursuer but cannot make out the words.
	
	Drew’s valiant efforts buy you the time you need to finally put some serious obstacles between you and your follower.  The last thing you see before ducking into an alley, is the man in the suit kicking Drew in the face.  //Hard.//  
	
	“Holy fuck!  He could have killed Drew!  What a fucking maniac!”  You are terrified for Drew’s safety, but your fear for your own skin momentarily supersedes his.  Although you feel like a coward, your boiling fears are the only thing coherent about you right now.  You have a near certain feeling that getting caught by that man would be a disaster that would ultimately end with your death or permanent disappearance.
	
	So you just keep running.  You run until you are sure you can’t go any farther, and then you run some more.  You turn another corner and walk into a coffee shop.  Several people seated near the entrance give you a strange look as you huff and puff for a moment.  You buy an iced green tea smoothie and sit in the back of the shop.  As you sip your heavenly beverage with shaking hands, you [[try and collect yourself.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="500" name="try and collect yourself." tags="" position="6737,15105" size="100,100">	You take out your phone.  You want to call 9-11 and make sure Drew is okay but yet you can’t //quite// manage to press your finger down on the send button.  //What if they track me?//
	
	You walk back up to the shop counter.  “Can I use your phone?” you ask the clerk.  The clerk bites his lip in annoyance.  “Please,” you say while setting five dollars down on the counter.
	
	“A beautiful lady like you doesn’t have to pay for the phone, just be quick.”
	
	“Thanks!”
	
	You dial 911.
	
	“Hello, emergency dispatch, how may I direct your call?” 
	
	“Hey I uh...I just saw some nutcase chase a...lady through the street on 107th, near the university!  The guy was clearly a psycho.  He was dressed in a suit and he kicked some other guy in the face when he tried to intervene.  That poor man needs help--not the guy in the suit though, he deserves a jail cell!  Please send the cops and an ambulance!” you tell the operator before hanging up.
	
	As you step away from the phone, the coffee clerk gives you a look of disbelief.  He had clearly been eavesdropping on your conversation.
	
	You awkwardly shuffle away and find yourself walking back outside.  You have an intense desire to double back and check on Drew but you know that suspicious man or others like him [[could be lurking anywhere]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="501" name="could be lurking anywhere" tags="" position="6875,15153" size="100,100">	//Still, fuck, I just left Drew on the side of the road...his neck could be broken...What kind of person am I?//  “The kind of person who fears for his fucking life,” you answer your own question.  Still, sacrificing Drew’s life for your own was not your intention, nor a trade you would ever make.  Although it wasn&#39;t your intention, Drew was hurt and there was no way to change that stark reality.
	
	You can’t resist returning to the scene of the incident and gradually find yourself edging back towards Drew’s house.  When you get back to 107th street you sheepishly loiter near a police car as you survey the field.
	
	Your heart falls when you see Drew get pushed into the back of an ambulance.  He is wearing a neck brace.  Your friend’s pudgy face is bruised, bloodied, and battered.  He doesn’t appear to be conscious.
	
	//Holy shit!  Drew!  All that because of me!//
	
	The ambulance leaves and you follow after it.
	
	“That’s the woman there!” a bystander speaking to a police officer shouts and points at you.
	
	//For fuck’s sake!//  You manage to awkwardly and very slowly run away and hide behind some bushes.  You feel paranoid and scared but slowly creep forth and work your way to the university hospital where you hope you will find Drew.
	
	[[Go to the hospital and look for Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="502" name="Go to the hospital and look for Drew" tags="" position="6741,15253" size="100,100">	As you walk into the university hospital you cast nervous glances around the lobby.  You walk up to the receptionist.  “Hello I had a friend get injured.  I think they brought him here.  Is Drew Drachmann here?  Is he okay?”  You pepper the poor lady behind the desk with your frantic questions.
	
	The receptionist checks her computer.  “Yes, Drew Drachmann was brought in two hours ago.  He just got out of surgery…”
	
	“//Surgery!?//  Is he okay?”
	
	“His injuries were fairly serious…You should speak to his doctor.  Drew is resting in room 102.”
	
	You rush by the receptionist.  “Left!” the receptionist calls out and you turn down the hall she directs.
	
	You find Drew lying in bed in a dark hospital room.  He is wearing a neck brace is propped up awkwardly on the bed.  He looks like shit.  He has an IV in his arm and an oxygen mask covering his face along with a fresh cast on his left wrist.  Even though his swelling has come down considerably since you saw him get carted away, Drew’s face is still lumpy and full of abrasions and purple mounds.   You feel absolutely wretched as you stare at Drew, recovering from blows clearly meant for you.
	
	“God damnit!  I should have just stood my ground…Maybe, together with Drew, I could have fought him off.”  //Or maybe Drew would still be in the hospital and I would be in a freezer somewhere...//
	
	“He has sustained a very serious head injury,” a doctor’s voice startles you.  “We have done all we can,” the doctor explains.  “Most of the injuries are fairly superficial but his head is the serious issue.  If he doesn’t wake up within twenty-four hours there is a significant chance of [[mental impairments.]]  We are dimming the lights for a possible concussion but his scans looked clean so I am optimistic.”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="503" name="mental impairments." tags="" position="6885,15299" size="100,100">“That’s awful!  This is all my fault,” you confess to the doctor.

	“Are you his sister?”
	
	“No,” you sniff.
	
	The doctor raises an eyebrow.  “Girlfriend?”
	
	“No, I am just a friend…”  //Who happens to be a girl...temporarily I still hope.//
	
	“Oh, well I will say there is an excellent chance he wakes up.  And if not, well...we will cross that bridge when we come to it.”
	
	The doctor’s words and their potentially fatal implication make your head spin.  //What have I done!?//  You should have ran into the park.  Or into oncoming traffic...almost anything would be better than this.
	
“Drew got beat up because of me!”  //This is all my fault.  Please don’t die Drew!//  “You thought I was your friend, now look at you.  You’re barely alive because of me…God damnit….”  //Why did I ask Drew for help?  Why was he destined to be there for you exactly when you needed him?//  You try and imagine a life without Drew and discover that you simply can’t.  //Fuccccccck………..//

	You fall asleep at his bedside, your tears staining Drew’s bedsheet.
	[[You wake up to the cries of a distraught woman.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="504" name="You wake up to the cries of a distraught woman." tags="" position="6745,15401" size="100,100">	“Oh my god!  My sweet little Drew!  What have they done to you!?” a familiar sounding old woman wails.
	
You open your eyes and see Mrs. Drachmann next to Drew’s bedside.  She starts crying immediately as she cups her son’s swollen cheek. 

	You give the poor woman a few moments before interrupting her grief.
	
	“Mrs. Drachmann, I am so sorry,” you finally apologize.  Drew’s mom jumps and turns to face you.  Her eyes go wide, it is clear she only just noticed your presence in the room.
	
	“Who are you?”
	
	“I am…”  Your words falter as you struggle to come up with words that are truthful but not overly controversial or revealing.  “I am one of Drew’s friends from school.  There was this crazy guy chasing me and Drew tried to step in.  He saved me but ended up like this,” you explain.  As you speak, you find your voice becomes increasingly emotional until eventually your vision is clouded with tears.  “I am sorry!  I didn’t want this to happen.”
	
	Tears continue to well in your eyes but a gentle finger brushes them away.  The finger belongs to Mrs. Drachmann.  “It’s okay.  //You// didn’t do that to him, that awful man did.  I raised Drew to be a good boy.  He knows the difference between right and wrong.  Sometimes my son makes me so proud...stepping in to protect a pretty little thing like you.  I am sure he has no regrets.  That’s my //little Drew!//  I just wish he wasn’t so beat up…”
	
	Speaking of Drew’s injuries causes the older woman to break down.  You find yourself drawn to her and you wrap your arms around each other and soon you are both hugging each other as you [[sob silently into each other.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="505" name="sob silently into each other." tags="" position="6889,15447" size="100,100">Mrs. Drachmann stays by her son’s bedside with you for several hours.  She holds Drew’s free hand for most of it.  

“What’s your name, sweetie?”

You sigh.  You cannot bear to lie to this woman.  Not after almost killing her son.  “Taylor,” you answer.  You meant to throw out your last name as well but it gets stuck on the tip of your tongue.

“Pretty name.  I know Drew has another friend named Taylor.  He just needs one more and then he would be impossible to understand.”

You try and smile hopefully.  The two of you say very little, wallowing in a tense, worried silence as the length of Drew’s unconscious spell keeps steadily increasing. 

Eventually Mrs. Drachmann gets up with an irritated huff.

“I am going to get us something to eat.  Maybe the smell will wake Drew up.  He always wakes up hungry,” Mrs. Drachmann relates hopefully.  “Even sleeping like a log, he will wake up for bacon.  I would rather try //something// than just sitting here.  I am going to go get him his favorite food!”

“That is a great idea.  But I am not hungry.  I will stay here with Drew while you go.”

Mrs. Drachmann shoots a sad but warm smile.  “Okay, watch him for me, dear.  I will see you shortly.”

[[You take Mrs. Drachmann’s seat.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="506" name="Go inside your house" tags="" position="4240,4447" size="100,100">Shaking your head in disbelief, you enter your house and lock the door tightly behind you.  You tap away at your computer and make a huge list of seemingly random topics that may be related to your condition.

Eventually, you lie down on your bed and fall asleep.  You sleep peacefully, but have strange dreams about caterpillars transforming into butterflies.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/butterfly.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In the morning you wake up to the sound of someone shouting your name.

[[Respond to the voice]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="507" name="Author is a troll." tags="" position="2304,8701" size="100,100">	You let the internet work for you and go and have a shower.  As you let the hot water splash over you, your hands inevitably wander.  You let your shower and exploration go on until you are pruny...and still unsatisfied.  You step outside and towel off, heading to your room before disrobing.  You then lie down on your bed and continue masturbating.  Your hands are drawn to the tingling and strangely wet flesh between your legs.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempleasure.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	You put your perverted mind to work and your hands spring to obey.  You rub your clit in gentle but quick and firm swirls while penetrating yourself with your middle fingers in a shallow but determined and strangely rhythmic motion.  
	
	&quot;Uhhhnnn!&quot; You can&#39;t help but let out a high pitch moan.  You find the perfect pace for optimal pleasure and continue on in that manner until you feel yourself building to an intense orgasm.  Just as you are about to cum, your ring finger wanders a bit too low and touches a different, more sensitive ring.  Your asshole is already slick with your love juice.  Your dripping, woefully aroused pussy has soaked everything around it.  You find the sudden anal stimulation is the [[straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="508" name="straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back." tags="" position="2145,8750" size="100,100">You cum so hard you are left spasming on the bed for a few minutes.  You rub your legs together as a warm feeling radiates from them and spreads throughout your body.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempovlegs.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You sigh as you look down at your legs.  They still look weird, like they don&#39;t quite belong.  Every time you look down you half expect to see your cock and balls...instead you see nothing except a void.  A void that you suddenly have an urge to fill.

[[Continue masturbating]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="509" name="Continue masturbating" tags="" position="2301,8846" size="100,100">end of current update</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="510" name="you yell at Evan." tags="" position="510,8534" size="100,100">“I would stare regardless,” Evan replies while leering at your chest.  As you awkwardly cross your arms to hide your breasts, Evan continues his stupid, unrelated story, “Alexander Jones&#39; Premium Bone Broth has healing properties and shit- hey maybe that could help you out!”

You have a sudden urge to slap Evan.  Instead you just face-palm.  “Evan, please shut up.”  You turn towards your portly friend.  “//Drew!//  Any bright ideas?”

Drew requests that you explain more about how you felt when you transformed.  You relate the disturbing experience as best you can.

“Hmmm…” Drew responds after digesting everything you have told him.  &quot;Yeah, I haveno idea….I had a few theories but none of them would match with your story.”

“Oh fuck…”  If a really smart guy like Drew reaches the same conclusion you have, your optimism is blunted.

“So we are on to the wild theories then!  That’s kind of cool.  Did you find any suspicious spell books lately?  Oh I know- you made a vague promise with a demon!” Evan speculates.  “You should be careful with that shit,” he chides you.

You roll your eyes.  “Whatever happened to me is //fucking real...// It wasn’t fucking aliens or magic!”  //I REALLY hope it wasn’t aliens or magic...//  “The transformation is real.  I mean, fuck, just look at me.”

“Oh, I have been,” Evan interjects while wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.

You scowl at Evan.  “Evan please be quiet unless you have something useful to add.”

Evan pouts.  “I was just trying to help you out!”
	“[[You’re not helping!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="511" name="You’re not helping!" tags="" position="654,8592" size="100,100">“Taylor is right,” Drew agrees.  “What we need is some lab equipment and tests.  We also need to research scientific explanations for such a transformation.”

	“Yes!  That!  Thank you, Drew.”
	
	Drew smiles at you.  “Oh and we should find some professionals to assist us.”
	
	“What kind of professionals?”
	
	“Well, maybe we can’t make that judgement yet but surely a few doctors or researchers, maybe a nanotechnology engineer or something…”
	
	“I don’t know who to trust yet.”  //For all I know my transformation is related to an allergic reaction and AJ’s Premium Bone Broth is the only cure.//
	
	The only solution appears to be for you to learn more about your condition.
	
	“I got an idea!” Evan announces and you shoot him a look that says, “It better be fucking relevant or I will kill you.”
	
	“We go to my dad’s clinic.  In and out, easy peasy.  They have a lab and everything.”
	
	“Congratulations on the good idea!” you praise Evan and he grins.
	The three of you walk to the clinic.  Evan makes stupid jokes while Drew flips through search results on his phone.
	
	//This was a great idea!// you mentally cheer.  You have enlisted Drew’s research skills and Evan’s family connections to your cause.  For the first time since your transformation, you feel [[optimistic about your future]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="512" name="optimistic about your future" tags="" position="506,8686" size="100,100">Once you arrive at the clinic, Evan slips behind the receptionist desk with a brief word to the secretary.  You and Drew wait in the lobby.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/clinicout.jpg&quot;  class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Don’t worry, Taylor!  We will help you figure this out.  At the very least we will find you a trustworthy doctor to examine you.”

“I am well past a regular doctor.  I need a mad scientist or, I don’t know, a priest?  Maybe a witch doctor!”

Drew scowls at the mention of the last two.  Drew is rational to a fault and is prone to almost stupid levels of disbelief if he lacks scientific proof.

“Well, I already got a decent list of potential avenues for research.  Whatever happened to you is clearly cutting edge technology.”

“Or magic,” you tease.

Drew gives an exasperated sigh.  “Sufficiently advanced technology only //appears// to be magic.”

Finally Evan reappears and waves you into a small room.  Inside is a cheerful looking nurse and some [[basic lab equipment.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="513" name="basic lab equipment." tags="" position="664,8738" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/clinicinside.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You submit to a thorough but blessedly quick battery of tests.  You get a blood, hair, and saliva test.

“One last thing,” the nurse adds.  “Pee in the cup.”

“Huh?”

“Please pee in the cup,” the nurse repeats her request, handing you a small plastic cup.

“Uh, we will give you some privacy,” Drew awkwardly mumbles as your friends shamble out of the room.

You follow the nurse outside and step into the washroom... the //woman’s// washroom, since that is the one the nurse eagerly beckons you to enter.  //Fucking hell...//

Once inside the oddly fruity smelling bathroom, you immediately feel overly self conscious.  With a sigh, you make your way to the [[toilet in the corner of the room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="514" name="toilet in the corner of the room." tags="" position="516,8834" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytoilet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You pull your panties down and sit on the toilet.  You look down at your soft skinned, pale legs and frown.  Your frown upgrades itself to a grimace as your eyes sweep over your panties and your pussy.  //I shouldn’t have any of those fucking things!//  You feel frustrated and depressed.  You hold the cup under your...vagina and try and urinate.  With your nerves, coupled with the newness of your “equipment” and the proximity of the nurse and your friends, you just can&#39;t //quite// seem to go.

“God damnit!  Why does everything have to be so hard?”

You take a deep breath and attempt to relax both yourself and your pubic muscles.  Finally your begins to empty and you fill the tiny cup while being overly conscious of the strange yet familiar sensation.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taypee.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Urinating as a woman felt much the same as it did as it had when you were a man, yet their seemed to be an extra pressure and you note the odd lack of a pleasurable after tone.  Your watch your yellow urine fall from your //pussy// and you flush with embarrassment.  The view was amazing but you were not quite used to it enough to enjoy.

Once finished, you [[have your sample.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="515" name="have your sample." tags="" position="664,8892" size="100,100">You wash up and step outside, handing your sample to the nurse.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/urine.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You hope you can learn something valuable from all this.

“We will put a rush on it,” the nurse informs you.

“Thanks!”

You step outside the clinic with your friends.  Your hopeless situation seems a lot less hopeless.  You feel you have made a lot of progress.
“If we work together I am pretty sure things will work out,” Drew assures you.  He doesn’t sound very confident but you find that you certainly appreciate the words.

“Yep!  When we are together everything is awesome!  We all blend together to form a super-human like blob of impressive humanity!”

“That is certainly one way to put it,” Evan dryly replies.

“I owe you guys!  You’re the best friends a guy could ask for!” you praise your friends.

“//Girl.//”

Evan’s one word response makes you raise an eyebrow.  “Huh?”

“You said, “guy,” but you’re a girl now though,” Evan corrects you.

“Evan, you appear to be missing the entire fucking point.  I am 100% man, that’s why it is imperative that I find a way to change back ASAP.”

“Total babe.  One hundred percent man... //gotcha//.”

You ignore Evan’s idiocy.  “With you two helping me, I am way more confident than being miserable and alone.  Let’s each brainstorm tonight and we will see what we can come up with tomorrow!  Thanks again guys!” you shout over your shoulder as you head home, eager to do a little bit of “experimentation” and testing of your own.
[[Head home and experiment]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="516" name="Head home and experiment" tags="" position="516,8986" size="100,100">An hour later, you find yourself standing naked in the bathroom.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taynaked.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“It is only natural if I do this, right?” you ask your reflection.  You eagerly nod assent. //She is willing!  Hehe!//  “Alright, let’s give this body a good test drive!”

You cup your breasts and run your soft fingers over your rapidly stiffening areolas.  You retreat to your bedroom and lie down on your bed.  You slowly begin to explore your tingling lower body.

	Your soft skin is sensitive.  You rub yourself and find your fingers keep moving deeper into your warm, feminine folds.

	“Eeeck!” you squeak as your finger pulls back a small hood of skin and rubs an extremely sensitive bud of flesh.

	//Is that my … clit? Fuck,I have a clit...//

Your hands don’t //quite// get the job done.  You are left with a deep itch you can’t seem to scratch.

Your mind wanders.  You wonder what it what it would like to have [[something a little bigger inside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="517" name="You notice a nearby bush that appears to be shaking even in the absence of even the slightest breeze." tags="" position="6434,13461" size="100,100">“What the hell?” you wonder as you step forward out of a sense of curiosity.  The high of attending the concert, the alcohol, and the beautiful night air goads you forth.

//Scchhhhhhh Zccccccccchhh!//  The bushes behind you rustle.
You spin around to face the sound.  “Who’s there!?” you shout at the bushes but there is no reply.  As you stop and listen for any sound, the wind picks up and begins to rustle through the bushes in a manner that makes you blame your imagination.  You breathe a sigh of relief and turn back to your initial curiosity.

You can hear a very faint sound that you cannot identify.  You notice a bush right in front of you start to shake, as if it was shivering from the cold.

“Got ya!” you yell as you dash forward and [[push open the bushes.]]

“Oh!  A bunny!”  //Or more like a garbage fed rabbit...//

There was probably a brief moment where you could have grabbed it, but you chose to leave the rabbit alone.  After a second of frozen terror, it bounds away and you giggle at it as it retreats.

You stretch your arms and yawn.  “It is definitely time to get home…”   Your voice drops off as you catch the image of something [[large and dark in your peripheral vision.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="519" name="large and dark in your peripheral vision." tags="" position="6437,13610" size="100,100">You are shocked when you realise there are two men with balaclavas looming behind you.

You elbow the man grabbing you in his stomach and he grunts.  You try and slip out of his hold but your attacker’s grip is too strong.  The other man punches you in your stomach in reward for your resistance.  You feel the air in your lungs get forced out.  You struggle to inhale but only a hoarse, wailing wheeze emerges from your throat.  You find yourself falling but the man holding you keeps you upright.  They begin to drag you away from the main road and into a nearby parking lot that is [[adjacent to a small park.]]

You look up at the full moon above and pray it is bright enough for someone to notice and help you.  The obvious downside is you will get a good view of what is about to happen to you.  You had some bizzare fetishes before your transformation but first person rape was definitely not one of them.  The man holding you lets his hand sink a bit too far into your mouth.  You seize the opportunity and bite down on the man’s thumb with all your might.  “AHHHH!!” the man yells in pain and you manage to push away from him and begin to run.  Except now the adrenaline and lingering alcohol has made your legs burn and become unresponsive.

“Helllllllp!” you scream.  “These fags are trying to rape me!”

You are suddenly tackled to the ground by the second man.  “//Fags!?//”  One of your abductor’s hands shoots to your crotch.  “You scared me there for a second!” the man laughs as he roughly plays with your vagina.

//I don’t know how I am going to get out of this…  Oh my god Drew!  Please be the weird, slightly OCD guy I need you to be right now!//

“Did you make it?” reads an unreceived text from Drew.  [[Drew calls you and the call goes to voicemail.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rape2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
“We should go somewhere a bit more...private,” suggests the taller thug.

&quot;I just texted Julie and she said you didn’t come home.  I am worried.  Are you okay, Taylor?” Drew messages you.

“Hnnnnnghh!  Ahhhheeelp!” you yell in vain as you are dragged off to the public toilet men’s room.  You try and fight off your attackers but you are still a bit drunk and hugely outmatched by their strength. 

“Evan isn’t picking up either.  Are you two together?” Drew messages you.
You try and grab your phone out of your pocket but as soon as you do one of the  rapists knocks it to the ground. 

“Noo!  Please!  Why are you doing this to me?” you wail.

The men look at each other and grin.  “Cuz we want to,” the taller one answers as he pushes you down onto the filthy cold tiles of the [[men&#39;s room floor.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="522" name="men&#39;s room floor." tags="" position="6297,13848" size="100,100">Your attackers strip you naked and you can do nothing but unleash a muffled squeal as their hands roughly grope you.  //Ziiiiiip!//  You hear a strange sound and are even more horrified to see that one of the men has zip tied your ankles.  //Noooooo!  I am so fucked!// you despair.  A second later it becomes literally true as one of the thugs thrusts his penis inside you.  He then proceeds to brutally rape you while his cohort plays lookout.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rape.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Haha, this drunk slut loves cock!” the rapists degrades you verbally as well as physically.  Inside your pussy is a stranger’s dick.  //How the fuck did this happen to me?// you wonder.  It almost seems fake, like something happening to another person entirely.  One moment you were fine.  The next you are being raped in a men&#39;s room.

“Yee~ap, she was askin’ fer it!” agrees the other rapist.
The man behind you grabs your arms and suddenly accelerates the pace of his thrusts.  You struggle to stay afoot as his pubes slap against your ass.  Your hair is everywhere.  You feel like you are going nuts.  You want to die, to fight back, and to feel good all at the same time.

Just as you feel the last vestiges of your sanity slipping away, the man raping you cums inside you.  He thrusts half heartedly inside you until his dick is soft and his balls are drained completely.

“My turn!” announces the other man as he takes his place.

“TAYLOR!  Where did you go?” Drew’s messages become frantic.  “Are you okaaay?”

Then a minute later, “Plz respond!” 

A dozen missed calls come in, ten from Drew, [[two from your sister.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="523" name="two from your sister." tags="" position="6440,13894" size="100,100">You watch your phone flash just out of reach.  The small hope of salvation taunts you until one of the men picks it up off the floor hand and casually tosses it into a nearby garbage can.  //Noooooo…..// you despair.  Tears stain your cheeks.  It is only your first time.  It hurts so much.  They are being too rough.  Worst of all, you have no choice in the matter and no option except to detach yourself and endure.

//How the fuck did all this happen?//  You decided to walk home alone.  You turned down Drew.  In a way, you did indeed bring down this whole scenario on yourself.  //But it isn’t my fault...is it?//
&quot;Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiit!  I am cumming!&quot; announces the rapist fucking you.  He groans as he cums inside you.  You feel his penis bulge and tremble inside you as the man deposits his sperm deep inside you.

“Oh fuck...we really got carried away,” notes the second rapist as he withdraws from you bleeding, swollen pussy.

“Fuck I know, it’s this stupid bitch’s fault fer askin’ fer it!” the first rapist blames you.   //I didn’t do anything...//

“We came inside her.  She will tell the cops, Earl.”

“Don’t say muh fuckin’ name!!” explodes the dominate rapist, apparently named Earl.

“FUCK!  I dun goofed, Earl, I am sorry,” his partner apologizes.

“Fucking Christ, Jim.  Now we gotta….//kill her,//” Earl concludes without a note of compassion.  He pulls out a switchblade from his pocket and snaps out the blade.

You struggle to move an inch as the steel approaches your face.  All you manage is a feeble shake of your head as the knife closes in on your jugular. 

You see your life flash before your eyes.  It seems so pathetically short and uneventful you almost want to weep.

“Wait!” the one called Jim suddenly yells, interrupting his partner.

“Wut!?” Earl demands.

“We don’t got to kill ‘er.  Let’s just //keep ‘er// instead!  She smells purty and I always wanted a gal like her.  I will look after her, I promise.”

Earl instantly retracts the knife.  “Fuck that’s a great idea.  We share her though, fifty-fifty!  Git the truck, Jim!”

You blink a few times and wince from the pain.  Your vision is spotty but returning.  Earl notices your recovering and, just as you take a deep breath to scream, he open mouth slaps you [[so hard you lose consciousness.]]

The remnants of your clothes are stripped off and your arms are restrained behind your back.  A disgusting ball bag is placed in your mouth.  You feel utterly helpless and that feeling tears at your manly pride more than anything else.

After hours on your knees, Jim finally appears.  “I won the coin flip so I get you the first night!” Jim announces, sounding joyous.  “Oh don’t be sad, I will be gentle.  I got a dog and a cat too and they are both healthy because I keep great care of ‘em, just like I will for you.  So don’t be scared.”

Jim proceeds to rape you well into the [[wee hours of the night.]]

After explaining that he wouldn’t think twice about killing you if you misbehave, he takes out his wrinkled, foul smelling cock and demands you suck on it.

“Wait are you waiting fer?  A beating?  Get on with it you stupid sow!”
You shoot him baleful glare and find that a pathetic look is all the resistance you can muster against your captor.

“Oh this is going to be fun.  If you so much as touch my dick with your teeth I will break all of them so it never happens again.”

With that horrible threat uttered, Earl thrusts his cock forward.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/kidnapbj.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With no alternative except a beating or death, you take the man’s cock in your mouth.  With a grunt, Earl begins to fuck your face.  His cock knocks the back of your throat repeatedly while you gag and sputter.  Earl seems to enjoy your distress and continues pushing his gross dick iside you until he finally ejaculates and fills your mouth with his salty, acrid cum.  Earl then grabs your jaw and forces your mouth closed while staring you in the eyes.  [[It is obvious what he desires.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="527" name="It is obvious what he desires." tags="" position="6293,14140" size="100,100">//Why is this happening to me?  What the fuck did I ever do to deserve this!?//  You realize every second is just prolonging the awful experience, so you finally just swallow, gulping it down like doing a gross dare.

After you swallow Earl&#39;s cum, you are placed back into isolated darkness.  You retch and gag until you throw up.  Earl&#39;s cum tastes no better the second time around.  You are left alone with only your frantic thoughts.

You remain in the dark for a long time, taken out only to be used by your tormentors.

As the days inexorably tick away, you cannot help but despair and gradually resign yourself to your fate.  At a certain point you stop resisting and start fantasizing.  You switch yourself off and imagine yourself living a life of happiness.  In your dreams you are often rescued, but even they soon morphed into nightmares.

A moment comes when you think you might be able to escape but you are sure it is a test so you do nothing and let the opportunity pass.  

Your holders keep care of you.  Over time, your mind gets twisted and warped.  At some point you become grateful for their care, for the food they bring you and for the stunted affections they offer you.

After the first month of tortuous resistance, you decide it is best to give the impression of submission to bide your time until a new chance to escape appears.  Yet, as time passes, you find your will to watchfully endure gradually diminishes.  Your life becomes so boring that you almost find yourself looking forward to the moments you are taken out and used.  You become numb inside and begin to crave any stimulation that [[might provoke a feeling or distraction.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="528" name="might provoke a feeling or distraction." tags="" position="6425,14200" size="100,100">After a year of daily abuse, you finally break completely.  When your keepers call you a whore fit only for breeding, you now readily agree.  After being called a useless breeding bitch countless times it became impossible not to internalize some of the insults.

“Please cum inside me, Earl!  I want your cum inside me so bad!” you shout at your master as his hot cock ravages your insides and kisses against your cervix.

Earl obliges your request with a grunt, sending blast after blast of hot sperm into the back of your uterus.

Eventually, it seems the law of averages works its magic.  After accepting countless daily sperm depositions deep inside you, your belly finally begins to rise.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taypreggers.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Instead of being disgusted, you find that you are happy that you were finally able to fulfill your purpose.  You aren’t sure which of your keepers is the father.  But you suppose it doesn’t really matter, for you will love the child no matter what.  You hope for a girl so that one day you can both serve the masters side by side.

You know your life is fucked up but your old life has been forgotten and sealed away.  In the end, you are sure you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.  Besides, Earl says it is dangerous to go outside, so you choose to stay where you belong, where you know you will be safe and wanted.

After your daughter is born, you are allowed to remain unsupervised in the kitchen while cooking.  Sometimes you look outside the window and marvel at the strange people walking by outside.  //How foolish and brave they are.//  Occasionally you fight off a small urge to step outside and join them but luckily a deeply ingrained fear keeps you rooted where you are and you are glad to have the protective instinct.

You should be pleased you were chosen.  I have been experimenting on the ignorant fuckers they populate my lecture hall with.  And yes, I have been doing it for years!” Mr.Deter shouts.  “If all the most accomplished scientists cannot see but a glimpse of my genius then what good are those ignorant, unschooled louts that they now call “students?”  These //detestiable creatures//...always on their //fucking phones!!//” rants Mr.Deter.  After grinding his teeth for a moment, he continues, “My so-called students have no value except as test subjects for the most important endeavor in human history!  So, in that sense, their sacrifice is immeasurably valuable,” Deter drawls.  “Sure, I will benefit more than they will, but society’s advancement has always come at the cost of mountains of bloody sacrifice.  The common folk must be squashed between the gears of time and serve as lubrication for the engine of life so that others that will live on and eventually thrive in their place.  There is only one true way forward://cutting through convention with the crimson sword of progress!!//&quot;

//Holy fucking...fuck...//  You are seriously worried about your own safety, and Mr.D’s mental health.  “....Okay then.”  You quickly ask Mr. Deter what the hell he wants from you before he launches into another nutty lecture.

“Data I can get.  I have already run many of the tests, we just need  time for the super computer to analyze the mountain of raw information I have gathered.  I am afraid there is another, more pressing matter.  I need you to get important access codes from my, ahem, //former// partner,” [[he explains.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="530" name="he explains." tags="" position="8774,9605" size="100,100">“Hmm.  Why did you guys break up?” you ask.

Deter scowls at your wording.  “Because he is--”

“Incapable of seeing your true genius?” you finish Mr. Deter’s sentence.

Mr. Deter blinks.  “Did they add psionics to the seven series?  Hmm, I will have to look into that.”  You roll your eyes.  “So, Taylor, do we have a deal?” Mr. D presses you once he regains his composure.

You don’t really see many other options.  You feel like you are close to unravelling the mystery behind your transformation.  

//Forward...with a bloody sword, I guess...//  
 
“If you agree to help me, I swear I will turn you back and make sure you are well compensated for all the //awful// trouble you have had to endure,” Mr. D adds, sweetening the pot.

That was the first non shitty offer you have gotten in a long time.

“Okay I will help...if I can.  Who the fuck is this guy?”

“Your target is currently the Chief Technology Officer for Trans Corp International.”

//That doesn’t sound like an easy target….//  “Wait a sec…Why is it you think that //I// can get this back when you clearly cannot?” you question your professor.

Mr.Deter lets out a fizzled sigh.  “I am an //academic// - and he is a conceited, arrogant, imperialistic asshole who dreams of world domination!”

“That sounds a lot like you, [[to be honest.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="531" name="to be honest." tags="" position="8638,9705" size="100,100">“Oh, no, no, //no!//  You have it all wrong!  I want to a //benevolent// dictator.

The countless others that have tried--they all failed because they lack what I have up here,” Mr. Deter explains while tapping at his temple.

//Wow...//  You are left speechless by his unprovoked and unnecessary explanation.  You were pretty sure before but now you are certain that Mr.Deter is completely insane.  You don’t even want to attempt to unpack that labyrinthian level of insanity or you fear you will be swept up with it as well.

“So, this uh, corporate guy...Where is he?  And how the fuck am I going to get this asshole to give me secret information?  It seems a lot like tackling the fucking president and stealing his nuclear football from his five hundred-god-damned bodyguards!”

Mr. Deter shrugs.  “Yes, the corporate security is quite tight,” he concedes.  “They probably have way more than five hundred guards though.  This corporation employs two hundred thousand people in the US alone.  Mr.  Ferret is responsible for some of his company&#39;s most sensitive labs, equipment, and [[research and development.]]”

“Then what the fuck do you expect--”

Mr. Deter makes a weird gesture with his hand, forestalling your outburst.  “But all men have a weakness and I know what his is.”  Mr. Deter begins to laugh maniacally for...far too long.  You become very creeped out as Deter laughs until his voice becomes hoarse.  You are beginning to get a //really //bad feeling about all this.

“What is his “weakness”?” you finally get the courage to ask, afraid you already might know the answer to this question as well.

Mr.Deter lumbers over to his desk and picks up his phone.  He taps at it a few times and points it in your direction.  You feel your hackles rise.  It is a picture of a young woman that looks astonishing like your sister...//or...me.//  “That is his type.  Hundreds of girls but all the same, like that.  If he sees a pretty brunette like this he //must// have her no matter the cost.  Until he gets bored that is.  Most women sell themselves cheap--because they are whores.  My ex-partner is a compulsive man, driven by strange desires and rationale that is difficult to comprehend for //normal// people.”  

“Uh huh…”  You raise an eyebrow, again unsure whether your teacher is describing himself or his alleged former partner.  The way he uttered the word “normal” makes you quite sure he meant “undesirable.”  You think it is a tad weird Mr. D seems to despise the very people he aims to supposedly save by progressing his insane schemes.

“So what’s this guy’s name?  Where does he live?  And the fuck am I supposed to trust you when you are literally doing unethical experiments on your students [[without consent?]]”

He can be often be found on the prowl during lunch hours.  He is usually in one of those shops on Candy Lane, he doesn’t miss a chance to ogle women and search for those that fit his //criteria//...women like //you.//”

“Fucking wow…”  Every single time you think your life has maxed out on how fucked up it can get, you seem to able to make new records shortly thereafter.

“And in regards to your other question: of course you can trust me, I am a //teacher//.  I am an educator, scientist, and visionary - who could be more trustworthy than I?  I am also the only option you’ve got.  If you don’t help me I’d bet the world you stay like that for the rest of your life.  All I need is Lucas&#39; cellphone.  Are you going help me get it or not?”

//Did he just casually bet the world?  Fucking how… he really believes he owns this entire planet and everyone on it.  What a nutcase!  Fuck...what am I going to do now?//  Deter is right, you don’t really seem to have much of a choice.  Still, maybe you could use knowledge of Mr.Deter’s transgressions as leverage against him and find some other way out.

“I will help you.  But I expect you to honor your side of the damned deal!”

“Of course.”

“So you just want me to go up and talk to this Ferret guy?”

“No, I want you to get his phone.  I will leave the specifics up to you.  Just get me his damned cellphone.  Do whatever is necessary; without it we are both screwed.”

You sigh and glance at a nearby clock.  Candy Lane is on the other side of town and it is already three in the afternoon.  //I guess that means I have to wait...//

“I will see what I can do tomorrow,” you inform Deter.

“That’s fine.  Just make sure you show up in class in the morning.  I have this fascinating lecture on…”

You find yourself drawn to Drew’s hand.  With his mother gone, you take it in her place.

	“It’s okay, Drew!” you tell your friend while gently squeezing his hand.  You mentally repeat your words, knowing they are meant for yourself just as much as your friend.
	
“Please don’t fucking die!  You //can’t// die!  I don’t know what I would do without you.”  You place both of your hands over top of Drew’s and then lay your head on top.  You close your eyes silently praying that Drew miraculously recovers.

A short time later, you wake up to a subtle movement in Drew’s hand.  //His hand is moving!//  You grab it and squeeze Drew’s hand tightly, willing him to wake up. //Please fucking live!//

To your astonishment and absolute joy, Drew opens his eyes.

&quot;Drew!&quot;

With a bout of wet coughing, Drew removes his oxygen mask.  Drew looks at you through swollen eyelids and you feel your stomach cinch into knots.  You have dreaded this moment.  You are sure Drew is going to be furious at you and that your friendship is over, but yet when Drew looks at you it is obvious he holds no grudge.  In fact, the opposite seems true, for it is clear Drew’s first reaction on seeing you is one of relief.  “Taylor,” Drew says to you, his voice a scratchy whisper.  “//I am so glad you’re okay.//”

His selfless words nearly make you cry.  “You dummy...you should focus on yourself.”

“Ahh...yeah….I...definitely got a few pains,” he stoically replies [[through gritted teeth.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="537" name="through gritted teeth." tags="" position="6886,15601" size="100,100">Knowing that Drew is going to survive removes a hundred pounds of mental weight from your shoulders.  “Oh thank fuck you’re alive!” you cheer.  You barely resist the urge to bear hug him.  “Drew, for a bit there I thought you were going to die!”  you say as you wipe your tears away with the back of your arm.   “Thank you, Drew.  You saved me...again.  I honestly don’t even know what to say...or how I could ever thank you properly.”

Drew makes a weird wheezing noise you take for a laugh.  “Taylor, I don’t want anything from you.  I am just happy you are safe.”

His earnestness ties the knot in your stomach even tighter.  “Ughh…  You’re a real life white-knight aren’t you?”

Drew starts to laugh but quickly stops and then winces in pain.

You shake your head at Drew.  His heroism seems so...//strange.//  Sure, Drew is plenty heroic- in video games…   //The white knights only get the princess in fairy tales.//  Meanwhile, in real life, you seldom noticed such “good guys” to be very successful with women.  As you look at Drew’s smiling, battered face, you have a painful thought.  There is probably not a single woman alive that knows how truly awesome he is except for his mother...and maybe //you.//

As you inspect Drew’s swollen face, a number of emotions and thoughts whirl through your maelstrom of a mind.  You feel guilty, ashamed, and angry...but within all of those feelings you also were undeniably proud of Drew and his actions.  You were impressed with his bravery and stubbornness.  //Drew is an awesome guy,// you realize.  You very much doubt you will ever find a friend as dedicated and loyal as Drew.  //And look what his loyalty got him!//  You are mad at yourself more than anything, but you find you can’t even focus your anger properly, as Drew smiles up at you, glad you don’t a single scratch on you.  You wish your positions could be reversed, but such a mental exercise does nothing productive except make you feel even worse.

“Drew, you are awesome…”  

You resolve to live in the moment.  You figure that life is far too short to lie to yourself and others.  Whether you return to your old form or not is somewhat immaterial because in the end you still have to live your life in a positive manner.  You are only alive right now because of Drew.  Maybe there was a way you could give Drew a bit of [[pleasure to balance out his pain]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="538" name="pleasure to balance out his pain" tags="" position="6743,15699" size="100,100">You go lock the door to Drew’s hospital room and creep back to his bed.

“What are you doing?” Drew asks you as slide your hand under his covers.
You sniff.  “The only thing I can,” you answer as you pull Drew’s pants down and set to work on your friend’s cock and balls.

“Uh!  Oh!”  

“Careful, keep your neck straight if you want to walk again!” you advise him.
Drew’s eyes go even wider and then wider still as you begin to rapidly jerk off his cock.

“Oh my god...Taylor!  Why are you doing this?”

You sigh.  “Because I know how you feel about me.  You’re hurting so much because of me...in more ways than one...I just want to take away a little bit of your pain if I can.  I am not a doctor...this is the only thing I can think of.”

You look at Drew’s twitching cock.  A part of you had already decided to suck on Drew’s penis, but when you see it up close you have second thoughts.  The overall weirdness of the scenario gives you pause.  The strange feeling of the soft, springy flesh of your friend’s penis in hand...it’s odd, slightly sour odor assaulting your nostrils reminds you of how fucked up the situations is. As Drew hardens in your hand, your urge to continue disappears.

“Uaghhh!”  //Did Drew stop and think about helping me?  No, he just saw a problem and dealt with it, without any thought to his own personal health, safety, or comfort.//  You now see a very hard and very solvable problem in front of you.  //Just fucking do it!  For Drew!// you mentally chant as your hand increases the intensity of its strokes while you climb on to the bed and [[reposition yourself between Drew’s legs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="539" name="reposition yourself between Drew’s legs." tags="" position="6885,15755" size="100,100">“Ow...Taylor…Oh!” Drew moans.  You cannot tell if it is due to pain or pleasure or a combination.  You do your best to increase the pleasure side of that equation.

You are capable of helping your friend and ease some of his pain in this small way.  You close your eyes and move closer to your friend’s petrified member.  When you open your eyes again, your lips are mere inches from Drew’s erection.  From his locked sitting position, Drew watches your actions with bulging eyes.

You summon every iota of your courage.  Moving forward now seems horrifying but necessary.  Backing out now it would be almost as embarrassing as continuing.  It is something so easy, so simple, and yet you find this to be one of the most difficult actions of your life.  Your sober mind throws hundreds of objections at you but you silence them all as you feel your internal monologue get torn apart.  You are going to suck Drew’s dick.   //C’mon, Taylor!  Just fucking do it!// you urge yourself forward, and your lips finally touch Drew’s cock.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockkiss3.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
//Ughh!  What do I even do?//  You decide to start by giving Drew’s penis a kiss.  You are immediately thankful that Drew’s dick is very clean.  It has a very faint odor [[but it is far from offensive.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="540" name="but it is far from offensive." tags="" position="6745,15857" size="100,100">You keep kissing Drew’s glans until it is weeping precum.  The salty taste on your tongue intensifies.  You can tell from your own personal experiences that Drew’s cock is about to explode.  //Err...what should I do?//  You have already tasted Drew’s cum before… You recall your awful moment in his bathroom, your walk home with his seed staining you, Drew’s full wastebaskets, his howl of bliss, “~Taaaaaaaaaylor!”

The memories just serve to amplify your confusion.  //Oh my god I am sucking a dick!  Drew’s dick!//  

“Uhhh…UHHH!” Drew moans louder and louder.  He clearly aims to cum in your mouth if it is still present in the vicinity of his pulsating dick.  Your masculine mind yells at you to move away, to at least avoid the final, disgusting indignity of willingly accepting your friend’s cum in your mouth. 

Yet when you look up at Drew and lock eyes with him, his face twisted into a characterture of pleasure, you just keep going, unwilling to spoil his bliss.  You keep sucking and licking, stubbornly refusing to stop as your friend’s waist begins to shudder.  You let your best friend ejaculate in your mouth.  You give Drew another few soft pumps and then allow his hot cum to shoot inside and then spill out of your mouth. 

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/drewbj.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You get more than enough of Drew’s gross tasting cum to last a million lifetimes.  Luckily most of it drips out of your mouth and you avoid swallowing any, although you get a good taste of the foul reproductive liquid.  //Fuck how many times have I touched Drew’s cum now?  Eww….//  Still, your discomfort is a small price to pay for Drew’s happiness.  For what he did for you today, you would do almost anything to repay that debt.  The fact that Drew wanted nothing in return just made you want to repay him that much more.  Once Drew is finished, you use tissues to clean yourself and Drew up.  You delicately dab around Drew’s softening cock and then toss the soiled wad into a nearby waste basket.

You are suddenly alarmed by [[loud knocking on the door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="541" name="loud knocking on the door." tags="" position="6889,15903" size="100,100">“Oh fuck!”  //Mrs. Drachmann is back!//  You scramble to the door and let her in.  She gives you a very weird, all-knowing look.  You  feel yourself blush so fiercely you fear spontaneous combustion.  You flee out into the hall.  “Drew!  You’re awake!  I brought you dinner but it turned out you needed a maiden’s kiss to wake you up!  I didn’t know you had a girlfriend!  She is so pretty!  Why didn’t you tell me!?” You hear Mrs. Drachmann begin an inquisition and you cannot help but cringe and leave Drew to finish his interrogation.

//Drew’s girlfriend!?//  The idea leaves you feeling anxious.  You momentarily imagine yourself as Drew’s girlfriend and stop cold when the idea doesn’t provoke laughter.  “Drew’s girlfriend?  What the fuck?  I don’t want to be Drew’s -//anyone’s// girlfriend.”  //Fuck.  I feel so mixed up.  I just fucking sucked a //dick!  Drew’s// dick.//  The scariest part about the thought, is that the idea of being Drew’s girlfriend is not //entirely// revolting to you.

“I think I am actually going crazy….”  //Or not!  There are literal men in black out to get me!//  “Or maybe I am just fucking nuts…Fuck...probably a bit of both...” you say as you turn a corner and run into a familiar looking man.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/suspiciousman.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Holy fuck!”  //Of course the hospital isn’t safe!  I need to get the hell out of here.  Now!//

“Wait!  I just want to talk!  //Stop!//” the man orders you as you take off [[bolting through the hospital.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="542" name="bolting through the hospital." tags="" position="6741,16005" size="100,100">//Yeah, fucking right!  You just put my friend in the hospital, you prick!  Your intentions are clearly malevolent!//  You vault over a gurney and dash through a set of security doors.  After a couple of lucky turns, you are outside the building.

You consider hiding at Evan’s or going to a hotel, but eventually you decide to go home.  //As far as I know it is just one guy...maybe I can ask Julie for a taser or some self defense tips.//

“Hmm...Shit!  Why would one guy have an earpiece though?”  Clearly the man in the suit was working with others.  The violent approach makes you fairly certain the man you saw was not a member of the FBI.

//At least Drew is safe.  Since this guy is targeting me I should lead him away from the hospital.//

	You manage to sneak home and lock yourself safely inside.  Once the door is bolted shut, you feel a lot safer.
	
	The next day you skip class and skulk out in your room, shooting frequent paranoid glances between the blinds to search for men in black suits that might be watching you.  Although you check…[[hundreds of times.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="543" name="hundreds of times." tags="" position="6885,16047" size="100,100">Cooped up and stressed out, you do what any young adult would: you masturbate.  A lot.

You try and relax and draw yourself a hot bath.  As you immerse yourself into the warm water, you feel the tension of your muscles lesson.

It doesn’t take long before your hands wander and your are stroking your underwater pussy.

“Ohh….” you moan as your hand sets to work on pleasing you.  It isn’t long before the rush of an orgasm washes over you.

You keep rubbing yourself, losing yourself in distractions of the flesh.  Soon, you feel the water begin to cool off.  As you reach to turn on the hot water, you are suddenly struck with a genius idea.  You pull the plug and drain off some water before returning the plug.  With a lewd smile, you turn on and adjust the water and then slide your pussy directly under the faucet.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bathfaucet.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Hnnnnnnnghhh!  Ohhh!”  You begin to run delicate circles over your clit while the warm water washes over your genitals.  It isn’t long before your movements become rough and the pace of your swirling fingers accelerates until you are left splashing unintentionally as your legs spasm and you lie back into the warm water’s embrace.

Being a woman was definitely fucked up but your new form did have its [[pleasurable advantages.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="544" name="pleasurable advantages." tags="" position="6745,16157" size="100,100">The next day you hide out in your house until hunger drives you to ransack your bare cupboards.

“Damnit!  Julie ate my Lucky Os!  What a bitch.  Ahhhhhhh!  I am starving.” 

//I won’t let the men in black keep me under siege!  If they are going to come, there is nothing I can do to prevent it.  Better to be assassinated with a bag of chips in hand than without,// you morbidly muse.

After peeking outside and casting suspicious glances in all directions, you decide the coast appears clear.  You dash to the grocery store and manage to keep your paranoia in check long enough to buy some snacks and return most of the way home.  [[No men in black appear to block your path.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="545" name="No men in black appear to block your path." tags="" position="6885,16187" size="100,100">You daydream as you walk, suddenly interrupted by yelling.

“Fred you bastard!  Why are you staring at that ugly flat chick!?” a woman loudly scolds her boyfriend.  //Ugly...flat chick…?//  You are the only other person within sight.  You look down at your breasts.  They always seemed huge to you.  //But I guess that is compared to my old chest...Maybe B’s are a little low on the boob-power scale,// you concede.  

“Fuck!  Why am I even thinking about this?  I should be pissed that creep was even looking at me.”  Yet you aren’t...at least not completely.  You are annoyed but also a bit //flattered//.  “I don’t give a fuck!” you shout.

Yet you find that you do.  The &quot;flat&quot; comment sticks with you and you mutter about it on your way home.  “Stupid, shallow cunt.  I know that fat cow was just being jealous of my trim figure...but…”  Maybe she did have a point.  

After showering, you look at your modest B-cup breasts.  They are perky and round, a pair of truly flawless boobs. They had once felt weird, like foreign intruders invading your personal space.  Yet now they feel like they are just another one of your body parts. 

You catch yourself staring narcissitically into your reflection.  You know that you’re a total fox but still...you had always preferred larger chests on women.  You feel a bit weird that you still possess the desire.  Still, you suppose it is probably just a natural evolution.  The longer you stay in this body, the more you will likely desire to look your best and feel comfortable.  //I am a babe...but I would be a super-babe if I were a C...or maybe even a D…//  You cup your breasts and try and stick out your chest in an effort to make your breasts look more prominent and fleshy.

“I look great but… once size up would be optimal.  C-cups are the best!” you [[opine to your reflection.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="546" name="opine to your reflection." tags="mirror-epiphany" position="6745,16309" size="100,100">You stare deeper into your reflection.  Your too-beautiful reflection stars back at you until your eyes lower to your breasts.

“The Bs and are cute and I appreciate the lack of burden but Cs would definitely suit this body...me… a lot better.”

You lose yourself in your symmetrical, perky breasts.  //They are close to perfect but just not quite there….//

You wonder what you would look like if you were just a single size larger.  //Just one size up would be perfect,// you repeat the thought.  You zone out while staring at your reflected boobs, while silently wishing they were just slightly larger.

You suddenly feel a strange warmth emenate from your niples downward.  At first it is painless but that quickly changes.  A deep, dull, ache begins to radiate from deep inside your chest and when the two sensations meet, you feel like your chest has been set on fire.  The pain quickly recedes before returning again.  Your breasts begin to ache and swell as if your chest has been stung by bees...//a lot// of bees.  The skin on your chest turns red and bubbly, [[swelling like a bad allergic reaction.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="547" name="swelling like a bad allergic reaction." tags="" position="6885,16355" size="100,100">“Ow, what the fuck?”  Your chest starts to heat up until your entire chest is beet red.  Just when you are about to call 911, the sensation abruptly ceases and a cold, numb chill sweeps over the affected area.

Your mouth falls open in shock as your eyes glance to the mirror.

It is pretty obvious you have undergone a minor transformation.  Your breasts appear to have enlarged a full size.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wtfccup.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“What the fuck?!”

You grope your breasts.  It is clearly not an optical illusion.  //This is impossible!// your mind protests but your groping hands confirm the transformation’s authenticity. 

“I can change my breast size,” you say the words, half statement half question.  Compared to your initial transformation, the change is minor...but it shocks and amazes you that such a thing is even possible in the first place.

//If I can fucking magically change into a girl, and go from pecs to breasts...I guess I can’t really be too shocked if I go up a size.//

As you are looking down at your newly swollen breasts, suddenly:
[[A brilliant idea comes into your head]]
[[You decide you want them even larger]]
[[You decide to stay with the Cs]]
[[You have regrets and want to go back to your natural Bs]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="548" name="A brilliant idea comes into your head" tags="" position="6744,16445" size="100,100">You suddenly get a brilliant idea.  Countless neurons trigger at once, coalescing into a thought lightning bolt that powers your metaphorical mental lightbulb until it lights up your room...and your smile.

“Hollllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy fffffffuuuuuuuuuucccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggggg shit!”

You begin talking to your reflection.  “If I can change my boob size...can I?”

//Yes, yes!  YES!!  Yes, I fucking can!  I am fucking free!//  A sweeping feeling of elation washes over you.  You suddenly desire blue eyes instead of brown, you want them to be blue so desperately, you repeat the thoughts in a loop, trying to make it your utmost desire.  //Blue...blue...blue...BLUE!// you think, praying that your body will respond to your request.

Like a magic trick, your irises slowly fade, turning bright blue from their natural autumn since birth.

“No...fucking way!”

//I can transform into….FUCKING ANYTHING!//  There were probably limits, but in that moment you felt like you suddenly had none.
“Sweet-merciful-fucking-Christ!”  

“I--I I...I could be...//anyone//…” //Or at least look like them.//
“Oh-my-gooood!  Can I transform myself back into a man by just willing it!?”  //I am a fucking genius!//  You feel like you have just unlocked the cheat codes for life.  Perhaps you have.

“Alright, Taylor!  Man up!” you yell at yourself in the mirror. 
You repeat your mental experiment, this time desiring to become a man.  //I want my dick back!//

You focus all of your pent up anger along with your desire to return to the way you were before into a single focal point in your mind.  You push your desire into it until it is a swirling maelstrom, a black hole fatally engulfing anything it touches.

“Yessss!” you howl in exultation as you feel your body swell and grow slightly taller.  Every muscle in your body bulges and spasms, seeming to grow larger and more firm.  You feel like you are doing a bench press and just struggling to complete the final rep.

//[[It is happening!  I am doing it!]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="549" name="You decide you want them even larger" tags="" position="7034,16697" size="100,100">“Fucking hell!  These things are...huge!”  As you look down you feel terribly conflicted.  You are amazed, slightly terrified, and very turned on all at the same time.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fempovbottom.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“This is… unbelievable…”

You had always admired large chests on women...but now you are a woman and it is your fucking chest.  You shake your head and pinch yourself but your transformation is apparently not a weird dream.

You now feel tired but keep pressing on until your body is dripping sweat.  “Just...a ...little….bit more!” you claw out the words as you struggle to keep your transformation progressing.  You send a shaking hand to your crotch, praying for at least a hint of a penis reforming, but instead you feel only muscular thighs and a familar soft cleft.  //Damn it!//  You feel your desire waver slightly and then your confidence cracks and soon you can feel the warmth of the transformation cease.  You feel yourself fall far short of your manly objective.

“I think I could do it...maybe…”  //With training or some kind of aid...//  It was exhausting but you had succeeded in altering your body.  You walk to the washroom and look at the mirror.  You look significantly more muscular.  You have toned abs and muscles, while your shoulders are much larger.  Even your enlarged breasts now seem more taut and firm.

It gives you a headache, but you perform a few more tests in the mirror.  It seems that minor variations like hair, nail, and eye color were simple to pull off with minimal strain.

You sit down on the bed and try and relax.

“Fuck...I am still stuck in a woman’s body…”  //Damn...nothing has changed really except maybe I could pose as a blonde for a day...//  Aside from some obviously perverted stuff, you find your monumental discovery was perhaps not as impactful as you may have first believed.

“God damnit!  I was so fucking close!”  For a minute there, you were certain your sex was just a mental decision instead of a physical reality.  //Still, maybe that line of thought isn’t that far off...I am definitely on to something here though!//

[[Mess around with some new transformations]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="553" name="your new body is playing tricks upon your mind." tags="" position="2796,16294" size="100,100">You step into the shower and start with cold water that shocks you back into a sense of sanity.  You wash your hair and do your best to clean your vagina.  You have no idea how to do it effectively, but through some gently probing with hot water and a finger you eventually feel clean.  You are definitely going to have to speak to Evan.  Having his cum inside you is not only insanely gross it is also //irresponsible// and not in a cool, fun way.

As you step out of the bathroom wearing only a towel, Evan eagerly sits up.  “Are you all clean?  Believe me, I am ready to //feast.//”  
“Ugh.  Please don’t talk about devouring my genitals.  It is super fucking weird.”

Evan goes to pounce on you but you stop him with some stern words.  “Evan!  I am not going to touch you unless you go shower.  You’re all sweaty and gross.”

Evan looks mystified.  “B-but we are just going to get all sweaty and gross anyway…”

“So the fuck what?  You stink, so go shower.  Don’t give me any bullshit either.  Just because you are going to get dirty again doesn’t mean you forego basic hygiene.  Besides maybe you need to clean up any accidental leaks the bear may have caused.”

“Hah.  That bear nearly shit itself.  My shorts, on the other hand, are clean!” Evan brags.

“Well, Mr. Clean-Shorts, go fucking shower.  And hurry up,” you say while wiggling in your towel.

“I am just going to rinse, I will be right out.”

A minute later, Evan [[returns naked and dripping from the shower]].  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="554" name="returns naked and dripping from the shower" tags="" position="2648,16396" size="100,100">You let your towel fall to the ground with a sigh.  You feel his hot breath against your wet vagina.  Evan begins to enthusiastically eat you out.  He then lightly nibbles at your labia, gently pulling apart your lips with his teeth.  

“Oh, fuck!  Evan...that feels so good…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evaneat.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
He rubs his wet finger on your asshole as you cum, his shaking digit working like a targeted vibrator.  It isn’t long before you cannot resist his erotic assault.  //Is...he improving?//  The idea of your perverted friend practicing sex stuff on you in order to refine his craft is pretty damn weird.  As Evan brings you to oblivion and back, you cannot help but wonder how good of a lover Evan could become after a few more months of practice.

//Fuck...am I really going to be like this in a few months?  I hope not but...maybe that [[wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="555" name="wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world." tags="" position="2796,16446" size="100,100">Evan makes you cum a second time and you lock your legs around his head as you grind your sodden pussy against your friend’s face.

When you finally release him Evan stands up and thrusts his waiting erection forward.  You are now more than familiar with this process, so you set to work.  You stroke his meaty shaft while kissing and tonguing Evan’s glans.  Instead of focusing on your embarrassment, you focus only on pleasuring the cock in front of you.  //Evan’s cock...Mmmm...//  He had already made you cum twice and saved you from a fucking bear, the least you could do would be to return a portion of the favour.  Soon your tongue, hands, and lips bring Evan to his limit.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocksuck8.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Oh my god, I am about to blow!  [[I am going to cum on your face!” Evan announces.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="556" name="I am going to cum on your face!” Evan announces." tags="" position="2652,16548" size="100,100">“No, fucking don’t!  I //just had a fucking shower!//” you protest in vain as Evan covers your face in his fishy white cream.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/cumtasting.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ohh….” Evan moans as he jerks off the last few remnants of his ejaculation onto the soft, white skin of your cheeks..

You give Evan a dirty look but he just grins stupidly back at you.  You sigh in defeat.  You’ve had Evan’s cum on you so many times by now it has long ceased to bother you very much.  The cum just feels like nothing, just a faint wetness on your face.  It stinks really badly and forces a cleanup but, based on the enjoyment Evan seems to get from it, it is probably worth a minute at the sink and a bit of discomfort.  You know you should hate giving head but you find that thought to be untrue.  Sure, it was kind of gross...but it was also sort of fun...and very sexy.  //I enjoy sucking dick...Wow….call the men in the white coats!//  Evan’s dick turns you on, even though there is always a tiny nagging voice at the back of your mind that reminds you that you are a man and that the whole scenario is incredibly wrong.  Yet over all, you can’t help but conclude that sucking your friend’s penis isn’t a big deal, more a momentary annoyance than anything else.  And if it led to reciprocal pleasures?  [[Then so be it.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="557" name="Then so be it." tags="" position="2456,16854" size="100,100">Evan grabs your hand and you let him pull you into the bedroom.  Once inside, Evan pushes you gently down onto the bed.  You look at Evan’s eager stare and bobbing erection and momentarily consider your own desires before you give in.  You open your legs and spread your tight, pink pussy for your best friend.  Evan doesn’t need a second invitation and climbs on top of you in a flash.  “I can’t wait any longer!” Evan complains as he jerks his hard cock and slowly presses against your soaked entrance.

“I can’t either…” you admit.  Evan takes your admission as acceptance and pushes his huge dick all the way inside of you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evanenjoy.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Each time he thrusts into you, you feel yourself slip away until you feel like you are floating.  //Uhnn…..sex feels so good...//  It isn’t long before your toes are curling and your fingers find themselves tightly grasping at the bed sheets.  You feel so warm, sexy, and alive.  Evan begins to breath raggedly, matching your own gasping.  As Evan pumps his cock deep inside you, his face gradually gets drawn closer to your own.  Pretty soon you are fucking each other while looking into each other’s eyes.  You can feel Evan’s hot breath on your lips and your own orgasm beckoning.

“Uhh!  Uhh...Evan…”

“Taylor!  I am going to..to…”

In your moment of ultimate bliss, your eyes focus on your friend&#39;s lips.  You:
[[Kiss Evan...]]
[[Resist the temptation.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="558" name="Kiss Evan..." tags="" position="2592,16888" size="100,100">A fit of spontaneous madness seizes you as you close your eyes and kiss Evan.  Evan immediately kisses you back, filling your mouth with his roaming tongue just as you finally come.

“Mmmmmmmmppphgggggggh!!!  Mhmmmmmmmmmmm……...mmmmmmmm…..” you moan as you convulse and shiver while being pounded by Evan.  You have never orgasmed with a penis and a tongue inside you.  The complementary sensations, the softness and hardness together, overwhelms you in a way you never thought possible.

Evan keeps making out with you until you are both sweaty and satisfied.  Evan continues to jackhammer his penis inside you until, with one last balls-deep thrust, and a throaty groan, he ejaculates deep inside you.  After Evan cums, he rolls off you and plants a kiss on your sweaty forehead.

You can feel Evan staring at you so you you turn your head to look at him.  “Taylor, you’re my dream girl,” Evan confides in you.  He says the words so bluntly they seem to [[smack you in the face.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="559" name="Resist the temptation." tags="" position="2303,16893" size="100,100">Can Taylor resist?  Find out next time!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="560" name="smack you in the face." tags="" position="2456,16998" size="100,100">“What!?”

“You heard me.  You’re perfect.  How can I not pursue you?”

“I am not your dream girl!  I am not even a real girl!” you flatly respond but you note the protest sounds hollow even to your own ears.  “And I am obviously not perfect...what the fuck?”

“But you look like it,” Evan eagerly replies while looking you dead in the eyes.  “I mean, uh, you’re female.  When I look at you that’s all I see.   A woman.  A //beautiful// woman.”  Apparently appearances trump the rest of the baggage, at least in Evan’s book. 

//Fucking men//, you mentally curse as you recall your own experiences.  For a second you wonder if this is how men get “tricked” by traps.  Men were visual creatures and once aroused satisfying their urges became more important than any mental baggage.  Any additional taboo probably only served to encourage them.

“But it is more than just how you look.  I think you are--”

“Evan, please don’t say another damn word.”

“Just think about it.  We are great together.  Maybe all this crazy shit...maybe everything was just...//fate//.”

“But it is so weird!”  //And fate?  Are you fucking kidding me?//

“So what?  Weird things become normal eventually,” Evan rationalizes.  [[You regret not having ear plugs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="561" name="You regret not having ear plugs." tags="" position="2596,17036" size="100,100">You sigh.  Your relationship with Evan is kind of gross...but you suppose it isn’t that big of deal.  You have already had sex, so repeating the act seems to hold less consequences.

“Ready for another round?” Evan asks you.  You are shocked to see his member has already rejuvenated itself.  You see Evan’s cock is at full attention.  You look at the towering, girthy member, a monument to manhood you could have never matched.  Yet now, instead of male jealousy you are crushed by female desire.

“Ughh….Fuck!”  //I want it inside me so bad!//  “Okay…” you whisper to Evan.  You can feel your already flushed cheeks heat up even further.  “I am ready.”

“Fuck yes, Taylor!” Evan cheers as he thrusts back inside you, looking like a kid with a hundred bucks to spend at a candy store.

You watch with amazement as Evan’s huge cock repeatedly buries itself inside you.  //So deep...Uhn…  My belly...ughh…  I am getting fucked by Evan’s dick!  I can’t believe I am taking the whole thing!//  Yet you are.  And not only that, but you are also enjoying the act…[[far too much, you worry.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="562" name="far too much, you worry." tags="" position="2456,17142" size="100,100">Your bodies began to collide as the pace of your fucking intensifies, both of you seeking greater pleasures from each other’s flesh.  Evan’s hands grab your light body and, with a hand on each of your ass cheeks, he proceeds to fuck you like you have never been fucked before.

“Ohh….” you moan in protest as Evan withdraws.  You feel an insatiable desire to be refilled.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bigcockwithdrawl.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
With a single thrust Evan pierces you to your deepest limit.  “Uhnnnggh!”  The sound leaves your lips unbidden, a horrible utterance, part surprised grunt of pain part moan, sounding even more alien because it resounds about the room in [[your new feminine voice.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="563" name="your new feminine voice." tags="" position="2592,17184" size="100,100">“Fuck I love watching your tits bounce around as I fuck you.”  You ignore Evan and focus on the pleasure of your joined genitals.  You feel like you a riding a horse...a lovely, pleasurably horse.
//Ugh...except I am riding EVAN and not a horse...And this feels soooo much better….//

You cum hard yet again.  As the orgasm surges through your extremities and you look at your twitching toes, a moment of blissful clarity settles over you.  The feeling is so intense, your breasts are still heaving on your chest as your recover your breath.  For the first time in a ages, you feel //genuinely happy.//  The more disturbing conclusion, linked to the first, is that you are glad to have this body.  Lucky even.  Your new body was attractive and capable of a level of pleasure so remarkable that it shook your very concept of self to its core.

The strange tingle inside you intensifies into a burning, overwhelming desire.
“Just state what you desire plainly and I will oblige.”
“I-I-I.”
“Just be honest with yourself.  What do you want right now?”
“I want…” you manage to say but find yourself too conflicted to finish.  The part of you that was once a man is screaming madly at you.  //This is fucked up.  This is wrong!  Stop this now before it goes too far.//
Your eyes focus on Evan’s cock.  Your friend studies your features and chuckles, beginning to jerk off his cock, placing its head [[just out of reach of your overflowing pussy.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="564" name="just out of reach of your overflowing pussy." tags="" position="2456,17286" size="100,100">//This feels so good it is driving me insane!

Uhhhnn.”  Your partner begins to hit you with rapid, shallow strokes that soon drive you over the edge, sending you convulsing into one of the most intense orgasm of your life.

As you lie in the afterglow, you feel a part of yourself slip away into the void.  “Cock feels so good inside me…” you mutter.

“It felt great to be inside you...the way you grip me...uhhh,” Evan says with a sigh of relief.

You ignore him, lost in your own little world.  

“Cock...cock...I...I...love it,” you quietly murmur.  The admission makes you uncomfortable, but at the same time you feel relieved, like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.  Cocks arouse you.  Having one fuck you gets you off.  And the cock that gets you off the most…[[belongs to your best fucking friend.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="565" name="belongs to your best fucking friend." tags="" position="2592,17344" size="100,100">After a night spent in Evan’s arms, you wake up feeling surprisingly spry.

It takes you a few hours to clean and pack up.  You are soon back on the road, heading back to civilization.  Your weekend was certainly stimulating.  Despite your earlier reservations, you don’t even regret coming on the trip.

After an hour of driving, the two of you stop for an ice cream.

Once back in the vehicle. Evan devours his entire three scoop cone in under thirty seconds.  You stare at him with disbelief.  

“Did you even taste that?” you ask your friend, bewildered.  You decide to ignore Evan’s lack of discipline and [[focus on the enjoyment of your own treat.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="566" name="Go home and chat with Julie." tags="" position="12245,20694" size="100,100">“Heeeey~ Taaaylor!” Julie welcomes you home as soon as you step through the door.  Her eagerness immediately puts you on guard.

“What do you want?”

“I want to help you!”

“No, no, NO!  I have a very clear memory of what happened last time!”

“You turned out so pretty!”

You sigh in exasperation.  It is probably best to just let Julie play dress-up for a bit and then avoid her in the future rather than having a big fight in the hallway.

“Just be gentle,” you half-jokingly request.

“Oh I will!”

“And nothing weird please!”

“No promises!”

[[Let Julie &quot;help&quot; you again]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="567" name="We aren’t done yet, Taylor" tags="" position="12244,20851" size="100,100">“Yes, we are!” you yell back.

“No, we aren’t!” your sister counters, her unblinking brown eyes lock you into a staring contest that you inevitably lose.  

You sit back in the chair, wishing you could be anywhere else.  “Oh god what are you going to do to me now?”

“I am going to braid your hair!”

“No...can you just please //not// do this?”

“No, sorry.  As your sister, I have a duty to make sure my new sister is as pretty as she can be.”

“I am not your sist--Ow!  Stop tugging!”

“It is //necessary.//  Now shut up and let me work.  And pay attention!” she chides you with a light smack.  “This is how you braid hair.  First you take two strands and then wrap it over like so…”  Your sister begins to weave your hair together into small pigtails.

Twenty minutes later, you look like an entirely different person.

“Oh-my-god!  I should work in the beauty industry!  You turned out so cute!” your sister gushes.  You look in the mirror and then [[admire yourself.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="568" name="back into the safety of your room." tags="" position="12985,18804" size="100,100">The next day you feel sick so you decide to skip class.  You obsess over Mitch’s threats until it is finally time to meet him.  Seeing no alternative, you stiffly walk down a familiar, dark road.   Your legs feel heavy as you climb the last few steps to Mitch’s apartment.

You pause at the door and don’t knock but Mitch opens it anyway, as if he was clearly expecting you.  It annoys you so much that Mitch knew before you did what your decision would be.

“Hey, Taylor!  Tonight is all about a lesson.  The breaks between our visits were just too long.  Even though you //think// I am trying to force you, the real truth is I am actually doing you a favor.  You and I both know that.”

“You’re a really sick guy, Mitch.  You need //serious// help.”

Mitch chuckles.  “It actually is the other way around.  You’re the one in the shit position.  How about I lend you a hand...or a dick?”

“Will raping me make you feel better?”

“Of course!  But this isn’t rape because, as the old saying goes: “You can’t rape the willing.” Am I right, Taylor?”  You bury your head in your hands in a moment of awful introspection.  “Now get naked and let’s see that ass.”

You fight back tears as you strip in front of your childhood bully.  Your miserable expression only seems to please Mitch.  “Here, don’t worry… I look out for my sluts!” Mitch says as he pushes forward a small pile of cocaine stacked on top of a business card [[and offers it to you.]]  

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="569" name="and offers it to you." tags="" position="13141,18846" size="100,100">You immediately perk up at the sight, even though you despise the level of power Mitch commands over you.

You try and resist the urge to snort the powder but you find your willpower only buys you about a second.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taybump.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
//Snnnnnnnnnnnnnnnniiifffff!//  Your outlook on life reverses as your favourite feeling of confident euphoria washes over you.

Soon you are in a familiar position, [[face down, ass up.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="570" name="face down, ass up." tags="" position="12989,18944" size="100,100">The first thing Mitch does is start fingering your asshole.

“Ahhh!  What the fuck are you doing!?”

“Tonight I am going to make a point and drive it home.  If I fuck you in your puss, you will just enjoy it too much.  So, until you beg me to fuck you properly, I am going to ravage your tight asshole.”

‘No!  //Please!//  It //really// fucking hurt last time!”

Mitch laughs hard.  “And?  That is only making me want to do it to you even more!”

“Noooooooogggggggghhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” you screech and wail as Mitch tears into your already sensitive ass, forcing you apart and penetrating you in a manner you know is wholly unnatural for any man to experience.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/anal4.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Mitch fucks your tight, little asshole until you squeal with pain.   It becomes clear you can do nothing.  Clenching only serves to make Mitch moan with pleasure, so you finally just completely submit, relaxing your anal muscles completely and letting the man you hate the most have his way with you.  After about twenty minutes of hard pounding, Mitch finally fills your ass with his cum.

But his ejaculation doesn’t slow Mitch’s assault of you.  He pulls he spent cock back to your anus, rubbing the leaking head on the [[sensitive flesh of your anus.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="571" name="sensitive flesh of your anus." tags="" position="13145,18998" size="100,100">“Why are you doing this to me?” you desperately throw the question at Mitch.

Mitch just chuckles.  “I thought that was fucking obvious.  In the end we both want this, Taylor.” 

“No…” you whimper.

“Yes,” Mitch corrects you.  “Here.”  Mitch gives you another bump.  You feel the shitty, oppressive atmosphere instantly disappear, ushered in by a fresh breeze of euphoric wind.

“Feel better?”

“Mhmm!  If you share your drugs with me I will hang out with you,” you bargain.  Once you say the words you feel suddenly relieved.  Now instead of decisions and consequences you can focus on what feels good: doing drugs and fucking a hot guy you despise.

“Deal!  So good to hear you agree to be my slut, Taylor.  I knew you had it in you.  I am going to get off so fucking much and in the process [[I bet you will too.]]”

“See, stunning, eh?  Now for all my hard work, I demand you let me take you on a shopping adventure!”

//What?//  “Your reward is… to buy me clothes?” you repeat incredulously.

“Yep!” Julie answers with a smile.  “But first we have more work to do~” 

Your sister’s tone immediately puts you on your guard.

“What do you mean, Julie?”

“Oh, //nothing!//” Julie says as she takes a seat next to you.

“Uh...can I help you with something?  Look at what you did to me already!”

“Mhmm.  Exactly why I can’t stop, you’re like an unfinished project and I am a completionist.  Maybe you can “help” me.  What do you think of these?”  Your sister spreads out her hands and wiggles her [[bright red painted fingernails.]]

Just when you have had enough of invading your friend’s privacy, your eyes fall upon a single image that stands out amongst the rows of obvious cumshots and facials.

With a feeling of terror, you click on the picture and have your worst fears confirmed.

“This has to be a mistake…” you say in an attempt to futilely rationalize what you are seeing.  Yet as you scroll through more pictures, you find several more awkward creep shots of //yourself//...interspersed with countless cumshot and blowjob pictures.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taycandid.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“What?  When?  Where did he--?  How?  EW! No....”

You close the folder, rise from your chair, and step away from the computer.  Your mind is left spinning.  You were well aware Drew found your new body to be attractive but this was a whole new level of creepy obsession entirely.

Just when you think things cannot possible get any more fucked up, your eyes land on the radioactive appearing waste basket next to Drew’s computer.  You find it stacked to the rim with familiar looking clumped wads of toilet paper and tissue.

[[You hear the squeaking noise of a rusty hinge.  Drew is opening the bathroom door in the hall.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="574" name="What am I going to do with this?" tags="" position="6878,14561" size="100,100">
From your position it would be easy to suck on Drew’s dick, but the mere idea immensely creeps you out and just reminds you how weird your life has become.  //Hmm… I guess that only leaves one option.//

You take Drew’s penis and cradle it in your soft hands.  You can feel the blood rushing to his extremity, swelling his member to its maximum size.  Drew’s manhood is about average sized, fairly similar to how yours once appeared.  The reminder of your missing manhood turns your stomach.  //I am missing mine...but Drew clearly still has his….//  You give Drew’s shaft a few tentative pumps and Drew moans loudly in pleasure.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hj4.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The next thing you know, you are giving your friend a hand job, masturbating his cock as you would have once done with your own.  

“OH MY GOD!” Drew yells after about thirty seconds.  You watch in horrified fascination as your pumping hand brings Drew to climax.  His manhood bulges and pusles, filling your hand and spilling out between your fingers until the area around Drew’s penis is covered with cum.

“Wow,” you say with amazement.  “You came so much…”  //For me?  Uh...//  You aren&#39;t quite sure how to feel about that. 

Aside from Drew’s panting, his reply is just silence.  You use some tissues to clean yourself up and head to the washroom.  When you return, you look at Drew and find that he appears to be passed out with a blissful smile on his face.

You sigh, suddenly feeling quite ashamed.  //What have I done?// That part was obvious.  //Why did I do it?// seems to be the more pertinent question.

“Please…Get me out...Heelllp….”

“Ugh...Taylor I will probably help you.  But you //REALLY// fucking owe me.  I can’t even believe I am considering this…let alone fucking doing it.  I know I shouldn’t even be talking to you, but here I am, drawn to you like a moth to a fucking flame.”

“T--thank you.”

“Agh!  Hey I didn’t accept yet.  It is my ass on the line just as much as yours!”

“Please...I will do anything!  Just get me the fuck out of here.”

Damien paces beside your bedside.  He looks like he is fighting an intense internal battle with himself.  Damien has always been more than a tad selfish, you are somewhat shocked he is even here at all, let alone offering to help you.  Finally, Damien takes several deep breaths through his nose and nods.

“Okay.  I will help you, Taylor.  But I am not a soft hearted charity case either.  I expect you to pay me back.”

“Yes!  Just fucking help me!” you readily agree.

You watch with horrified fascination as the man gestures at the body on the bed.  Moments later, the comatose patient is wheeled out in your place, to some unknown and potentially gruesome fate.

You have never been more thankful for taking those extra shots with Damien during your final year.

“Okay!  Let’s go!”  Damien escorts you to a break room and grabs some items from a locker. Damien tosses you a loose grey coloured T-shirt and sweatpants.  “Hurry!  Get changed!”  he shouts at you.

You hesitate for an instant with a downward glance at the alien mounds on your chest, but your fear and need for haste overcomes any sense of modesty.  You tear off the hospital gown and go commando in your new loose- fitting sweats.  Damien eagerly watches you undress and you do your best to ignore him.

“Wait!” Damien stops you as you are about to dash home.  “They know your name and where you live.  They might even be watching your house.  It is only a matter of time before they figure out their mistake!  You cannot go home!”

“Fuck!  You are right.  Where am I going to go?  What the hell am I going to do?  FUCK!”

“Here,” Damien hands you a card and a key.  

“What’s this?  It is my driver’s license and a key to my house.  Go there and lie low and I will come find you later.”

There is random clutter and garbage strewn everywhere along with many booze bottles.  //I guess Damien still enjoys a drink...or more than a few,// you dryly note as you inspect a giant garbage bag filled past its bursting point with what appears to be mostly hard liquor bottles.  //Geez, shouldn’t a scientific guy like Damien know what this does to his liver?//

You tiptoe through Damien’s house feeling like a stranger or a cat burglar.  You are in a foreign body in a foreign home.  Nothing feels quite right, not even your own damned skin.

Your loose sweat pants keep reminding you of the haunting void now present between your legs.  Your lack of underwear coupled with the presence of your foreign genitals serves to make you deeply uncomfortable.  You consider appropriating some shorts from Damien but the the idea of wearing your friend’s underwear really grosses you out, so you opt to continue commando-mode while snatching a pair of socks from his dresser.

You huddle alone in the dark for hours, not even daring to turn on the TV.  You just silently brood.  //Why the fuck---how the fuck did this happen to me!?//

Some time after midnight, Damien finally returns from the hospital.  He stalks into the house angrily and pours himself a trio of vodka shots and downs them one after another.

“They fucking interrogated me for hours!” Damien complains after his fifth drink.

You are almost too scared to ask.  “Who did?  The hospital?  Or…”  //Shadowy, clandestine organisations?//

“The hospital admin.  They were furious.  But luckily “something” wiped the cameras clean so there is no [[evidence of any wrongdoing.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="581" name="evidence of any wrongdoing." tags="" position="14594,4903" size="100,100">“You hacked the hospital computers for me?”

“What?  No, I assume the men in black did it to hide their arrival and absconding with the patient...er you.”

“That isn’t good…”

“Tell me about!  I am getting like //Danger Zone// level vibes here.  I never should have helped you.  Fuck.  Why did I help you?”

“Because you’re a good guy?” you venture.  Damien rolls his eyes and doesn’t even dignify your assertion with a response.  “So what am I...we-what are //we// going to do?”

“Well, speaking for myself, I am going to have another drink!” Damien announces while grabbing several bottles down from his cupboards.

“Dude, we are going up against potentially the most powerful government or corporations on Earth….and you want to have a drink?”

“Wow, when you put it //that way// I think I will have a heck of a lot more than one.  I don’t want to end up in an anonymous fucking grave in the desert!  Oh jeez...why did I help you again?”

“Because they were going to abduct and murder me!”

“And now I might get murdered!  Besides, the murder part is only speculation.  And is it really murder if they cryogenically freeze you or something?”

“YES!  It is...oh fuck….I really really REALLY don’t want that to happen...”

“My sentiments as well.  Now on to better things.  Let’s celebrate your freedom.  Have a drink with me!”

“Uh…”  //Drinking right now is either the greatest or worst idea I have ever heard!//  [[It bothers you that you can’t quite decide which.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="582" name="It bothers you that you can’t quite decide which." tags="" position="14744,4996" size="100,100">Damien pushes a drink towards you.  “Come on, I saved your life.  The least you could do is share a fucking drink with me, right?  Are you //really// Taylor Roux?”

“Fine.  Bottoms-fucking-up!”  You down a shot of vodka and the almost gasoline-like taste makes you choke.  Two shots later, you do admittedly feel quite a bit better.

“So where are you going to stay?” Damien asks you after draining an entire bottle of cheap vodka.  //Oh fuck, I hadn’t thought about that...//  Damien reads your expression, “Well you can’t really go home...or anywhere really...I am really glad I am not in your shoes.”

“Fuck… you are right.”  You had imagined returning home once the “heat” died down.  But having a magical sex change in front of a cadre of doctors has apparently shone a spotlight on you...for good and ill.  You suddenly feel hopeless and your eyes sting to hold back tears.  What happened to you wasn’t fair. You appear to be completely fucked.  //What am I going to do!?  Fucking hell...//

“Well you can be my roomie for a bit but I expect rent paid in addition to the huge debt you already owe me.  Feel free to repay me anytime,” Damien throws out the offer.

//I don’t really have any ideas I can think of…  Maybe I could hide out with Evan or Drew...but do I really want to drag my friends into this bullshit?  I don’t want them to get shot or something...//  You feel like you have somehow become a participant in [[a spy movie with a really bizarre plot.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="583" name="a spy movie with a really bizarre plot." tags="" position="14597,5061" size="100,100">“Repayment?  Right now?  That’s what’s on your mind!?  I don’t have any money.  You have to give me time, man, not dog me like a fucking mafia loan shark!”

“Well your debt is huge and circumstances are pretty shady… I should charge you a VIG.”

“Fuck you and your interest!  You aren’t a bank.  We are in serious trouble here.”

“Exactly why I wouldn’t mind some interest payments, if you know what I mean.”  Damien gives you a smile full of crooked teeth.

“Uh...no...What do you mean?”

“I accept Mastercard and blowjobs,” Damien jokes.

“Huh!?  //What!?//  Ew!”

“Compared to the risk I took for you, getting me off is like a drop in the bucket of your huge lake of debt,” Damien evenly responds.  There is definitely an edge to his voice you don’t like.

“You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Everything in my life is fucked!  And you want to prey on me!?  Look at me!” you gesture at your breasts.

“You aren’t helping your case by drawing attention to those beauties.  To be honest, I thought you were pretty cute before, but now, wow!”

“What?  You thought I was cute...as a dude!?”

“Hey!  A nice ass is a nice; my dick can’t tell the difference.”

//What the fuck?  Damien is bisexual?//  You never would have guessed given the literally dozens of times you have seen him get slapped pursuing members of the opposite sex.  //He basically admitted to liking my ass...as a guy!  What a degenerate!  Bisexual people should just pick a fucking side!// you fume.  //I think Damien is just so horny and opportunistic it maybe isn’t such a condemnation of his sexuality.  I suppose he just got so drunk and horny one night after so many rejections things just got out of hand.//

“What did I do to deserve this?”

“Probably nothing.  [[Life isn’t fair.]]”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="584" name="Life isn’t fair." tags="" position="14747,5202" size="200,200">“That doesn’t mean you should be a dick!”
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
“C’mon, Taylor.  I did you a major solid!  And let’s be real here: I already know how big of pervert you are from our drinking “sessions”.  Everything is worth trying once, right?  And to be fair, if you help me out I will let you crash here rent free AND as part of the bargain I will also help you research your condition.  A total babe and a fascinating science project?  This is totally up my alley!”

“You are such a moron.”

“No, I am actually quite smart! You are in my debt and don’t really have that many options.  It is just the two of us here! You know I am great at keeping secrets.  Now we have doctor-patient confidentiality in effect.  So //please// suck my dick.  I am fucking dying here, Taylor.”

Damien shrugs. “If it meant not getting murdered?  Of course.”

“You’re such an asshole.”

“Ughhh!  I //love// asshole!  But one step at a time, Taylor!  Let’s start with your sweet little mouth why don’t we?”

“I hate you so much right now.”

“Oh come on, look on the bright side.  You get to suck on my awesome //mega-meat-hammer!//”

You cringe.  You feel depressed and hollow as you realize you have internally agreed to do what it takes to survive.  Even if it means sucking a dick...//Damien’s// dick.  Yet how can you refuse?  Your very life seems to be on the line.

“Whoa!  Hold up.  Strip down for me first.”

“What the fuck?”

You look at Damien in disbelief but he stares back at you, his brow furrowing in what you can only assume is anger or frustration.

“Fine, you big fucking creep.”  You slide off your sweat pants and toss them aside while Damien watches your actions like a [[hungry wolf eying a lamb.]]

“Happy?”

“Wow, no underwear!  Nice.  Keep going!” Damien urges you.

“Uhh…  You know I don&#39;t have any...”

“That&#39;s great but please hurry up!  I can already see your pussy, so don’t be one, Taylor!”

“This is //so// fucked though…”

Damien is naked in a flash.  “Oh my god, Taylor!.  What an ass!  I am fucking rock hard!”  A glance at Damien’s large, bobbing erection sets loose butterflies within your stomach.  “Lie down on the couch and get comfortable!” [[Damien suggests.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="590" name="Damien suggests." tags="" position="14591,5714" size="100,100">You grudgingly comply and plop down on the couch.  With a sickening chuckle, Damien pulls your T-shirt over your head.

“Nice little titties there too, Taylor!  This is fucking perfect.  Now suck my cock!” he orders you.

As Damien moves his disgusting penis towards your face, you choose to not fight against the inevitable and open your mouth.

Without further ado, Damien thrusts his cock down your throat.  You are assaulted by the foul stench of Damien’s groin as his dark, curly pubes press into your face.

“Uhnnghh!!”  You protest and sputter and cough.  //Holy fuck!  This is even grosser than I imagined!  Fuuuuuckkk!  [[Why am I sucking Damien’s dick?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="591" name="Why am I sucking Damien’s dick?" tags="" position="14738,5821" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damiendtbargain.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fuck!  This is the best!” Damien moans as he roughly fucks your throat while you gag and cough. 

 You go red faced and gasp for air before Damien finally allows you a brief respite to breathe.

Obscene sounds echo throughout the living room as Damien seeks his own pleasure.

“Oh shit!  I am going to cum!” Damien announces as he pushes he cock as far down your airway as possible. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... That felt great.  Amazing job,” Damien compliments you when he is done unloading his sperm down your throat. 

&quot;Fwahhh....&quot; You rub your belly and force back the urge to vomit.  //Ugh… I can’t believe I have Damien’s semen inside me... This is the worst...//

You doubt that even a million bars of soap would be able to purge the foul, bitter taste now lingering on your tongue.

“You can sleep on the couch here if you want,&quot; Damien offers. &quot;I will see if I can come up with some ideas tomorrow.  We shall see if we can get to the bottom of this- and [[maybe have a bit of fun in the process too, eh?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="592" name="maybe have a bit of fun in the process too, eh?”" tags="" position="14592,5868" size="100,100">It takes you ages to fall asleep. Your dreams are strange, filled with with indistinct images of pursuit that make you feel scared and alone. //I am trapped...//

The next day you sleep in, feeling absolutely shitty.  Whether it is from your hangover or the awful events of the previous night, you cannot quite say. After waking, you drag yourself to Damien’s laptop and try some generic google searches.  

“Fuck...this is going to take forever!”

Eight hours later, you feel much the same way.

//Kacha.  Crack.//  You hear the door to Damien’s house open.

“I got a potential cure for you!” Damien excitedly announces when he rushes into the kitchen

“[[REALLY!?  Fuck, you are the best!]]” Your hopes soar.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="593" name="REALLY!?  Fuck, you are the best!" tags="" position="14743,5971" size="100,100">Damien sets down a bottle of green liquid on the kitchen counter with a flourish.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/greenpot.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“What is that?”

“It is something I got from the black market.  It cost a lot of money but they say it has a hundred oercent success rate.”

“This can change me back into a man?” you wonder with a note of skepticism as you inspect the labelless bottle and the mysterious emerald fluid inside.

“Right… magically transforming into a girl is possible but a green potion returning you to normal...yeah. [[That is crazy.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="594" name="That is crazy." tags="" position="14594,6016" size="100,100">“Hmm…”  Damien did have a point.  //Something is better than nothing, right?//  You figure the worst case scenario is a night of diarrhea.  “Who did you get this from?”

“A very reputable Chinese dealer.  He only sells legit stuff, so don’t worry.  Now bottoms up!  Make sure to drink the whole thing or he says it might not work,” Damien urges you.

As the strangely bitter green liquid flows down your throat, you immediately start to feel warm, as if the bottle was filled with pure alcohol.  “You didn’t give me fucking absinthe or something, did you?”

“Huh….absinthe is one of the ingredients I think,” Damien recalls.

“You...have...got...to...be...fucking….kidding….me….”  You feel the world spin around you.  For a moment you feel so dizzy you are certain you will vomit, yet a couple of moments later, you suddenly feel surprisingly clear headed...and unbearably horny.

It starts slowly at first, but soon a dull warmth between your legs is fanned into a raging, wet inferno, yet your juicies do nothing to calm your intense heat and yearning.  Your legs start to wobble and you feel your vagina begin to drip and cover your thighs and sweatpants with fluid.  It isn’t long before you feel like you have pissed yourself.

“W-what the hell did you do to me?” you demand of Damien.  You are now sweating profusely as if the room’s temperature had suddenly been turned up to a hundred degrees.

Damien watches you with a grin for a long moment before replying.  “That green potion is one of the most potent aphrodisiacs in the world,” Damien informs you as if the revelation was inconsequential.

“You bastard!” you curse as you feel your hand involuntarily drawn to your tingling, wet sex.

“I knew you wouldn’t want to fuck, so I figured [[“why not add a little incentive?””]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="595" name="“why not add a little incentive?””" tags="" position="14739,6117" size="100,100">“You’re sick.”

“Nah, you look like the sick one, Taylor.  The only cure for a sopping wet pussy like that is a good fucking.  I got just the tool here to fix ya up!” Damien jokes as he grabs his crotch and obvious erection.

“Damien, what the fuck?  We are supposed to be friends...and we are both dudes.”

“Neither of those things bother me.  You owe me a lifetime debt, Taylor.  Letting me try out your new pussy seems like a win-win for both of us.”

“Gross!  Speak for yourself!”

“I am.  But it is obvious you want this more than I do,” Damien speculates, withdrawing a glistening finger from your nether lips.  “You have got to be curious too, right?”

//I don’t even fucking know what the hell is going on anymore!  All this shit just happened to me!//  Maybe you are a bit curious about your new body, but you are a [[thousand times more freaked out.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="596" name="thousand times more freaked out." tags="" position="14596,6165" size="100,100">“Damien, you can garnish my wages for fucking life but I am not ...having sex… with you.  Uhnn!” you yelp as Damien returns his hand between your leg and slowly begins to rub you.

“Uh!  Hey!  Don’t just fucking touch me, you creep!” you protest.  Damien ignores you and continues to stubbornly massage your new pussy.  “Damien!  Please stop!” you yelp in vain.

“I will after I make you cum,” Damien absently replies.  His fingers begin to move faster, and press more firmly into your sensitive, soaked flesh.

“Uhnn!  Damien!  Please no! Ahhh! Aiiie!” you wail as Damien finger fucks you like a human vibrator.  After a couple of minutes, you begin to feel a familiar yet distinct feeling of growing pressure. “Oh...my!  Uhh…. I am….”  //I am going to cum!  Damien is going to make me orgasm!//

And, just like that, Damien pushes you over the edge.  You feel your neck go limp and your limbs flail around as undulating pulses of pleasurable warmth radiate throughout your body.  You  flood with love juice as you flop over into Damien’s waiting arms.

“See!  That was obviously fun!”

You just keep panting and struggle to regain your breath.  You stare up at the ceiling, your eyes [[not quite able to focus.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="597" name="not quite able to focus." tags="" position="14742,6272" size="100,100">
“Now on to the real fun.  You will never be able to resist this!” Damien lewdly predicts.

When your eyes finally focus, you see Damien standing next to the screen door leading to his deck, his huge cock standing at full attention, obviously yearning to be inside you.  //Inside me!?  Fuck!  I can’t think straight!  What the hell was in that green shit!?//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damiendick.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

“What do you think?” Damien enquires when he sees you [[staring wide-eyed at his dick.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="598" name="staring wide-eyed at his dick." tags="" position="14587,6323" size="100,100"> //That’s my problem!  I can’t think!//  “I--I don’t…think...this is a good idea...” you lamely answer.

“Hah!  Well you will change your mind in a few minutes.  Now strip down and lie on the couch.  I want you butt-up, too,” Damien adds.

You just stare at Damien in utter disbelief.  //Does he really think he can just fucking boss me around?  Sure, I owe him...but fucking wow, what a creep.//

After about a minute of silence, Damien gets visibly annoyed.  He walks up to you naked, his erection flopping around as he approaches.  His expression is unreadable but a moment later you understand his intent.

In one smooth motion, Damien rips your T-shirt off, pulling it over your head.  As your new breasts spill free, Damien sits down on the couch, pulling you with him.  He then begins to roughly fondle you, pushing you backwards onto the cushions.

Your instincts scream at you to run but you remain motionless. //No!  Nooooo!  Why can’t I fight back!?//  You consider kicking Damien in the face but the moment passes and you try to more gently push him back with your foot.  He grabs your pale, soft leg and runs his hand down your inner thigh.  Damien then hooks his thumbs around the elastic and pulls your crotch-[[soaked sweatpants off you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="599" name="soaked sweatpants off you." tags="" position="14742,6419" size="100,100">You and Damien are now both completely naked. The horrible gravity of the situation threatens to crush you. Damien looms above you, looking impossibly large.  You look at your soaked pussy and Damien’s hard cock with confusion.  //No... I can’t lose myself like this!  I am a man!  I can’t... have SEX with Damien!  This is so fucking wrong!//

“Uhhh!” you yelp as Damien fondles your soaked labia.  

“Yep, you are ready.  Trust me, Taylor.  This is going to be awesome for us both.”  Damien’s strong arms flip you onto your stomach, your bare ass and pussy presented to your old friend.

“Alright!  Fuck yes!  Let’s do this, Taylor!”

//Nooooooooo!// you internally scream as Damien’s huge cock presses into your virgin pussy from behind.

“Uhhhhhnnnnnnnghh!   Hnnnnggghhh…..fuck...why?”  //Holy shit I am having sex with Damien...//  You feel so disgusting and ashamed yet the green potion allows you no respite.

The brief moment of viriginal pain is soon gone, lost in a wave of hormones and endorphins and [[magical chemicals.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="600" name="magical chemicals." tags="" position="14588,6466" size="100,100">“Holy fuck!  You are so tight!  Taylor you have the best pussy ever!” Damien compliments you as his pubes and balls slap into you with each deep, penetrating thrust.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/damiencouch.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The whole situation is so fucked up and surreal that you maintain a surprising level of awareness.  //A couple of weeks ago the world was my oyster and I wanted nothing more than to find a cute girlfriend for the semester...I wanted to get laid so badly...//  Yet now you are the one playing a girlfriend’s role.  You are having sex but it is not at all how you imagined it...The perspective is all //wrong.//  Instead of filling a pussy, there is a cock inside you...in //your pussy.//    And to make matters worse, your warped mind wants more of it, to chase this new tingling urge and venture into a world of unexplored feminine pleasure you can see on the horizon like Columbus discovering a vast new land.

//This is by far the most fucked up moment of my life!//  It hurts.  It feels good.  It feels awful and weird all the same time.

//Fap. Fap Fap-fap-fap!//

“Ohhhh….”  You hear yourself moan with pleasure.  //Oh god, do I sound like that?//  Your whole world feels like it is melting.  You make the sudden determination that unless you act now, you will have serious problems recovering from this experience.

“Uh…”  //Why does this feel so good!?  Losing my virginity to this creep...feels amazing!  Am I going completely nuts?//  You feel like the last vestiges of your composure are about to vanish.

You decide to:

[[Submit to the green warmth for a moment]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="601" name="Submit to the green warmth for a moment" tags="" position="14735,6637" size="100,100">You curse Damien and his aphrodisiac.  Perhaps a small part of you is glad for the excuse.  //The potion is just too strong!//

You find yourself slowly moving in time with Damien’s thrusts.  You bounce your butt back into his pistoning member and can’t help but squeal as you cum on your friend’s cock.  You grip the armrest and bite your lip as your orgasm sweeps over you.  To your horror and ultimate delight, the orgasm doesn’t cease, for as Damien continues pounding you, you are soon pushing into another round of shivering, blissful warmth.

Afterwards, you just lie on the couch twitching.  You feel used and broken, rebuilt but also  redefined.  You have never felt such pleasure before in your life.  As you watch Damien’s thick, white semen drip from your puckered young pussy, you cannot help but feel like your life has truly changed beyond repair.

“Hop in!” Ryan calls out to you.  You stare at the sleek vehicle with jealousy.  //I always wanted a car like this!//

//At least I get to rid in one...// you console yourself as you climb inside and sit down.  The leather interior grips your ass as you fidget in your seat.  Ten seconds later, you are zipping through the city streets, heading toward distant mountains.

“This is a nice car,” you comment.  

“Yeah, a nice car, the open road, and a gorgeous babe sitting beside me -- I like the finer things in life!” [[Ryan jokingly confides.]]

Ryan turns onto the highway and the two of you race down the road, passing by the slower vehicles as if they were standing still.  You feel a rush of adrenaline and lose yourself in the feel of the rumbling car that almost seems to fly across the pavement.

After a few minutes, you thank Ryan for agreeing to help you.  The two of you make polite small talk for a bit while Ryan fiddles with the stereo.

“So what--whoa hold on!” Ryan stops mid sentence and cranks up the radio.  He starts singing along with the playing song in a clear, strong tenor.  You watch and listen with a growing smile as Ryan rocks out.  For a momen,t he looks just like a little kid.  The scene is would almost be funny...if Ryan didn’t have such a soothing voice.  Ryan gets really into the old rock song, hitting all the notes and nailing every lyric, including the weird high notes this particular song has towards the end.  Ryan clearly enjoys the music and singing along with it.  He doesn’t seem to care what the other drivers on the road think of him, or you for that matter.  He just wants to have fun and revel in the moment.  You again find yourself admiring Ryan’s confidence.  //Who would have thought this guy can sing too?//  Ryan’s list of talents seemed to grow by the day.

Once the song is over, Ryan turns down the music and resumes his earlier conversation as if [[nothing had interrupted it in the first place.]]

Ryan chuckles.  “Nah, they are just… //rocks.//  You, Taylor… on the other hand, are truly //beautiful.//”

Your mother had once called you handsome.  Now Ryan is calling you beautiful...and he is serious.  //Fucking wow!//

You find your last breath draws deeper than expected and you nearly choke on it.  You suddenly have an uncontrollable urge to swallow yet find your mouth dry as a bone.  You want to tell Ryan he is being stupid but you can’t quite manage to get the words to escape your lips.  You decide to say nothing and distract yourself by admiring the view and letting your eyes scan the jagged, [[snow-capped horizons.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="608" name="snow-capped horizons." tags="" position="12464,16540" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mount.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; height=&quot;450px&quot;&gt;
“We are almost there!” Ryan informs you after another half an hour of driving.

“Where are we going exactly?”

“Well I though I&#39;d take you up to the new research lab at Cassier but first things first!”

‘You didn’t really answer the question,” you note.

“Hah!  Got me.  We are heading to my uncle’s place.  I got something planned for us.”  //Ooooh mysterious!//

Ryan turns off the highway onto a gravel road and drives up to a rustic looking house.

“We are here!” [[Ryan announces]] as you pull up next to a garage and shed near the rear of the property.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="609" name="Ryan announces" tags="" position="12600,16644" size="100,100">You hop out of the car.  “What the fuck is that?” 

“That, my dear, is our //ride//!” Ryan replies as he gestures to an ATV parked nearby.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/atv.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//”My dear!?”  My fucking sanity!//  Ryan tosses you a helmet.  You stare at him with bewilderment.  “And //obviously!//  I thought we were visiting a lab!”

“After our ride.  I figured we might as well make the journey to the lab an adventure!  It is a long drive, so might as well enjoy it, right?”

“That’s…”  //Thoughtful?  Nice?  A waste of time?//  “...a good idea,” you manage.

“Hurry up!  The day is wasting away, Taylor!” Ryan shouts to you as he sits down on the quad in the middle of the seat.  He grins at you as he pulls a helmet over his head.

You look at the ATV with a feeling of anxiety.  Yet using the machine isn’t what is bothering you.  Since you’re pretty tiny, Ryan seems quite eager for you to sit up front.  Still, that would probably be even extra weird...which is not desirable given how supremely weird things already are between the two of you.  Still, the idea of your butt pressed into Ryan’s crotch is both a bit of a turn on...even if it is pretty weird to think about.
[[Sit in front of Ryan]]
[[Sit in the back]]x</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="610" name="Sit in front of Ryan" tags="" position="12449,16794" size="100,100">You decide to sit in the front.  Since Ryan drove you all the way here, naturally it is your turn to drive this sweet ATV!  

You hit the ignition button and the quad roars to life.  //Holy shit!  This is awesome!// you think as you put the vehicle in gear and race forward.  

You can hear Ryan chuckling behind you.  He points at a trail to your left and you steer towards it.  You are instantly engulfed in a scenic mountain adventure and the adrenaline rush of a sweet ride.  Despite the late fall season and high altitude, it is surprisingly warm...or at least you feel that way.  You are grateful for the tart breeze wind that nips at your exposed flesh.

For a blissful half hour, you forget all your worries, losing yourself in the joy of navigating the trail and admiring the beautiful surroundings.

//Hmmm….//  “Mmm…”  //Uh oh...// You suddenly realise the rumbling quad is acting like a giant vibrator.  And Ryan’s proximity coupled with the way he is pressing into you from behind [[hardly helps your state of mind.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="611" name="Sit in the back" tags="" position="12759,16692" size="100,100">Non-romantic bail-out under construction</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="612" name="as you admire the spot." tags="" position="12446,16938" size="100,100">You hear Ryan rustling behind you and you spin around just as he finishes setting down a picnic basket and blanket.  Your jaw drops.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/picnic.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“You planned this…?  For me?”  //I don’t think I have ever been on a picnic before...//

“For //us//,” Ryan gently corrects you.  “I was thinking about you but I am kind of hungry too!”

“Okay then I will let you have some too!”

Ryan laughs.  “Okay, how about letting me drive the rest of the way to the lab as well?”

“Aww!  But I was having so much fun.  I guess you can drive next...and have some food.”

“That’s so generous of you!”

“Oh wow you brought wine too!” you cheer as you dig through the picnic basket that Ryan must have stashed in a small box on the ATV’s rear rack.

“And grapes,” Ryan adds.

“Grapes are better as wine,” you opine.

Ryan chuckles.  “I agree.”

The two of you watch a pair of bald eagles play in the clear blue skies above [[while enjoying a delicious lunch.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="613" name="while enjoying a delicious lunch." tags="" position="12590,17040" size="100,100">You pluck a grape from the bunch and are about to pop it into your mouth when you catch Ryan staring at you.  “What?  You are looking at this grape like my dog used to look at his favourite chew toy!” you tease your companion.  You shimmy over to Ryan on your knees and slowly place the grape in his mouth.  As Ryan’s lips close around the grape, they kiss your fingertips and you suddenly feel a chill run down your spine.  //Fuck!//

“Whoa!  What are you--ohh~!” your protest morphs into a moan of pleasure.  Seconds later, Ryan has nearly devoured your arm, covering your delicate fingers and wrist in sensual kisses.  When you finally manage to pull your hand away, it almost looks like you have just scalded it with hot water yet you feel the opposite of pain, although you are undeniably warm.  You look into Ryan’s blue eyes, crystal clear like soft, untouched mountain pools.  Your hand isn’t the only thing that has heated up...for you realize you are breathing deeply and struggling to take in enough air to keep your light headed thoughts at bay.  You suddenly feel like the whole damn open world around you feels stuffy and claustrophobic. 

//So this is what it feels like...to go insane?  To fall in love?  What the hell has happened to me?//  You and Ryan lock eyes and that is the moment it truly strikes you.  You have only ever felt like this while mooning over Samantha.  Yet now you hold such feelings for //Ryan.//  You’re a man...but yet you’re not.  The whole world is truly fucked up and the only stable, positive thing in it that you can see is the handsome, smiling man sitting in front of you.

“It is days like this I am glad to be alive,” Ryan opines, [[as if reading your thoughts.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="614" name="as if reading your thoughts." tags="" position="12450,17086" size="100,100">“Me too…” you admit.  //Maybe being a girl isn’t the worst thing ever...if it means prolonging this feeling...If it means I get to spend time with Ryan like this.// The rest of the issues swirling in your chaotic mind fade into the background.  Your priorities should be clear, and you find that they are - just with an unexpected result.  Clearly, solving your mystery is of relatively low importance for you right now compared to the longing within your heart.  “Ryan…” you whisper your companion’s name.

“Taylor…” Ryan imitates you, his voice a throaty growl.  Ryan’s hypnotizing blue eyes suddenly appear so large you lose yourself in the huge, dark pupils in their centre.  You can feel your self control evaporate by the second until, before you know it, it is gone completely.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

“Mmmphmmm!”  Your mind goes blank when Ryan’s lips meet your own.

You make out with Ryan in your secluded, romantic little mountain top meadow [[for what seems like ages.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="615" name="for what seems like ages." tags="" position="12590,17188" size="100,100">“Ahh...damn!” Ryan curses with a scowl at the sun’s position.  You are both hot and bothered.  You can feel Ryan’s erection pressing into your thigh.  “We better hurry...ahh...I made an appointment.  We don’t want to be late,” Ryan informs you.

//Oh fuck...the lab...I almost forgot...Damnit, Ryan!  Stop fucking distracting me!//

You give Ryan one last lingering kiss before you pry yourself away from him.  Ryan quickly packs up and starts the ATV.  Ryan sits in the middle of the seat and motions for you to sit in front of him.

“I thought you wanted to drive.”

“I uh...changed my mind.”

“Uh-huh!” you say with a roll of your eyes.  You put your helmet back on and sit in front of Ryan.  You can now feel Ryan’s boner pressing between your ass cheeks.

You head off down the trail, the rumbling quad between your legs while your sister’s boyfriend’s cock pushes into your butt.

You are still woefully aroused from your make out session and the earlier ride.  Now, you are becoming almost dangerously horny.  //Fuck...I can feel Ryan’s dick...ahh...FUCK!//  You find yourself subtly grinding against the raised hump of the seat.

Your slender arms are already sore from the effort of steering but you keep pushing yourself forward.  You are about to call for a break just [[as Ryan begins to grind against you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="616" name="as Ryan begins to grind against you." tags="" position="12446,17238" size="100,100">
Suddenly you emerge from the forest into an open area.  In the distance you can see what appears to be a slightly out of place chalet.  You change your mind as you get closer for the “chalet” is clearly enormous - the parking lots alone are several football fields in size.  “What the hell is this place?  It is huge!” you remark.

You park the ATV in a mostly empty parking lot near the entrance into the giant chalet-like structure.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mountainlab.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Trans Corp owns...all this?”

“No, only like a third of it,” Ryan answers as he sets down his helmet.  “Follow me, the main [[entrance is over here...uh, I think…]]”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="617" name="entrance is over here...uh, I think…" tags="" position="12590,17348" size="100,100">Eventually you find your way inside.  Ryan swaggers up to a lonely receptionist.  “I was wondering if my lovely friend and I could get a tour of your fine establishment?”

“I am sorry sir we don’t normally do things like that…” the secretary answers, clearly surprised you even turned up at such a remote location.

“I called ahead.  I am Ryan Creston.  I have done a lot of work for your consortium.”

“I see,” the woman replies.  “Yeah...there is a note here.  There is no one around so I guess that means I have to take you then,” the secretary concludes, clearly not impressed by such a prospect.

“Thanks!  That would be great!”

Despite the secretary’s protests and the empty parking lot, the lab seems to have a lot of people working inside.  “So what are all these people doing?” you wonder.

“These “people” are researchers and they are doing cutting edge research and conducting thousands of concurrent experiments.  They are studying everything from human longevity to black hole formation here at this facility.  The Grandridge Laboratory is maintained jointly by a co-op of public and private sector actors...”

“[[Trans Corp!?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="618" name="Trans Corp!?" tags="" position="12446,17390" size="100,100">“Uh...yes.. Trans Corp is the largest private sponsor.”

“Can you show us their section please?” Ryan requests.

“I am afraid not.  The Trans Corp section requires strictly enforced high level security clearance.  They have a lot of sensitive technology and items they want to protect in their wing.”  The secretary shoots you a glare as if to say, “from people like you!”

After mentioning Trans Corp, your tour guide becomes wary.  You get a passable tour and look in on several projects and experiments in progress yet find nothing particularly interesting or overly suspicious.

After a few hours of wandering under your guide’s watchful gaze, Ryan finally hints it is time to head back.

//Fuck!  I could spend a month out here checking all these projects...and even then I still might not be able to get into the restricted side.//  Your trip appears to be a bust, but you find it hard to think of it that way as you laugh at Ryan’s comments regarding the huge stick he suspects was likely [[lodged up the tour guide’s ass.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="619" name="lodged up the tour guide’s ass." tags="" position="12586,17492" size="100,100">Ryan hops back on the ATV and shoots you a knowing smile as he gestures for you to take your place in front of him.  

“You like me up front, don’t you?” you tease him with an eye roll.

Ryan laughs heartily.  “Seen right through me like I am glass!”

“Fine, your loss!  Driving this thing is fucking wicked!”

You make it most of the way back just as the orange, glowing sun begins to set behind the mountains.  On the last bend before reaching Ryan’s car, you splash through a huge mud filled ditch a little //too// quickly and end up dousing yourself and your passenger with a thick layer of watery muck.

“Fuuuuuuck!  Shit!  God-damnit!”  You curse as you spit out mud.  You had made it through the entire journey almost spotless.

The two of you step off the ATV covered nearly head to toe in mud.  “Great driving!” Ryan sarcastically praises you.  “Except for that last part!”

“Well shit…”

“Could be worse.  I got a great idea.  Follow me!”  Ryan slogs over to the nearby house and unlocks it from a key hidden [[behind a pair of decorative antlers.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="620" name="behind a pair of decorative antlers." tags="" position="12446,17546" size="100,100">As you step inside Ryan hisses at you, “Quick!  Don’t make a big mess!  Get into the bathroom!”

You dash into the bathroom with Ryan.  “So what are...whoaa….”  Your question dies in your throat as Ryan strips down.  You feel a wave of embarrassment wash over you when you realize you are staring open mouthed at Ryan’s well muscled chest and chiselled abdominal muscles.  //Holy fuck...He is like a fucking statue of a Greek god...He shouldn’t bother me but he so does!//  You are so mixed up.  You are jealous and confused and undeniably turned on.  Men have never aroused you before but Ryan sure does.  //He is not a typical man,// you console yourself.

“We are going to have a bath together!” Ryan declares.

“A bath?  //Together!?//”  

“There is room for two in the tub,” Ryan explains as he begins filling the bath.  He then slides his pants off.  You try and look away from his prominent bulge but you find that you cannot.  Your eye’s fall on Ryan’s erection, straining to rip break free from his boxer shorts.

The day has left you too excited to resist Ryan...or an opportunity to indulge in a hot, relaxing, cleansing bath - exactly what you think you need right now.

Ryan grins at you, clearly waiting for you to respond.

“Aghhh…fine,” you respond in a defeated whisper.  //Ryan has already seen me naked anyway...oh fuck I could sure use one of his massages right now...// Your shoulders are stiff from [[steering the quad all day.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="621" name="steering the quad all day." tags="" position="12594,17640" size="100,100">You let your muddy clothes fall to the ground piece by piece.  Ryan submerges himself with a sigh.  After a moment he beckons you to join him.  With only a thin smear of mud to hide your naughty bits, you slowly sink into the tub, eager for the sudsy water to provide you comfort and a degree of privacy.

“Oh this feel so good…  This was a good idea, Ryan.”

Ryan gentle repositions you into a now familiar position.  He begins to massage your shoulders as his cock presses into the small of your back.  Ryan’s touch and the warm water soon defeat most your stresses and worries.

After an enjoyable half hour, Ryan begins to drain the tub - much to your disappointment.

“Hey, don&#39;t look so bumbed out, that was just a rinse,&quot; Ryan attempts to console you.  &quot;We don’t have to finish quite yet.”

You close your eyes and relax as Ryan refills the tub with fresh water.  Ryan has a talent for diffusing your worries.

You suddenly hear the water cut off and water drip from Ryan as he stands, displacing the water in the tub.

You open your eyes to see Ryan’s cockhead right in front of [[your eyes… and mouth.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="622" name="your eyes… and mouth." tags="" position="12444,17690" size="100,100">//Oh fuck...//  You don’t know whether it is because of the heat of the moment or the thrill of action, but you can’t help but take the tip of Ryan’s member in your mouth and roll your tongue over it.  You look up at your handsome idol, silently savouring his manly taste.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocksuck9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;777px&quot; height=&quot;1133px&quot;&gt;
“Ohhh wow…Taylor your mouth...that delicate tongue...oh fuck...the way you suck my cock is amazing!” Ryan gasps, his face a portrait of ecstasy.  Ryan’s reactions goad you forth.  You pull out all your stops and do your sexiest porn star imitation.

You suck on Ryan’s glans, and swirl your tongue repeatedly over his tiny slit.  You slurp up Ryan’s precum eagerly.  You jerk him off gently with one hand while cupping his balls and continuing to work on his head with your wet lips and tongue.

The constant alarm bells in your mind gradually fade.  Not only are you sucking a dick, but you actually find you are enjoying it...and making Ryan feel good after everything he has done for you suddenly becomes of paramount importance.

[[You put your efforts into overdrive.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="623" name="You put your efforts into overdrive." tags="" position="12598,17792" size="100,100">“Mmm!  Mmmgllfgh!” you gag as you take Ryan’s penis too deep inside your throat.  You taste a delightful salty tone and hear nothing but Ryan’s moans, conscious of nothing more than pleasing the hot cock in your mouth.

“Oh my god...like that!  I can’t take it anymore!  Taylor!  I am...AHhhhhh!” Ryan’s climactic moans echo throughout the bathroom as he suddenly begins to ejaculate all over your face.

As Ryan blasts you with semen, you open your mouth and directly receive his cum.  Ryan moans and shudders as his orgasm continues.  Ryan doesn’t stop cumming until you are dripping with his seed and his sperm is pooled around your eyes and sliding down your breasts.  Instead of feeling disgusted...you feel something else - a cross between being giddy and very horny.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumonface2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

You feel your face flush as you look up at Ryan towering above you.  Eager to please, you cannot help but lovingly lap up his cum and work your way to the source.  By the time you finished cleaning his manhood, he is already rock hard again.  As you massage Ryan’s insatiable cock you begin to feel your embarrassment and shame return.

“[[We shouldn’t be doing this…]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="624" name="We shouldn’t be doing this…" tags="" position="12446,17842" size="100,100">“Says who?”

“It is just that… I am new to this.  And then there is Julie...These feelings are making me so confused…” you admit with a blush.

“It is okay,” Ryan answers. “I am here to help,” he whispers to you.

//C’mon Taylor, fucking focus. // You close your eyes and are suddenly conscious of only one thing: the hot pulsing member still in your hand.  As you grip Ryan&#39;s veiny shaft and your tiny hands began to glide up and down it, Ryan begins to moan.  You stop for a moment and look up at him.  Ryan is clearly beyond aroused, he looks distraught now that your movements have stopped.  With an impish smile, you gently brush his penis with your hand and it twitches in excitement, begging for your touch.  You begin to jerk him off again much to his delight.  Yet soon you begin to feel different…  //almost like you have somehow regained control.//  You had obvious power over Ryan and his cock.  Actual, real power.  Ryan was a powerful, rich, successful man and now he was completely at your mercy.  You can’t help but be turned on by this apparent fact.  You massage Ryan’s penis as best you are able.  You can almost swear you feel Ryan’s thundering pulse through his throbbing cock.  At that moment you want nothing more than to bring him to climax. The pace of your pumping accelerates, and soon Ryan is squirming under your assault and more ejecaulate is sent flying through the air.

Ryan leans back with a shudder, [[staring at you adoringly.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="625" name="staring at you adoringly." tags="" position="12586,17940" size="100,100">“Taylor, we have to have sex,” Ryan bluntly insists after he regains his breath.  “It is the only way we will be able to get this...unbearable tension out of our systems.”

“W-what the hell?  S-sex?” you stammer.  //Like...inside me...a penis in...my vagina…  That whole sentence is so wrong! I guess all of this had to lead somewhere...//  Yet still, having sex with your sister’s boyfriend seems to be crossing the line...even further than you already have.

“It will just be our little secret,” Ryan continues assuredly.  He studies your expression and his face softens.  “I won’t ever force you of course.  But I know you are curious.  You were watching your cousin and I before, weren’t you?”

“Maybe…” you stammer.  Your face now feels hot, like you have an intense fever.  //Maybe I am curious,// you admit to yourself.  Yet your admission does little to dull the //wrongness// of the whole situation.  Recalling the night you peeked on Julie and Ryan the first time, you imagine your sister’s orgasm and how happy and blissful she looked.  Sex was obviously pleasurable and you were open minded and interested in most things that ended in fun and feeling good. 

“[[I don’t know if I am ready for that.]]”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="626" name="I don’t know if I am ready for that." tags="" position="12446,17994" size="100,100">
Ryan raises an eyebrow.  “Of course you are.  You’re a grown woman right?”

You wince.  //AHHH!!!//  “Kind of…”

“What you mean?  Are you an adult or not?’

“Yes, I am an adult.”

“Taylor, adults make their own decisions,” he says, making the statement sound a bit insulting.

“I do make my own decisions!”  You don’t want to be manipulated into intercourse but you also don’t want Ryan to think you are a child.

Ryan leans in close to you.  “Well, just be honest with yourself then.”

“I am not sure what you mean…”

Ryan chuckles.  “Okay, how about this: //do you like me?//”

You blush and make an awkward coughing noise.  //Fuck I feel like I am in elementary school...//

Ryan laughs even harder at your reaction.  “Okay, okay, how about this then: do you like spending time with me?”

“Yes…” you admit.

“And you like to feel good right?”

“[[Yeah, I think everybody does….]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="627" name="Yeah, I think everybody does…." tags="" position="12590,18096" size="100,100">“Well, Taylor, do you want to join me one day and have a few hours where you feel better than you ever have before in your life?”

“That’s a bold claim.”

“And if it were true…?”

You take a deep breath to steady the subtly spinning world.  “Then...I //might// consider it.”

“//Might? // C’mon, you’ve got to be more than a bit curious.  Trust me, I won’t let you down --you will have a great time, I assure you- I //promise// you!.”

“Ryan….I…”  He stares at you, pleading with his blue eyes like a big, handsome puppy dog.  “Okay, I will try it,” you finally relent, speaking in a soft, quiet voice. 

Ryan hears you anyway.  He excitedly claps his hands.  “Settled then.  Win-win.  Let me know when you have some free time and are feeling frisky.”  

The drive back home is [[filled with agonizing tension.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="628" name="filled with agonizing tension." tags="" position="12452,18146" size="100,100">Three tortuous days go by as you resist texting Ryan.  You go to class and hide out in your room. You try and play some video games but you find such focus elusive.  It doesn’t matter what you do though, for you cannot tamp down the memories of your time spent with Ryan and the absurd pleasures he has helped you achieve.  You are worried that if your relationship continues on like this you won’t even want to return to the way you once were.  

A thousand pinnacle orgasms were desirable no matter your sex or gender.  If you want to keep spending time with Ryan, you know that it would have to be as a woman.

You try distracting yourself with movies and masturbating but it isn’t enough.  You find your solo orgasms to be shallow and difficult to attain by comparison to your moments with Ryan.  //There is just something about Ryan….//  

“Fuck I am already soooo wet again!  God damnit!  Fuck!  Shit!  Cunt!” you cuss.  The tantrum does make you feel a bit better...but it doesn&#39;t do much for your state of arousal.

Three days after your picnic, you finally cave and text Ryan.

He replies immediately and says he will be &quot;over in a minute.&quot;  

“What the fuck, doesn&#39;t this guy work?”  //Or is he just important enough to leave for a random booty call?  Or...the third option is [[he REALLY likes me...or really wants to bang me at least…]]//

“Ohhh….” you moan as Julie’s experienced tongue along with her soft, yet firmly commanding fingers that somehow seem to know exactly where to push, rub, and tease you in order to coax you all the way to oblivion and back again.

“Holy fuck!  //Julie!//”  //Stop!  Keep going!  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccck!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lesbian pov.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You lose control of your lower body as your groin grinds into Julie&#39;s swirling tongue.  You feel yourself surge past your limitations and you are instantly launched into an orgasm so intense it leaves you stuttering and shivering. 

Was there ever a time before in your entire life when you felt anything like this?  //No,// you instantly reply.  Not even in your wildest wank fantasies could you imagine the pleasure of being on the receiving end of your sister’s masterful tongue-work. 

This was by its nature a new experience, and one so mind blowingly revolutionary you fear you may never be able to recover from it.

Julie wipes your juices from her lips with the back of her hand and runs her tongue over her full lips to clean the remainder.  “Oh damn!” Julie sighs when she picks up her flashing phone.  “My boyfriend is already waiting for me outside.  I have to go but we are definitely doing this again.  It was nice to meet...and taste you, Tammy~ Bye!”

Without another word, Julie dashes out of the room.

//Oh man… I need help.  Serious help.//

Fucking hell!  I would rather die than have sex with Julie!”  //Except I almost did just that...god damnit!//  You didn’t self destruct when your sister was between your legs licking your vagina, although you definitely fear that you came close.

You fall asleep in your own bed.

The next morning you dig deep into your closet and find a few articles of clothing you outgrew or once felt were too tight.  You are momentarily thankful your modest chest isn’t larger and that you had always been “blessed” with a slender frame.  You fit into an old T-shirt and shorts and use a scrunchie you find under your bed to put your hair in a ponytail.  //Hmm… I actually feel a bit better without the baggy clothes...//

“No, the truth is I uh…”  You mentally finish your sentence with “I am Taylor” and then imagine the inevitable reaction.  //Fuck it might be hard to make Julie see reason...there is definitely something wrong with her!  And with me!  Fuck!//

“I love your perfume,” Julie compliments your non existent fragrance with lidded eyes.

//What the fuck?//  “I am not wearing any…”

“Of course you are...I can like...totally smell you from a mile away...//in a good way//.”  Your sister breathes in deeply like inhaling from a rose.  Her actions and proximity make you deeply uncomfortably and put you on your guard.

“Uhh…[[Julie we have to talk]]...//about Taylor.//”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="633" name="Julie we have to talk" tags="" position="6589,8105" size="100,100">“Pfft!  Unless you are going to tell me you broke up with him, I don&#39;t want to hear it!  Wait--I don’t see him here...//you were waiting for me!//  Ah-ha!” Julie concludes.

“No...uh...you are misunderstanding!”  You try and frantically explain yourself to Julie but she just ignores you, steadily pressing forward into your personal space until you can feel her breath on your lips.

“No, I don’t think I am,” Julie firmly disagrees with a mischievous smile gracing her full lips.  “I am great at reading signals...you are an open page, Tammy.  I can see your lewd writing...I know what you are up to.”

“W-what did you say?”  //My...lewd writing?  What the fuck does that even mean!?//

“You and I are going to become very good friends,” Julie predicts.  “The best kind of friends.  //Lovers.//”

Your jaw drops.  //What the fuck has gotten into Julie!?  Sure, she has always been a bit promiscuous but this is on a whole new level!//

[[Try and repel Julie]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="634" name="Try and repel Julie" tags="" position="6737,8151" size="100,100">You try and resist, to push Julie away, but you soon find your strength evaporating under your sister’s determined assault.

You have to stop this before things get too out of hand… again.

“Julie!” you begin breathlessly protest but that is all you manage to say.  Julie soon smothers you with her soft, red petting lips.  “Oh no...no..no.. no…” you whimper, each word fainter than the last.  You feel yourself falling away again, sliding down a familiar slippery slope.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sisterkiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
“Julie…Uhnnn!!”  Your sister doesn’t let you speak.  She kisses you a hundred times, then a hundred times more with more teeth and tongue, running her hot breath and tender oral caresses up and down your neck and collarbone until you feel like you might just melt away and die from a combination of embarrassment, guilt, and a yearning you struggle desperately to suppress.

All you can do is squeak when Julie begins to tug at your shirt while licking at your burning, no-doubt bright red ears.

You blink twice and manage to push Julie an inch away.  “I have a confession to make!” you suddenly shout.

Julie stops mid lick.  “Yes?”

Your mind is so muddled.  You can’t //quite// seem to find the right words.  Eventually, you decide that the best approach is to be direct.

[[“I am your... brother!”]]
[[“Your tongue is amazing.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="635" name="kick yourself out of your funk." tags="" position="13153,16450" size="100,100">You decide to stop neglecting your schooling.  You drag yourself to a few classes but find the exercise pointless.  You are physically present but your mind is permanently preoccupied elsewhere.

After wasting a few days at school you decide to take some time off.  Yet instead of sleeping and recovering like your body wishes, you find the silence at home to be unbearable and soon head out partying in an effort to get shit faced for minimal cost.

Luckily, since your transformation such a goal is easily attained.  Your new, much lighter body seems to get intoxicated quickly and cheaply - a trait which a broke university student like yourself enormously appreciates.

You go into the closest bar and without fail someone buys you a drink within five minutes.  One leads to another, and soon you are blissfully drunk.  You talk to a lot of people and they all seem interesting.  You notice something unusual as well: normally in these situations as an introvert you would feel drained by the end of a such a night….yet now, with every person you speak to, you seem to gain a small burst of energy.  //What the fuck?  Were Myers and Briggs full of shit?  Was I always an extrovert in waiting?//

At some point you spot Evan drinking with Jimmy and another young man you don’t recognise.  “Hey guys!” you shout at them [[as you sit down with them.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="636" name="as you sit down with them." tags="" position="13017,16548" size="100,100">“Uh.  Hey Taylor!  Where you been lately?  Playing hookey?” Evan teases you.

“Just been dealing with shit...obviously,” you explain with a glare at Evan.  “I figure since everything is already fucked up I might as well be too.”

“Yeah, you don’t look like you are feeling well.  You are all pale.  Have you been sleeping?”  Evan seems genuinely concerned over your health.

“Sleep is for lazy and dead people,” you reply.  “And you are actually wrong… I feel pretty fucking great...for now at least.”

“If you say so…”

“Depending where I end up tonight, mind if I crash at your place if it is closer?”

“No, go nuts, back door is always open when we are home.” 

“Thanks, you’re awesome!  Okay- now a round of shots and then this ...Taylor is going to wander!”

“Are you referring to yourself in the third person now?”  Evan raises an eyebrow but buys a round of shots.

“Third person?  Maybe there is something to that.  Who I was.  Who I am...who I will be…”

“What?”

“Nothing!  Thanks for the Drink, Evan.  [[I appreciate it.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="637" name="I appreciate it." tags="" position="13155,16599" size="100,100">The rest of the night passes by in a flash.  A few hours later, you stumble out of a random house party on the opposite side of campus.

“Holy….shit….I think I drank too much….” you note as you brace yourself against a streetlight to steady the spinning world.  Your efforts are ineffective.

//Fuuuck….//  You doubt you can sleep given how suddenly ill you feel, but you decide it is best to get to a safe place to spend the night.

“Ugh...I am so glad I didn’t stick around some of those creeps…”

With a full moon settling in the night sky and a chill breeze blowing in from the North, you decide to go to Evan’s place since it is closer.

A few minutes of unsteady walking later, you slip into Evan’s house via the back door.  You help yourself to a glass of water and stand in the kitchen while debating your next actions.

You can see the dim outline of the couch in the living room, the most obvious place to pass out.  “Hmm…” you suddenly find your hands roaming over your warm, tingling body.  “Fuck...I am so horny…”  You know it is best to tamp down your emotions and try and sleep but your body doesn’t quite seem to agree.  You stare at the couch.  //Fuck I bet they will wake me up at like 7am too...//  Another idea occurs to you.  //I could sleep in the basement!  That way I could pass out and sleep off what will no doubt be a shitty hangover tomorrow.//

You decide to:
[[Sleep on the couch]]
[[Go downstairs and sleep]]
[[Go to Evan’s room]]
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="638" name="Sleep on the couch" tags="" position="12892,17735" size="100,100">You decide to sleep on the couch.  You lie down and close your eyes, eventually falling into a fitful sleep.  You wake up a few hours later when you hear Evan clanging around making breakfast.

With a mumbled thank you for his hospitality, you stumble out of Evan’s house and make your way home.  You spend the next part of the day retching above the toilet.  Such a gross experience would normally make you abstain from drinking for an extended period.  Yet now, in the cold, stark reality of the day you find your sober time to be almost unbearable.  Although it seems disgusting, you go out and get drunk that very night, and the next as well.

You fade into a liver destroying but fun routine.

A month goes by and you find yourself rarely if ever bothering to attend class.

Near the end of October, you glance at your phone’s many missed messages and decide to ignore your friend&#39;s texts.

You look at your dwindling stash that you have tried unsuccessfully to ration.  Soon you are strung out, miserable and drugless...standing in front of a familiar doorstep.

[[Knock on the door]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="639" name="Go downstairs and sleep" tags="" position="13595,16800" size="100,100">Since it is still so hot upstairs you decide to head to the basement.  You should be able to sleep better in the cool darkness without risk of getting woken up at 7am by the morning hangover zombies searching for food.

As you step down into the basement, you notice someone already sleeping on the futon.  You silently curse and flop onto the small loveseat.  Luckily you are a lot smaller now and you manage to stretch out comfortably.

As you do so, the figure on the bed says, “Who’s there?”

You recognize Tim in the darkness, his black skin making it difficult for you to completely make out his features in the poor light.

“Just me, uh...Taylor… Evan said I could pass out here.&quot;

&quot;Cool!  I am Tim.&quot;

&quot;Hi Tim.  I am going to sleep right here if that’s cool.”

“There is a lot more room right here,” Tim jokes.

You fumble around and manage to turn on a lamp.  You see [[Tim is patting the bedside next to him]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="640" name="Go to Evan’s room" tags="" position="13248,16794" size="100,100">You lie down briefly but find sleep elusive.  You decide to check in on Evan.  //Maybe he is still up...// you hope as you head upstairs.

You knock softly on Evan’s door and he doesn’t respond.  You rap a little louder and then open the door when you hear Evan inside.

“Hey, Evan!  What’s going on…”  You lose your train of thought as your eyes focus on Evan… and the cock he is holding in his hand.  “S-Sorry!” you stammer.

“Taylor!?”  Evan shouts at you as you turn away.  “Wait!”

“I am sorry for interrupting!” you apologize.  “I thought you said I could come in.”

“It is okay.  What’s up?” Evan asks you as he casually pulls up his pants.

“Not much… I am just going to go back downstairs,” you awkwardly answer.

“Oh come on.  You came up here for a reason.”

“Yeah, I was bored and couldn’t sleep.”

“Well you don’t have to be!  How drunk are you?”

You think about the question for a moment and do an internal appraisal.  “Fairly drunk,” you admit.

Evan smiles.  He pats the bedside next to him.

You laugh.  “In your dreams, buddy.”

“This could be a dream…  It is late and night and a beautiful babe comes to my room.  Hmm, what could happen next?”

“That does sound fairly “dream like,”” you agree.

“How about a dream blow job?” Evan suggests jokingly.  Or at least you hope he is joking...

“Hah.  In your //real// dreams!”

Evan sighs in disappointment.  “So, you want to play a game or something?”

[[“Sure.  That would be sweet!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="641" name="I bet you will too." tags="" position="12985,19104" size="100,100">
“Uh…”  You can feel your pussy is overflowing onto the bed in anticipation of the rough fucking you are no doubt about to receive.

Mitch grins evilly at you for a moment.  He then flips you around and positions his cock in front of your vagina.

“Say it.”

You don’t ask for clarification.  Your best resistance is to wait but a few seconds before submission.  “Whatever!  Just...fuck… I am your slut, Mitch.”  //At least for now.//  “Please fuck my pussy!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchpre.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1011px&quot; height=&quot;758px&quot;&gt;
“Well, since you asked so nicely…” Mitch slowly pushes forward, filling the aching void inside you to completion.

Mitch fucks you with a beastial intensity in a sex session that goes on for hours.  By the time Mitch is done with you, you can barely stand, let alone walk.  Mitch’s cum drips from your used, puckered pussy and asshole.  You are more than sore but drugs, endorphins and strange hormones you understand little about have dulled your pain.  Much to your shame, you [[came more often than Mitch did.]]

You shower and throw yourself on your bed.  Falling asleep is difficult, for your mind becomes tormented by a host of evil, self loathing thoughts.

The next morning you go to class and suffer through the day.  Just as you are leaving campus, you receive a text from Mitch ordering you over early.

“Fuck… I am turning into this asshole’s slave,” you lament as your feet turn towards Mitch’s apartment.  With a heavy heart, you head up to experience another round of demented, pleasurable self destruction.

You let yourself in to Mitch’s place and nearly trip over a comically large pair of shoes.  You hear voices in the living room.  Apparently Mitch is not alone.

“Hey, Taylor, you know Gil, right?”

“Uh...yeah…” you respond.  You find it difficult to return Gil’s overeager stare and wolfish grin.

//Fucking Gil…I hate this douchebag!//  Gil was a typical brutish thug that had used his commanding stature and athletic prowess to become very popular.  He also used his dominance at sports as an excuse to neglect his mind.  Gil was dumb as a box of rocks and his association with Mitch made you one of their frequent targets for bullying.

“Yo, Taylor grab us a couple beers!” Mitch shouts at you.

You bring them each a beer.  “Great.  [[Now suck me and Gil off,]]” Mitch casually orders you.

It is easier to do the clasps in the front than reaching behind your back.  Then just spin it around and pull the cups up … and //voila!//”

Your eyes return to the mirror.  A beautiful woman wearing a bra, ample cleavage on display, peers back at you.  If you were alone you would probably be a bit turned on.

You feel slightly constricted but well supported.  You stand up and jump.  You do feel a bit more comfortable.  //As long as this thing isn’t too tight…//  

“Ah, fuck I am wearing a bra…” you say in disbelief.  //Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck!  Why!?//

“And it looks great on you.”

“Ughhh….” you groan at the compliment.

“Now how about some underwear?” Julie suggests.

“No!  Just...please leave me some.  I will try it on later...this is all a bit overwhelming for me.”

“Sure, no problem,” your sister agrees.  “I got some new and gently used things in my room.  I will give you some booty shorts but mostly it will be panties I am afraid.  You had better get used to it I think.”

&quot;I will never get used to this.&quot;

“See, not so bad?” Hulie says once you have a pair of panties held in hand.

“Thanks for the “help,” sis,” you reply sarcastically.

“Anytime, //sis,//” she teases you back.

When your sister finally leaves you alone, you drift off to your own devices, searching the internet in vain for a cure.

The next day...

[[Go to school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="646" name="bright red painted fingernails." tags="" position="12243,21008" size="100,100">“Um.  That’s...uh... nice I suppose?”  //Did she just call me a “project?”  What a bitch!//

“Glad you like it.  We are doing yours next!” Julie announces.

“Like fucking hell we are.  What possible purpose could there be to me … doing… //that?//”

Your sister sighs.  “We already went through this!  It makes you feel good and look pretty!”

“How will putting that gross smelling goo on my fingers make me feel good?  I already feel nauseous!”

“C’mon!  You are going to do this for me,” Julie half implores, half commands you to agree.

“[[Uh...no, I am not,]]” you refuse.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="647" name="Uh...no, I am not," tags="" position="12388,21096" size="100,100">“//Or else.//”

“What the fuck, Julie?”  Your sister stares at you with her penetrating, dark eyes, daring you to question her.  “No fucking way!  “Or else?” fucking wow…  What are you going to do?  Threaten me with a lifetime in a university laboratory freezer?  What kind of sister are you?”

“Oh no… what I have planned for you is //much// worse than that.”

You gulp.  “Much worse than…?”  Your mind briefly images several potentially gruesome fates.

“So you going to sit in the chair for like ten minutes and get your nails painted like a good girl?  Or do I have to get nasty?”

“W-what were you going to do?” you ask Julie as you grudgingly sit in the chair.

“Call mom,” your sister replies.  You cringe.  That would indeed be a very fucked up conversation that could be one for the fucked up hall of fame.  Since your transformation, you have been grateful your mother has been placated with the occasional text message and email.  You doubt your luck will hold out for long.  You imagine sitting down and explaining to your parents that you transformed into a woman and have no idea how to turn back...or [[what caused the transformation in the first place.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="648" name="what caused the transformation in the first place." tags="" position="12248,21150" size="100,100">“Mom //cannot// find out.”

“She won’t hear a thing from me!  Now hands out!” Julie chirps as she pulls out a bottle of ruby red nail polish.  The chemical smell assaults your nose as Julie begins to gently paint your nails with a delicate, little brush.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/nails.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Having your nails painted isn&#39;t directly unpleasant...it is just fucking weird.  //Men shouldn’t have their nails painted...but just what the hell am I, anyway?  Fuck, my head hurts.//

&quot;Alright!&quot; Julie shouts once your nails are painted.  Now that we look lovely - it is time to shop!&quot;

[[You silently wish for death]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="649" name="You silently wish for death" tags="" position="12388,21248" size="100,100">You and Julie walk to the mall.  You keep your eyes peeled for danger but sense none and notice nothing out of the ordinary.  As you glance at Julie, you correct yourself, //She is the only weirdo I need to watch out for today!//

Julie leads you into the mall and then walks straight into the girliest shop you have ever seen.  Even the shop’s name, //La Femme// is written in bright pink.  

“I am not going in there,” you balk.  “None of this shit is my style,” you argue as you glance distastefully at a pink tutu in the display window.

“Hmm?  Your //style?//”  Julie rolls her eyes as she looks you over from head to toe.  “How about: “lack thereof?””

“Julie, do we have to keep having the same damned conversation every time we talk?  I am not a girl, //and// I don’t want to look like one!”

Julie laughs at you.  “Mhmm!  //But// everyone wants to feel and look good.  You admitted it.  Plus you owe me, Taylor.  Don’t be a wuss.  It is just a little dress up.  And you get free clothes!  That is just //soooo awful!//  Plus you are already painted and braided, why not get a cute outfit to complete the ensemble?”

“I hate you //so// much right now.”

“Nooo!  You //love// me!”

“Ahhh!”  You manage to just barely recover and avoid driving directly into a muddy bog.

//I wish Ryan wasn’t so fucking close...// you think while another part of you desires him closer still.  You wage your internal battle as you climb high into the mountain forests.

Eventually Ryan taps you on your shoulder and points to a nearby meadow.

Eager to recover some stamina, you steer into the beautiful clearing and hop off the ATV.

“Oh wow!  There is a lake down here too!  So...pretty!” you comment [[as you admire the spot.]]

“I look like...a fucking anime character or something...holy shit…”

With increasing ease, you make your face more heart shaped.  You will your eyes to become rounder and wider and they do.  It isn’t long before you look like a completely different person...again.

“Boobs...boobs...boobs…” you mumble as you redline with excitement.  Your chest swells, expanding to proportions that make you blush and nearly topple over.

After your discovery and a bit of messing around with different slight appearance alterations, you finally come to your senses.  //What the fuck am I doing!?  This is insane!  Wait...am I nuts?//  Maybe that was truly it.  //But insane people don’t actually //know// they are insane, right?//  Perhaps you are just living within some mad delusion but your eerie nightmare has gone on for far too long to be some kind of dream.  No matter how much you play with your chest, you cannot shake the delightful sensations of your touch on the soft, sensitive skin of your new mounds.  You pinch your nipples a coax an unintentionally sexy moan from your mouth.  //These are definitely real.  This is all fucking real.//  You’re not fucking crazy but the whole might be instead. 

You admire your large chest for far too long and eventually you begin to feel a pressure, like a twinge of muscle fatigue.  You close your eyes and attempt to reverse your changes.  You try and imagine your breasts shrinking.  //Go back to normal...//you will.  After finally managing to focus, you feel your breasts slightly deflate.

Once your modest breasts have returned to their original form you feel relieved.  //Fuck...not a good sign I consider these Bs to be my “normal.”  Shit!  I never had the manliest chest but ….aghhgh...I shouldn’t have ANY breasts!//  The joy of your fantastic discovery is blunted.

“Hmm…”  The idea did had its appeal.  //But I would still be a woman...just mannish…// Such a transformation, while being familiar would still have its disadvantages.  Being an attractive man or woman seemed to be very beneficial.  Being a plain guy wasn’t the greatest but you imagine being an ugly guy would suck a lot more.  But being an ugly girl?  Somehow that was even worse!

//Both men and women seem to value a woman’s looks a little too highly...// You sigh.  You find yourself included in that tally.  “I guess I will stay like this...for now.  Besides it felt kind of weird after a while with those larger breasts…”  //Fuck!  Now I am thinking about boobs again.// Maybe you are hopeless, destined to reside in some fucked up alternate reality where you are destined to submit at least in some level to your many perversions.  “Still...I had better be careful who I tell about this.

The secret at the center seems aloof and mysterious.  //Fuck!  What the hell is going on?//

Your strange abilities were clearly caused by a mental stimulus.  For a glorious moment, you really felt like you were on the verge of an even greater breakthrough.  //I bet I can change into a man if I concentrate enough...//  The idea seemed more than a tad absurd but you cannot shake the eery certainty that you could transform into //anything// if only you had the mental and physical stamina to withstand the discomfort.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="655" name="See what Drew is up to instead and call it a night" tags="" position="7197,17305" size="100,100">You text Drew wondering when he will be released.  He responds a few minutes later explaining that they are letting him out tomorrow.

“Going to be laid down for a while but should make a full recovery,” he adds.  “What about you, Taylor?  Seen anything suspicious?  I hope you are keeping your guard up.”  His concern over your safety makes you sigh. 

“No men in black thankfully,&quot; you answer.  &quot;I will come by and visit you tomorrow if that is okay.”

“Of course, just make sure you are VERY careful on the way over,” Drew replies.

“I will wear a disguise,” you text in reply.  “Weird...I could actually maybe do just that…I will try and alter my appearance so I don’t get caught!  Fuck I am so smart sometimes!” [[you praise yourself.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="656" name="Search the internet for ways to improve your mental stamina" tags="" position="6827,16903" size="100,100">You decide that learning more about how to control your mysterious abilities should take priority over recreation.

You sit down at your computer and do a double take when you glance at the screen.

“What the hell?”  //Someone changed my desktop background to a weird logo!?//  A pink Trans Corp international logo now decorates your PC.

“Trans Corp!?  These assholes have infected my computer!  And… my mind.”  You look down at your breasts and add, “My body too…  If they are responsible for all this BS I am going to burn down their fucking corporate HQ,” you vow.

You have had enough of dancing to the whims of others.  It was time to write your own story and change the score.  //I need to get my life back!//

You ignore your distasteful background image and begin searching the net.  

Within a few minutes, you have [[jotted down several relaxation and concentration tips.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="657" name="you praise yourself." tags="" position="7049,17401" size="100,100">You see a familiar looking white box lying in the middle of the hallway.  //What the fuck?  Is Julie leaving these for me to find!?  ...Or just to trip over?//  “Cowper’s Cosplay…” you read the label.  //I wonder if Julie got another maid outfit to replace the one I took...//

You can’t seem to stop yourself from opening the box and peeking at its contents.  Inside is what appears to be a nurse uniform...a //sexy// nurse uniform.  You cannot stop your next thought either, //This might be just what Drew needs!  … Fuck!  Why is that the first thing that pops into my head?//  You briefly recall your moment of role play as Taylor the Maid.  You suddenly feel nervous.  You also note a strange tingle coming from between your legs.  The idea of dressing up probably shouldn’t turn you on but it does.  You also liked cute costumes...you just never expected to wear any yourself.  A woman’s clothing had never interested you as much as her other “attributes.”  You are a surely man inside and yet you still undeniably want to try on on the stupid dress.  //It isn’t like that is anything weird, right?  It is for Drew’s sake!  Well, mostly...Er..Fuck...God damnit Taylor!  Get ahold of yourself!// 

“Aghh…”  You balance the weight of your debt, your burdensome feelings of guilt against the embarrassment and weirdness of wearing such an outfit for Drew.  [[You find the equation firmly slanted in Drew’s favour.]]  “Fuck…I am really doing this...”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="658" name="You find the equation firmly slanted in Drew’s favour." tags="" position="7193,17455" size="100,100">You knock on your sister’s door.

“Hey...Julie…”

“Yes, Taylor?”

You step into her room.  “Uh...can I...may I please borrow...//this?//” you request.  Julie studies you and the box you are holding for a moment.  She then bursts out laughing.

“Bahahahahahahaahahahah!  Holy fuck, Taylor!  I knew you wouldn’t be able to stop with the maid outfit!  Dressing up is just too much fun, right?  ….Especially if it is for //someone special.//”  You find yourself blushing at your sister’s words.  “So, who are you dressing up for?” Julie enquires.  “Is that weirdo Evan paying you to cosplay for him?  You are both such fuckin’ pervs.”

//That explanation would probably make a lot more sense than what I am actually doing...//

“It is just for [[uh...research,]]” you respond.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="659" name="uh...research," tags="" position="7049,17553" size="100,100">“Mhmm, oh-so-sexy research.  Gotcha!” Julie says while rolling her eyes.  “Speaking of //research//, do you even care about finding out what happened to you?”

“Of course I fucking care!  It is just--”  //It seems men in black suits or white coats are destined to abduct me...//  “Things have just been weird.  There is crazy shit happening, Julie!  Not just to me but maybe even the whole country- the whole planet even!”  Julie raises an eyebrow and gives you a pitying smile.  “Julie!  I am serious!  There are ...people out to get me!  You should be wary too!  Be wary of well dressed men!” you warn your sister.

“Taylor, you are so weird sometimes.  I //love// well dressed men.”

“God-damnit Julie!  This is a matter of life and death.”

Julie giggles.  “Take your nurse outfit and have fun with your new boyfriend.  Maybe //Nurse Taylor// can save his life...He-he!”

Your mouth falls open at the word “boyfriend.”  You leave Julie’s room without another word.  //Why the fuck would she think I have...or want a...//boy//friend--fuck!//  You suddenly remember Mrs. Drachmann’s words in the hospital.

“Uaaaaahhhhhhhghg!” you howl as you attempt to repress all your unproductive, horribly clashing thoughts.  “I am definitely going to go nuts unless I find a way to return to my old self...and soon.”

//I already have the costume...it would be a shame to let it go to waste, right?//  “I am going to come over tomorrow.  I got something that might cheer you up,” [[you text Drew.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="660" name="you text Drew." tags="" position="7189,17643" size="100,100">The next day you wake up feeling groggy.

“Whooaa…” you say as you sit up in bed.  The world subtly spins around you.  //Fuck...//  You almost feel drunk.  A hand darts to your forehead.  The flesh is sweaty and blazing hot.

“What the hell?  Am I getting sick?”  That would be awful timing. Suddenly another, more disturbing idea occurs to you.   //Uh oh...what if this is a possible side effect of my discovery?//

You drag yourself into the bathroom and are about to turn on the shower when you change your mind.  You stretch out your slender limbs and cup [[your now aching breasts.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="661" name="and then dash to your room" tags="" position="7200,17800" size="100,100">You dress in your usual T-shirt and a pair of borrowed jeans.  As you slide the tight fitting fabric around your waist, you inwardly cringe at how tight Julie’s pants feel around your ass.  //Fuck or are these all women’s clothes?//  You silently add finding some better clothes to your mental to-do list.

You grab the cosplay box and are about to set out when you suddenly remember your disguise.

//Fuck...but what if it gives me another fever tomorrow?  I don’t want to fucking die or burst into flames!//  You needed to do more experimentation, but not necessarily at this very moment.  Your minor transformations literally made your skin crawl.  The sensations were not something you wanted to experience frequently or get used to.

You bite your lip, mulling over the potential dangers.  It seems you continually walk upon a knife’s edge.  You could be making a fatal misstep with every minor decision.

//Fuck!//  “What the hell should I do?”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="662" name="your now aching breasts." tags="" position="7047,17706" size="100,100">“I am going to have a bath instead,” you decide.  You put the plug in the drain and begin to run hot water.  As you do so your eyes fall on Julie’s aromatic candles.

“Maybe it will help my nausea....” you say as you grab a lighter from the drawer.  Soon the sweet, sensual aroma of strawberries and roses fills the room. 

You take a deep breath of the fragrant air and slip into the warm water.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bathtime.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The warm water envelopes you and leeches away all your worries.  You close your eyes and enjoy the stress relief.  Your life has been entirely too fucked up lately.  You definitely needed this.

After the water becomes cool and your flesh prunish, you drain the water and dry off [[and then dash to your room]].  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="663" name="Use a transformative disguise and travel to Drew’s" tags="" position="12095,18043" size="100,100">You decide not to risk getting abducted by men in black.  You step back into the bathroom and stare at the mirror.  

“Okay...longer...longer hair!  Yes…”  You feel your scalp tingle and, a moment later, you feel your hair spill down your back.  “Whoa ...that was more than I expected…”  

You feel a bit nauseous but stubbornly push on.  “Okay...black...I want black hair...yes…”  Your hair colour shifts from brown to the colour of coal.

“Now maybe just make my face look a little bit...yes… like that…”  You bring a finger to your nose and push, and your nose shifts, upturning slightly, giving you a vaguely porcine look.

You giggle at your reflection.  You look super ugly but figure it is the perfect disguise.

[[With your appearance altered, you leave the house.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="664" name="Forego transformation and cautiously take the back streets to Drew’s place" tags="" position="6345,17951" size="100,100">You decide not to use your new ability without a pressing need.  You have been safe recently and perhaps this fact has made you a little too confident.

You head out your backdoor and duck into a midsection between housing blocks.  You jog forward and head down a back alley and then cut through an adjacent park.  You are about halfway to Drew&#39;s house when suddenly you run past a van blocking most of the roadway. 

&quot;Watch where ya are fackin&#39; going!&quot; shouts a man unloading a box from the back of the van.

&quot;I am sorry!&quot;  you apologize as you awkwardly jog away.

At the end of the alley you suddenly have your worst fears realized.

&quot;Oh shit!&quot; you screech, nearly having a heart attack as you spot a man wearing a suit and sunglasses walking towards you and blocking your path forward. 

Your body reacts before you can think, you throw your cosplay box at the man&#39;s face.  You then spin on your heel and run back the way you came.  The man in the suit chases after you but your headstart gives you a slight edge.  You run until your leg muscles burn.  When you reach the street you glance left and right.  You don&#39;t want to lead them back to your home unnecessarily.  So you look in the remaining direction, to your right you can just barely make out the hulking structure of the mall complex that is next to the University&#39;s south side.  //The mall!  That is perfect!//  You run towards the mall with [[renewed stamina and determination.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="665" name="With your appearance altered, you leave the house." tags="" position="11943,18097" size="100,100">On the walk over you stay off the main street for the most part and cut through a few back alleys.  You barely see anyone, let alone a squadron of men in black hunting you down.  When you arrive near Drew’s place, you slip into a nearby burger joint.  //I owe Drew a burger too...//  You recall the moment Drew and the secret service wannabe agent collided.  //Err...maybe I owe him a year of free burgers...//

“Hello, I will take the mega bacon burger with extra-extra-extra bacon,” you say to the young lady at the till.

“That’s Drew’s order!” the woman exclaims.

You laugh.  “Yeah...he got kind of hurt...I am going to bring him one of his favourites.&quot;

“That is so sweet of you!  I saw what happened the other day - that was nuts!  What a crazy man!”

“I know, right?  Crazy world we live in...”

Five minutes later you are walking up the steps to Drew’s home with a greasy burger bag clenched in hand and an awkwardly balanced cosplay box in the other.

You relax your features and reverse your transformation.  The process makes you feel relieved.  Suppressing a shiver, you knock twice and let yourself in.

“Taylor?  Is that you?  Wait...is that….IS THAT A QUADRUPLE BACON BURGER!?” Drew shouts his question at you as soon as the burger smell hits his nostrils.

“Yes and yes.  This bad boy has your name on it.&quot;  You walk to the living room where Drew is awkwardly lying on the couch and hand him the grease-stained bag.

“OH MY GOD.  This is just what I needed.  You are the best, Taylor!  I feel rejuvenated already.”

You look at Drew’s foam neck brace and his bruised face and [[find it a bit hard to agree with his assessment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="666" name="find it a bit hard to agree with his assessment." tags="" position="12091,18195" size="100,100">“I can’t believe you came all the way here just to cheer me up.  I feel so lucky.”  Drew inhales the burger aroma with a look of bliss as he opens the bag.

You frown at Drew.  “You basically took a bullet for me, I owe you more than a couple burgers!  I didn’t come here just to bring you some food.  I will be right back,” you say mysteriously and slip away.

You grab the cosplay box from near the entrance and step into the bathroom.  You strip down and drape the revealing costume over yourself.  You start with the stockings, pulling them over your heels and up your legs.  The white fabric tightly grips your legs and feels like a second skin.  You briefly admire your legs and backside in the mirror.  

“Hmm?”  You pull two strange leather objects from the box.  “Um…” you stare at the curious looking garments, not sure precisely what to call them.  “I am pretty sure these are leggings...seems a bit weird to wear them on top of stockings but they seem to go with the costume.&quot;  You tug them on and spend a full tend minutes awkwardly lacing them up.

Next you put on the actual dress.  “What the hell?  Fuck!” you remark in distress.  The nurse costume hangs off you.  The padded bra in the box is enormous.  The bust and leggings are clearly meant for a woman of vastly different sizes.  You figure the store must have made a mistake.  “There is no way this would fit Julie...or me…hmmm...”  Your surprise appears to be ruined.  “Wait! Or not...Holy shit maybe I can make this work.”

“Okay boobies...//big// boobies…”  You imagine yourself with a much fuller chest.  You will it to be true, for your Bs to grow to Cs.  The strange sensation from your previous experiments returns - the icy chill battles the swelling hotness until you manage to enlarge your breasts at least one full size.

“Holy fuck that never gets old…[[this is amazing.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="667" name="this is amazing." tags="" position="11943,18261" size="100,100">Yet your nurse costume still hangs off you.  You will your breasts to grow further and then gradually shift your focus to other areas of your body.  Your ass and thighs thicken until you almost look like a completely different person.  

“Wow…”  You stare at the mirror.  A total fucking babe stares back.  “Holy shit...I am naughty nurse…” You repeat that last part a few times and chuckle.  “Heck yeah!  I am a naughty nurse!’

“You know what you need, Drew?” you ask your friend from the darkness of the hallway.

“Uh, what?”

“My friend, Taylor the Maid, gave me the number of a friend….//Nurse// Taylor,” you introduce yourself as you step into the living room where Drew can see you in all your glory.

Drew blinks rapidly and sputters incoherently for at least a full minute.  “Your chest!  What happened!?” he finally manages to ask you.  You cannot help but laugh at his reaction.

“Just a little transformation,” you reply nonchalantly, as if it isn’t a big deal.  “Anything is possible these days it seems.”

“What!?  You can change...your f-figure...and your b-boobs…?”

“Yep!  Just discovered the trick actually.  It hurts a bit but it is totally worth it, right?”

“You did this….for me?”

“Of course,” you answer.  “[[You’re my best friend.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="668" name="You’re my best friend." tags="" position="12095,18343" size="100,100">“Taylor...you shouldn’t feel obligated to do this.  I don’t want you to be in pain!  You don’t owe me anything.  We… are ...//friends…//”  Drew mutters the last word as if he wishes it wasn’t true.

“It is okay...I want to dress up for you…”  //Sort of...//  “Please, Drew, I already feel like shit.  At least let me look after you.  //Please.//”

“Okay,” Drew agrees with a sigh.  You are surprised how suddenly he reverses course and accepts your offer.

Drew paws at his neck brace and groans.  You walk over to him and help him remove the brace.  He winces and grinds his teeth in pain as he tries to move around and stretch his limbs.

“Drew, you’re obviously sore…And you probably shouldn’t take that off yet.”

“Taylor, don’t worry, it is fine.  A little oil on my joints and this tin-man is good to go,” Drew jokes.

Drew awkwardly shambles around while his hand travels around his body to prod spots of evident pain.  Drew’s display just reminds you of how his condition is almost entirely your fault.

“Drew, lie down,” you command.  “I am going to give you a massage.  Nurse’s order!  [[It is the least I can do,” you suddenly offer.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="669" name="renewed stamina and determination." tags="" position="6489,18009" size="100,100">You manage to make it inside the mall and breath a sigh of relief at the crowded shops.  You even note a security guard standing nearby.

You try and hide in the crowd, moving forward to mingle amongst the densest groups.

You wander the mall for a tense half hour.  Just when you are sure you&#39;ve lost your pursuers, you spot a man wearing sunglasses and a familiar cut of suit.  //Fuck me...only assholes and secret agents wear sunglasses indoors!//

Luckily, the man does not appear to acknowledge your presence.

You woodenly walk forward and breathe a sigh of relief when the suit walks by you apparently oblivious to your presence.  //Oh thank fuck… my paranoia is going to get the best of me!  Or...it will save my fucking life!// you think as you spot a fucking squadron of men in dark suits moving towards you.  You glance back and see the first man you dismissed standing nearby and blocking any hope of retreat.  

//FUCK!  I am trapped!//  You look around and spot the door to the women&#39;s restroom.  You quickly decide you either have to make a run for it or maybe try and convince some of the crowd that these guys are trying to abduct you or something.

With your heart thundering in your chest, you decide to:

[[Dash into the bathroom and attempt to change your appearance in order to escape]]
[[Scream for help and make a big scene]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="670" name="Dash into the bathroom and attempt to change your appearance in order to escape" tags="" position="6345,18151" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to false&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $uglyb to true&gt;&gt;
Your surging adrenaline levels force you into a state of temporary panic as you internally debate whether to fight or flee.  Yet after a second, you find you are in motion.  You cease to think, you just simply //act//.  Your surroundings blur by you and a moment later you are inside the woman&#39;s washroom, staring at your reflection in the mirror. 

//I am trapped! … No- I am not!//  &quot;Please!  Please!&quot; you frantically beg your reflection.  &quot;Uh… //blonde!//  C&#39;mon!&quot;  //Blonde, blonde, blonde, BLONDE!//  When you finally manage to focus and calm your heaving chest, your hair gradually shifts colour.

&quot;Uh no that isn&#39;t enough!  I look the fucking same!  Ugly!  Yes!  I want to be fucking //ugly!//&quot;  You try and will yourself to become uglier but your face remains unchanged.  //Fuck I am running out of time here!//  &quot;C&#39;mon Taylor!  UGLY!  Concentrate, fuck!  Big nose...asymmetry...&quot;  You suddenly grab your cheek and press down, to your utter amazement your flesh becomes malleable like plasticine.  You begin to quickly twist, pull, and press your features apart until you look like a completely different person.

&quot;Holy fucking shit I //really// hope this works…&quot; you mutter under your breath as you step back into the mall [[as a very ugly blonde girl.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="671" name="Scream for help and make a big scene" tags="" position="6638,18059" size="100,100">Alt under construction.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="672" name="as a very ugly blonde girl." tags="" position="6489,18212" size="100,100">You count at least five men in suits with military bearing standing around the area.  They seem to have roughly cordoned off the area where you disappeared.  

//Please work!  I hope they don&#39;t recognize my clothes...//  With sweat dripping down the small of your back, you boldly stroll forward right between two of the suits and step out into the freedom of daylight.

After you are safely on the street you can&#39;t help but fist pump.  &quot;I made it!  Hah!  Fuck you assholes!&quot;

You take the long way home and try and avoid any unnecessary encounters.

When you finally arrive home you see [[a note taped to your front door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="673" name="a note taped to your front door." tags="" position="6345,18302" size="100,100">&quot;I have a bad feeling about this,&quot; you say as you inspect the note.

It reads: &quot;Call before it is too late!&quot; and then has a phone number scrawled underneath it.

You rip it off the door and glance around but notice nothing suspicious.

You have had enough of this stalker bullshit.  You take out your phone and dial the number.

A cheerful sounding woman answers on the first ring.  &quot;Hello!  Elmer&#39;s Fine Pastry Company at your service.  This is Sally speaking, how may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Uh…&quot;  Her upbeat attitude catches you off guard.  You take a second and quickly double check the number you dialed.  It appears to be correct.  //Is someone playing a prank on me?// you silently wonder as you try and reframe your angry demands into something a bit more polite.

&quot;Um, sorry...I might have the wrong number but I found this weird note on my door…&quot; you lamely try and explain.

&quot;Oh!  That&#39;s exciting!&quot; the woman response.  &quot;Is it one of our //special flyers?//&quot; 

&quot;No, it isn&#39;t a flyer...it is more like a… [[hand written note,]]&quot; you explain.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="674" name="Go to the shady meeting at the duck pond." tags="" position="6639,18720" size="100,100">You are clearly in danger but yet this meeting seems more //polite// than the men in black&#39;s previous methods.  //Are they switching their gameplan?

&quot;These assholes are obviously well informed...maybe they can tell me something useful for a change.&quot;  Your curiosity is suddenly too great to bear, so you decide to go to the meeting.  Time is of the essence, so you begin to jog in the direction of the park.  //Fuck I hope I am not meeting some axe-murderer or crazy person….or worse. //  

The duck pond finally appears in front of you and you quickly check your phone.  //Fuck 12:58!//  You wanted to have a moment to check out the place before committing but now you feel rushed.  You quickly scan the area and see a well dressed man in a red hat sitting exactly in the described location.

You let your new transformation fade and return to your base figure.

The man in the red cap ignores your question.  His child-like face lights up and his slightly chubby cheeks rise up into a delighted smile.  The man then stands, suddenly shocking you at his height as his gangly limbs stretch out.  His legs seem abnormally spindly, giving him the appearance of a human spider.  //Holy fuck is this guy like seven feet tall!?// Sure your perspective had been altered since your transformation, but this was clearly one of the tallest men you have ever encountered.  The man leans forward and eagerly studies your face.  &quot;Fascinating,&quot; he remarks.  &quot;Yes!  Truly //fascinating!//&quot;

&quot;Who the fuck are you!?&quot;

&quot;Forgive my rudeness!&quot; exclaims the tall man, before bowing before you.  &quot;I am called &quot;the Envoy,&quot;&quot; he introduces himself.  &quot;And you, //sir,// are Taylor Roux.&quot;

You blink.  //Fuck...I have a really bad feeling about all this...//  &quot;Are you with those--those asshole suits!?&quot; you shout your question, your tiny hands balling into shaking fists.

The strange man answers immediately.  &quot;No, no, no!  Just the opposite!&quot;  The Envoy raises two hands with exceptionally long fingers to forestall your protest.   &quot;I represent //the// Agency,&quot; the Envoy grandly announces, as if he expects his emphasis and vagueness to be impressive.

&quot;Uh…&quot; you groan.  //Fucking greeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaat just what I need.  [[Another shadowy fucking organization appears!]]  Fuck my life!//

You stare back at him somewhat incredulous but eventually sit down after a glance to confirm there are in fact several people nearby.  The potential witnesses make you feel marginally more comfortable and you decide it decreases the odds of you getting murdered or abducted by at least fifty percent.  You sigh.  The man doesn&#39;t appear to mean you any harm, but are well aware appearances can be often be mighty deceiving.  

&quot;This is you,&quot; the Envoy explains.  He takes out a folder from a nearby briefcase.  He opens it up, retrieves an item, throws down a photo of you entering the subway onto your lap.

//Fuck.//  You feel the small hairs at the back of your neck rise.  The photograph is very high resolution making you doubt it came from a mere security camera.

&quot;And here is you five minutes later,&quot; the Envoy continues, while laying down a second photo.  You look at the photo and your ugly blonde mug from your escape stares back at you.

Your mouth suddenly feels unusually dry.  You are about to deny his inference, when the Envoy preempts you.  &quot;This blonde has same height, same clothes, same build, same //ear-print// --and those are as recognizable as fingerprints by the way -- and those prints match the girl who went in -- they are yours.  Yet, when you exit, you look like a completely different person!  Very remarkable!  //They// had a hundred men involved in that capture operation [[and yet you walked right through them like a ghost!]]  Haha!  That is //marvelous!//&quot;

&quot;Um.&quot;  Your mind goes blank.  You doubt you can come up with a convincing lie even if you had all the time in the world.  You briefly mull over your options including punching Mr. Spiderman in the throat and running away.  Lying, escape, even simple negotiation seemed nearly impossible in your circumstances.

The Envoy fills the void in the silence.  &quot;Hey -- don&#39;t even try to deny it.  I am not a fucking moron.  //Trust me!//&quot; he insists with a sharp-toothed grin that makes you instinctively take a wary posture. &quot;I am not here to hurt you...I am here to //recruit  you.//&quot;

&quot;You...want to recruit //me?//&quot; you repeat the statement.

&quot;Yep!&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;Top secret!  For now at least.&quot;

&quot;And your spooky agency?  What are we talking here?  Super-villains?  Spies?  //Child-actors?//  Where do you guys fall on the &quot;evilness spectrum?&quot;&quot;

The Envoy chuckles.  &quot;I already know a lot about you, Mr. Roux, so I will use an analogy you will understand.  [[Our organization is True Neutral.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="679" name="entered into a god-damned spy novel" tags="" position="6495,19110" size="100,100">&quot;First things first: do you agree to join us?  Please bear in mind this is a lifetime commitment.  You can quit and freelance as you desire but you will not ever be able to join or aid one of our major competitors.  If you should deviate from this simple contract your life and earnings will be forfeit.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s… nice to know…&quot;  You swallow nervously as you mull over the threat.  You feel all of your pent up anxiety coalesce into a ball in the center of your stomach.

//Fuck...I guess I should ask for more time to think things over…//  You glance at the Envoy and his intense stare makes you think it is unlikely he would wait.  You note the only time the strange man seems to stop looking at you is to glance at his watch, as if implying your time is limited.  You feel incredibly nervous, as if you are walking along a tightrope.  Any misstep would leave to a deadly fall...and there appears to be only one course of action: to slowly move forward.

&quot;This is a one time offer, Mr. Roux.  Please make your decision.&quot;

&quot;How do I know I can trust you?&quot;

&quot;You have to make your own decisions.  I think it is plain our methods are more ...//tactful// than most of our competitors.  There are those that would have merely kidnapped your sister to ensure compliance rather than leave a note on your front door.  You have powerful enemies, Mr. Roux.  Perhaps it would be in your self interest to acquire some //allies?//&quot;

//Fuck.  He does have a point.//

I knew you were a smart fellow--//person.//  Normally our agency has absurdly strict hiring criteria but given your, ahem, //unique gifts// we are more than willing to make an exception and add you to our junior roster.&quot;

&quot;That is just fucking peachy.  Now, how about some of that secret info?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid it isn&#39;t //quite// so simple, young Taylor.  As a //probationary agent// you will have to complete at least one mission before you become a full member.&quot;

&quot;Fucking figures!  I knew there was a catch.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be so pessimistic!  I already had you pegged as a sensible ...person, so I have already prepared four suitable missions that would potentially benefit from your unique pallet of skills.&quot;

I think you and I will enjoy working together, Taylor.&quot;  The Envoy leans forward and retrieves another folder from his briefcase.  &quot;I love the open air,&quot; he remarks.  &quot;So much more enjoyable than a stuffy office!&quot;

You ignore the Envoy&#39;s awkward attempt at small talk.  &quot;What about the jobs?&quot;

&quot;I was already certain of your acceptance so I have pre-prepared four suitable missions.  The pay and danger levels vary but I am confident you are capable of completing all of them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t I need like...training or something?&quot;

&quot;I believe your //gift// will more than make up for your lack of experience and traditional training.  Still, if you so choose, the Agency is more than willing to compensate agents who acquire different skills.&quot;

&quot;Is this going to be dangerous?&quot;

&quot;//Everything// is dangerous,&quot; the Envoy replies with a grin.

//That doesn&#39;t sound encouraging….//

&quot;[[Alright, I will give you a brief overview….]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="683" name="Alright, I will give you a brief overview…." tags="" position="6639,19363" size="100,100">&quot;I will start with the least dangerous mission.  We have a wealthy client that requires a covert investigation… and you are well suited to such observations.&quot;

&quot;Who is the client?&quot;

&quot;They remain anonymous until you accept the contract.  The client is a well known popstar.&quot;

&quot;And what am I supposed to //investigate?//&quot;

&quot;There have been accusations of embezzlement...and //murder//.&quot;

&quot;And fucking //murder//!?  That is the least dangerous option?  Are you fucking kidding me?&quot;

&quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t joke about such things!  Murder is just a possibility.  Yet, with so many &quot;suspicious suicides&quot; murder is always a possibility.&quot;

&quot;Wow…&quot;  //Why the fuck did I agree to this!?//

&quot;It is a very simple mission: solve the case.  Easy.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound fucking easy!  At all.&quot;

&quot;[[These probationary missions are meant to be difficult.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="684" name="These probationary missions are meant to be difficult." tags="" position="6494,19446" size="100,100">&quot;Mission number two involves a corporate infiltration.  We have received a generous proposal: if we acquire certain technological data and transfer it to a given account… well let&#39;s just say many parties will benefit of which the Agency and yourself will of course be included.  I don&#39;t personally think a little corporate espionage is a big deal, but some of the megacorps are //quite// sensitive when it comes to their secrets.  All you have to do is acquire some special data, an easy task… if you can get access to their computer core.&quot;

&quot;At least that doesn&#39;t sound too bad.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!  Even though the last two agents we sent disappeared - [[I am supremely confident in your success, Taylor.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="685" name="I am supremely confident in your success, Taylor." tags="" position="6636,19505" size="100,100">&quot;Wait.  What?&quot;

The Envoy ignores you.  &quot;The third mission is a bodyguard job.  A world-famous actress has had death threats and several determined stalkers breaking into her property.  The poor woman fears for her safety...&quot;

//World famous actress…?//  &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about being a guard…&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to…  There will be trained guards on site.  Given your skills, um, you will be more of a body-double than an actual bodyguard.&quot;

&quot;Wait a second!  You want me to //impersonate the actress!?//&quot;

&quot;Of course, body-doubles only work if they are convincing.  With your transformative skills...well I doubt there will be any doubles more convincing than you.&quot;

&quot;Fuck that.&quot;  //There is no way in hell I am dressing up like some Hollywood starlet!//

&quot;And the fourth mission?&quot; you ask, feeling like your strange new friend probably [[saved the most dangerous for last.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="686" name="saved the most dangerous for last." tags="" position="6491,19604" size="100,100">Your fears are confirmed a moment later.  &quot;Yes, the fourth objective...involves the removal of a high priority target.&quot;

&quot;A //removal?!//&quot;

&quot;Yes, an assassination,&quot; the Envoy clarifies.

&quot;What the fuck!?  I am not killing anyone!&quot;

&quot;What about for sixteen million dollars?&quot;

&quot;Whoa...S-sixteen?  That is a lot of money... a fucking shitload of money... but I am not a killer.&quot;

&quot;Well there are ways around that specific detail.  Are you really killing anyone if the poison does the work for you?  Or if you lead a target to a kill zone or trap?&quot;

You feel the questions are meant to be rhetorical but you answer anyway, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s still murder... I think.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes murder is justified,&quot; the Envoy counters.

&quot;Yeah...I guess….&quot;

&quot;The target has earned his death and his expiration will make you and the Agency rich -- and the world into a much better place.&quot;

&quot;Even so...&quot;  This just sounds like a path that leads to you rotting in a jail cell.

//Fuck me...//  You suddenly feel weighed down.  These are not the sort of decisions you were expecting to make when you woke up this morning.

&quot;Choose, Mr. Roux.  Time is of the essence.&quot;  The Envoy checks his watch as you make your decision.

“Ughh…”  //That’s so fucking stupid… and kind of sweet…//

“What are you doing?” Drew asks as you push him down onto the couch.  As Drew sinks to the cushions, he groans as you awkwardly position two pillows on either side of Drew’s head so that he can lie down without putting pressure on his neck.   

You begin to gently massage Drew’s shoulders.  From the moment you touch him, it is clear Drew is tense.  His flesh seems to radiate heat.  You begin to slowly work your fingers into Drew’s neck muscles.  “Ohh….mmm….Taylor...”  You hear Drew mumble into the cushions.

“Did you enjoy your burger?”

“Yes...I ate it while you were in the bathroom,” Drew admits.

“You feel so tense…”

“That’s because you are...//touching me...//”

“Do you want me to stop?”

“No!”

“Well what’s your problem?”

“You already know…  You just make me so nervous.  You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and you are giving me a massage!” Drew exclaims, as if he is just as shocked as you are that circumstances have evolved to [[reach this bizzare point in time.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="693" name="reach this bizzare point in time." tags="" position="12091,18495" size="100,100">His words twist your stomach into knots.  //Why does he have to say stuff like that?//  “Oh that’s nice… Um…I am not a real girl though...but you know what Drew?”

“What?”

“I am willing to pretend for you.”

Drew groans in pain as he rolls onto his back.  “Taylor…”  Drew looks absolutely panicked.  His eyes are wild.  Above all Drew looks //frightened.//  //Of me...//

“Drew, it is okay.  I think all you need is a bit of experience.  You will see most things in life are only a big deal if you obsess over them.”

“Maybe...but even if I didn’t freeze up around women….even if I did somehow get a girlfriend by some miracle...well I know she would never be as perfect as you are, Taylor.”

Drew’s words make you happy...and they also make you cringe.  You suddenly feel guilty.  //I don’t even deserve a friend like Drew...//

“Hey Drew, you ever got to second base before?” 

“I have never touched a real woman,” Drew sorrowfully admits.

“Well my body is all woman…”  //My mind, not so much.//  You sigh.  “Drew, you can touch me if you want.  I am...okay with it,” you pry the words from your lips.  “It is just the two of us here.”

Your offer makes Drew begin to vibrate with nervousness.  [[You look at Drew’s boner and bite your lip.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="694" name="You look at Drew’s boner and bite your lip." tags="" position="11945,18553" size="100,100">//Oh my god...//  It never ceases to disturb you that you now evoke such a reaction from men...and from your friends too.

//Fuck...Drew is rock hard and I am wearing a sexy nurse outfit!//  You push up your new enhanced cleavage into view and smile at your best friend.

“I--I--Uh...I--Uh--I can’t help it!” Drew stammers.  “You’re just too...too...too b-beautiful!  P-please, Taylor!  Let me touch you.”

You swallow nervously before answering.  It seems some of Drew’s anxiety is contagious.  “Anything you need to help nurse you back to health!” you respond with a too-dry mouth.  You feel yourself falling into a mental role.  //I am nurse...A caregiver.  A sexy nurse offering care!//

You briefly wonder if you have gone completely nuts as you bend over and [[display your backside for Drew.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="695" name="display your backside for Drew." tags="" position="12097,18647" size="100,100">You nearly squeak in surprise as Drew’s hand suddenly squeezes your ass.

“Wow… so soft...oh my…”  Drew trails off in apparent amazement.

You grit your teeth as you let your best friend fondle your ass.

“This is….//amazing!!!//  You are the greatest, Taylor.  Your...ass is the greatest.”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taynurse.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Drew’s compliment makes you nearly burn up with embarrassment. //I can’t believe I am letting fucking Drew Drachmann feel me up….this is so wrong on a thousand different levels.//  Yet not only are you letting it happen - you also encouraged it!

Just as you are about to protest, Drew boldly places his hand between your legs and gently runs a thumb over your panty covered slit.

“It is so //warm,//” Drew observes with fascination as he gently pulls your panties aside.  “You’re soaked,” Drew says with wonder as he runs a finger across your sex.  You cringe and pull away from his touch.  When you turn around, you find Drew staring at you, looking you right in the eyes.  “Taylor...you really like this too?  [[You are aroused...just like me…”]]  Drew seems to have come to a realization, for a strange determination now glows in his eyes.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="696" name="You are aroused...just like me…”" tags="" position="11941,18705" size="100,100">You flush with embarrassment but find his accusation impossible to deny.

“I want to feel your boobs,” Drew requests.  His bluntness surprises you.

“Uh...yeah I was pretty curious too.  Go ahead.”

Drew suddenly freezes.  You pull down your nurse top and display your bra-covered breasts to your friend.  You look down at the massive protrusions and find your hands drawn to them.  

“Taylor, I want to...but I don&#39;t know if I can. Should we really be doing ths?  What about our friendship?”

&quot;It is because of our friendship I am doing this,&quot; you answer.  //All this insanity already hard enough on me as is...//  You decide to take the initiative.  You grab Drew’s hand and place it on your boob.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taynurse2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Drew’s resolve immediately crumbles.  “Oh wow...This is what a woman’s chest feels like.  It is better than I imagined...I feel like I am in heaven.  I have spent so much of life staring at these things on screen...but to feel them in person is something else entirely!”

“Yep, boobs are fucking awesome!” you agree.  You just wish it wasn’t your chest that was being groped.  You have always wanted to fondle a beautiful woman as Drew is now...//Fuck, at least I get to live vicariously through Drew.//

[[Drew’s breathing becomes ragged.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="697" name="Drew’s breathing becomes ragged." tags="" position="12093,18799" size="100,100">Your bold actions seem to inspire the same in Drew.

“Taylor...I have always wanted to see a vagina.  I kind of gave up on girls...I don’t want to a virgin forever but I have accepted my fate.  But...maybe if I could just see one...up close, in the flesh...well that might make me feel a little better.”

A voice inside your mind screams at you to stop but you silence it and fall deeper into your role.  “Making people feel better is what Nurse Taylor is all about!”


 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taynurse3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


“Hmm…”  //This is definitely a bad idea...//  But you are clearly way past that point now.  It is for Drew!

With butterflies swirling in your stomach, you slide off your panties for Drew and bend over so that he can see your bare, dripping pussy.

Drew inhales sharply, his breath a hiss.  “Wow...oh my god…  This is so cool….  A pussy...a real pussy...in front of me...A dripping pussy…. //Taylor’s pussy...//”

“Ugh…” you groan in embarrassment at Drew’s descriptions of the state of your arousal.

You draw away again and when you turn around you see Drew with a face pinched up with pain.  The next thing you notice is [[that Drew is pitching a massive tent in his pants.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="698" name="You suddenly feel hopelessly drunk and confused." tags="" position="12093,18943" size="100,100">Your eyes focus on Drew’s erection.  You can feel his member pulsing in your hand.  You cannot believe how hard Drew’s dick is. Having experience with your own, it is clear Drew is at peak arousal.  //He got like this because of me!//  That is a fact that is both arousing and shameful at the same time.

There only seems to be one thing to do now.  //I am going to suck Drew’s cock….my best friend’s cock… I don’t want to do this… I just want Drew to feel better… and there is nothing I can do...except this.//  You feel incredibly mixed up, but through it all comes only one piece of clarity: arousal. 

You begin to jerk Drew off, taking the tip of his penis in your mouth.  You look up at Drew and kiss his glans, revelling in the salty flavor as you do your best to pleasure him.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taynurse5.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

Eventually your movements become smoother.  You fade into a steady rhythm.  You cup Drew’s balls with your left hand and jerk him with your right while your tongue and lips work his head.  Drew’s shaft is soon coated in your saliva.

You look up at Drew and it is clear he is having the time of his life.  His joyous expression tamps down your disgust and [[encourages greater effort on your part.]]

All you want is for Drew to finish.  You want him to cum hard, to find relief in your actions.  You suddenly take Drew’s shaft deep into the warmth of your mouth, your tongue licking the underside of Drew’s member.

“Taylor...I can’t...ohh…. I am going to---uhh….oh god….thank you for this moment…”

Your mouth floods with salty precum.  [[You are pretty sure you can guess what comes next.]]

You have already committed… You know you are too far gone to stop now.  You open your mouth and stick out your tongue, content to let Drew’s cum land where it may.

“Ohhhh….” Drew moans in ecstasy as he jerks off all over you.  His seed splatters all over your face, some even landing on your tongue.  The now somewhat familiar fishy taste assaults your senses and you suppress the urge to gag.  //I don&#39;t want to ruin this for Drew...//

You look at Drew, his face contorted with satisfaction.  Drew’s bliss makes you feel like your humiliation was worth it.  As your best friend’s cum drips down your face and pools on your tongue, you are suddenly reminded of one of Drew’s fetishes.

You have already tasted Drew’s cum...on several occasions.  You decide to give Drew one final bonus.  You squeeze the remainder of Drew&#39;s cum onto your tongue.  In a moment of absolute madness, you go even further, swallowing Drew’s load like a hard liquour shot before moving on to kiss drew’s cockhead and semen stained fingers.

“Taaylooorr…” Drew watches you in a state of disbelief.  “That was the best time of my life…” Drew whispers as collapses onto the couch and passes out a second later.

You walk to the bathroom with the taste of Drew’s cum on your tongue, wondering just how your longtime friendship has transformed so much in such a short time that [[you hardly recognise yourself anymore.]]

You briefly check on Drew and decide to head home.  You leave Drew sleeping where you left him with a look of contentment on his face.

You walk home while maintaining your new busty figure.  You notice a distinct extra jiggle with each stride.  Your enlarged breasts and extra cushioned butt bounce a little too much for your comfort.  //These boobs look good but are pretty damned uncomfortable!// you complain as you straighten your back.  

When you arrive at your house you notice a box on your doorstep.  //A really heavy fucking box,// you note as you pick it up and carry it into your living room.

“Oh shit… these are the books I ordered!” you guess as you feel the heavy objects shift inside.

//Fuck yes!  Maybe the answer to all my problems is just a few pages away.  I can do this!//

Despite the flashy covers, the books are fairly complicated.  You do your best to push forward but soon become certain you are missing out.  //I just have to focus!// you tell yourself.

Three hours later, you sigh and slump over the books, defeated.  

//Well...shit...//  There is only one obvious course of action you can think of.

Julie and I are free spirits….Your cousin, she&#39;s a great gal...but the truth is I wish I would have met //you// first.”

Ryan’s words cause you to momentarily forget to breathe.

“Julie and I merely do what feels right in the moment,” Ryan continues.  “That&#39;s why I am going to kiss you now and you and I are going up stairs to have mind blowing sex before your cousin gets home from work.&quot;

//It may be true Julie is a bit of a &quot;free spirit,&quot; AKA slut but I seriously doubt she would forgive me for stealing her fucking boyfriend behind her back...//  

Ryan&#39;s smiling, handsome face looks on eagerly as he waits for you to respond.

But you find you just can&#39;t do anything except give in to your heart.  You feel like someone in freefall.  The world is suddenly hurtling around you except for the one place of calmness in the storm where Ryan stands.  A part of you is more than curious, another quite horny, while still another aspect of yourself screams on that fucking your sister&#39;s boyfriend would probably make //you// a bigger slut than your sister.  //Fuck me...// you think but the thought soon takes on a double meaning.  You are suddenly reminded of the growing, discomforting wetness and heat that has begun to emanate from between your legs.

//This is bad...so bad it is almost good…. It is like multiplying two negatives, right?// you think as you finally decide to:
[[Go upstairs with Ryan]]
[[Push him the fuck away!]]x</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="705" name="Go upstairs with Ryan" tags="" position="12593,18500" size="100,100">You squirm in discomfort for a moment, finally deciding that the yearning inside you is now far too great to bear.

You look up at Ryan and find you can&#39;t resist his steady gaze and twinkling blue eyes.  You can&#39;t help but smile back; Ryan’s broad grin is just too contagious.  Ryan grabs your hand and then gently leads you upstairs.  You follow like a good little girl.

//Oh my god….//  Even though you are heading into your own room, you somehow feel like you are walking into a lion’s den.

With a chuckle, Ryan spins you into the center of your room and then closes your door.  He then begins to take off his jacket as you watch on, finding you can&#39;t tear your eyes away from his masculine frame.

Ryan notices you watching him and swaggers forward, slowly undoing the buttons of his dress shirt, revealing a chiseled stomach that makes you envious and warm at the same time.

You clench your teeth as you watch Ryan strip.  You always thought men were ugly...but Ryan…  //Holy fuck there is nothing “ugly” about him...//  You shake your head but find yourself still flustered and strangely dizzy.

“Is it hot in here?” you wonder.

Ryan laughs.  “Just us, babe.”

//Okay...this is going to be so fucking weird but... I still want to do it...Fuck...I want to have sex with Ryan.  Everything is worth trying at least once, right?//  A month earlier, such an impossible notion would have never occurred to you.  Yet here you are.  A man in a woman&#39;s body, alone in a bedroom with your sister&#39;s boyfriend now standing shirtless before you, and you have already decided you will let Ryan do whatever he wants with you.

[[Tonight you are going to lose your virginity with a man you had always admired.]]

“Taylor…” Ryan //growls// as he embraces you, his voice full of longing.  Ryan kisses you again and the intensity catches you off guard.  He kisses you so passionately he almost seems...//hungry.//

You feel like you are being devoured.  “Um...Ryan…”

“Don’t worry, I will lead.  I will be gentle,” Ryan assures you.  He then begins pulling your shirt upwards.  You raise your arms and allow him to pull it over your head.  “Wow...you are gorgeous, Taylor... absolutely fucking gorgeous,” Ryan mutters as he stares at your chest.

With expert skill, he unclips your bra faster than you could have yourself.  Your bare breasts fall free before Ryan and he wastes no time before beginning to cover them with kisses.

“Oh!”  Ryan’s hands rise to cup and fondle your breasts.  With swirling fingers and delicate circular motions, Ryan makes your breasts ache.  Your nipples are instantly rock hard and you feel yourself heating up all over your body until you fear that you may just burst into flames.

You let a moan escape from your full lips but it is short lived for Ryan suddenly kisses you and steals your breath away.  Your heart literally skips a beat and then several more.  You finally manage to suck in a quick breath.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss3.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Ryan proceeds to make out with you, ravishing your lips and chest, while his masterful hands work [[you into an absolute frenzy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="708" name="you into an absolute frenzy." tags="" position="12593,18656" size="100,100">You feel a switch flip in your mind as you orgasm, a euphoric shiver permeates throughout your body, dueling with your body’s burning heat and desire. 

“Ohh~!” 

//Ohhhhhhh………….fuckkkk………....//  You have lost control of yourself and any semblance of protest or resistence dies as you gaze into Ryan’s penetrating blue eyes.  You have long ago crossed //the line,//so how could you not see this event through to its logical conclusion.  //Sex.  Between a man and a woman…  Oh god… and I am the woman.  I am a woman!//  Given how great you feel at this moment, you are beginning to think that isn’t entirely a bad thing. 

You become conscious of your thundering heart and pull yourself away from Ryan long enough to catch your breath.

As you do so, Ryan uses the opportunity to grab something out of a small bag.  He produces a small bottle of massage oil.  

“What are you going to do with that?” you ask Ryan, but answer the question yourself as the words leave your pouty lips.  You feel your loins heat up even more as you vividly recall the events of the night you last received a massage.

“Foreplay,” Ryan answers with a leering grin.

You would gladly take him up on his offer but you quickly decide that you want more.  You cannot wait any longer… and by the look of Ryan’s enthusiastic member, he was eager to proceed as well.  

You lick your lips and try and will some moisture into your mouth.  //Fuck, I am going to be so dehydrated after this!//  Your eyes return to Ryan’s penis.  As weird as it makes you feel, your dominant reaction is one of arousal.

[[You finally muster enough saliva… and courage to respond.]]

&quot;Just a vague suggestion to call and your phone number.&quot;

&quot;I see.  That sounds very unusual.  That isn&#39;t how we normally send out advertisements.  Does the note say anything else?  On the back maybe?&quot;

You flip the note over and, sure enough, you notice a tiny sentence printed in microdot size font hidden at the very bottom of the page.   

&quot;Uh...it says...Brush wire toupee...mango dancer at midnight?&quot;  //What the fuck did I just read?!//

The woman on the other end of the line is silent for a long moment.  &quot;I see.  What did you say your name was?&quot; she finally asks.

You hesitate before answering but it is pretty obvious whatever weird organizations are targeting you already know your name if they already have your address.

&quot;Huh?  What are you talking about?&quot;  //Was that even ...a sentence?//

&quot;Please repeat the message, Taylor Roux.&quot;

&quot;Taylor Roux, thank you for calling!  Have a nice day!&quot; Sally chimes as she hangs up on you.

&quot;What the hell just happened….?&quot; you wonder.  You check your phone&#39;s clock.  It is already noon and Elixir park is a fair hike away.  You will have to hustle if you want to make it in time for this weird metting.  Still, is it really a good to get involved in something that might be way over your head?  You already feel like a small fish in a big pond.  Yet maybe if you go to such a meeting there is a chance you will get some answers.

“It is okay Drew...I will take care of your discomfort.”  //What the fuck did I just say?//

You fall to your knees before Drew.  You fall into a naughty, determined trance, eager to accomplish the mission in front of you.  You are going to make Drew feel good.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taynurse4.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You feel a bit sexy and hopelessly perverted as you slide Drew’s fly down.  With a single slender finger you push aside Drew’s underwear.  His cock then flops out, bringing with it a manly musk.  The butterflies in your stomach intensify their acrobatics.  [[You suddenly feel hopelessly drunk and confused.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="713" name="You finally muster enough saliva… and courage to respond." tags="" position="12449,18702" size="100,100">“Uh...Ryan….as nice as that sounds...I think I am wet enough I don’t need that…” you confess.  Your admission sparks a twinkle of sapphire in Ryan’s eyes.  It also prompts Ryan to check the truth of your words. He gently repositions his hand over your fiercy tingling mound.  Ryan slowly, erotically rubs his index finger down your cleft, running delicate circles around your soft, slick flesh.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryantaylor.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; height=&quot;960px&quot;&gt;
“Wow...you weren’t lying,” Ryan observes as he plays with your clit.

“I am pretty blunt,” [[you note and Ryan chuckles.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="714" name="you note and Ryan chuckles." tags="" position="12589,18800" size="100,100">“Taylor, you are //soaked.//”  Ryan withdraws his hand and draws apart two fingers, revealing a pair of glistening strands.

You are enormously embarrassed but you have never been one to dwell on such feelings.  //Better to embrace it than wallow in it...//  

You snort...girlishly.  “And you appear…”  You wrap your tiny hand around Ryan’s shaft and give it a few soft pumps.  “...to be in a similar predicament,” you finish.  You take the ball of your middle finger and scoop up some precum from Ryan’s opening.  You giggle as you give Ryan the middle finger.   “You’re //soaked// Ryan!” you mock him as his fluid drips down your finger.

For an instant Ryan looks shocked but soon his expression morphs into one of pleasure and amusement.  //Uh oh...//  You have a feeling you may have just ignited the start of a sexy competition.

“Okay.  So we are both ready then…”

“Um…”

“What’s wrong, Taylor?”

“Why are you teasing me like this!?  I thought you said you were going to lead,” you playfully protest.

“You are just so fucking cute...I need….//want// to enjoy this as much as possible,” Ryan readily answers.

“I can’t wait anymore!” you shout.  “We don’t have all fucking day and, as curious as I am about all this, I don’t want to be stabbed to death with a kitchen knife by Julie if she walks in on us.” Ryan’s eyes go wide but he soon shrugs and returns to his usual self-assured default.  The reminder of the potential danger is both arousing...and frightening.

“Heh...noted....but...  Taylor, let’s not think about Julie.  This night is all about //us.//”

“That’s….”  //Silly.  Sweet.  Stupid.  Romantic.//  You can’t quite narrow down the right word to describe it.  Your line of thought is silenced when [[Ryan kisses you and pushes you down onto the bed.]]

//To go where no man has gone before!//

“Taylor, can you please //encourage// me?” Ryan requests as he crawls onto the bed beside you.  

You almost laugh but stop yourself short.  Ryan doesn’t seem like the type to need encouragement.  But, here and now, he desires your approval and willingness.  Delirious, with pleasure, you indulge him.  “Please Ryan I need you!” you call out to him in your sexiest voice. 
“My first time is yours.  Go ahead, fuck me and make a real woman out of me,” you purr as you open your legs and spread your tight, bare virgin pussy before the man you once desired to be the most.  Now you want that same man //inside// you.

“Wow.  With fucking pleasure, my dear!” Ryan responds.  He grins at you while repositioning himself and gently spreading your legs apart.  Ryan then begins to oblige your request, sliding his huge, [[swollen member between your legs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="716" name="swollen member between your legs." tags="" position="12593,18948" size="100,100">“Ah!  W-wait…” you murmur and Ryan stops moving.

Ryan’s cock is just too big and the whole scenario just seems so...//off//.  //There is no way that thing is going to fit inside of me...//

“Let’s just take it slow…” Ryan suggests.  He then lifts you up with two well muscled arms and sets you on top of him.  Your vagina is now pressed against Ryan’s penis.  //This is taking it slow!?//

&quot;Ohhh...&quot; you moan.  In this precarious position you feel yourself becoming unbearably aroused.  You slowly begin to grind back and forth, basking in the pleasurable warmth of your genital contact.

Soon you are both slick and hot.  “Oh my…This feels so good...”  You let out a squeak as you tense up and a small orgasm washes over you.  You feel your center flood with love juice… fluid that now coats Ryan’s manhood and eases his motions against you.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wetgrind.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

“Just wait until it is inside….”

//Yes… God help me...I want to know what it feels like.//  “Uh… okay Ryan I am ready...let’s try again.”  Using one of your hands, you [[guide Ryan’s manhood inside of you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="717" name="and exit the office without another word." tags="" position="8635,10001" size="100,100">//What a fucking weirdo...//  You sigh and begin the long walk home with a nagging headache.  Even the fresh air does little to blunt its intensity.

When you arrive at home, you notice an extra pair of men’s shoes at the entrance.  You hear giggling from upstairs.  //Fucking Julie!//  You suppress the urge to cringe and scowl, dashing upstairs to your room where you soon seal yourself away for the night.

The next morning you wake up feeling sore.  “Ow…” You probe the side of your head and are alarmed to feel a //very// tender spot.

“What the hell?”  The pain reminds you of a time years earlier when you were struck by an errant baseball.  That //really// fucking hurt yet this time you don’t even recall taking a hit.  

You shower and dress in simple fair, a stolen blue and white striped T shirt and Julie’s jeans.

Soon you are walking to class, lost in the bizarre combination of sounds where the city met the campus’ green areas and green core.  You listen to honking car horns and construction while chickadees fill in the background.  Countless machines and birds duel for supremacy of the cacophony but you find the noises to be a pleasant distraction.  For a while you only think about birds and assholes with no catalytic converters.

You remember that Deter had been excited about today’s lecture.  You become absolutely certain your morning is going to suck.  //And then I am off on a damned mission…  How in the fuck am I going to steel this corporate creep’s phone?//  You aren’t exactly known for your dexterity outside of video games.

“Hey Evan, Drew!” [[You call out to your friends as you show up for class.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="718" name="You call out to your friends as you show up for class." tags="" position="8779,10099" size="100,100">“Hey Taylor!” Evan greets you, his face lights up as you approach.  “Still looking… uh, good….”

“Uh...Yeah, fuck off.  I got some leads though…”  You decide not to share all of Deter’s secrets until you learn more.

“Oh, that’s good.”

“Hi Taylor!” Drew nervously greets you as he rushes to join you and Evan.

“Drew,” you nod.

“So what did you find out?” Evan inquires.

“Nothing really… only that Mr. Deter is a super fucking creep.”

Evan laughs.  “I could have told you the same thing with minimal research,” Evan jokingly boasts.

A large group of students walk passed you and into the classroom, triggering most of the others in the atrium to follow like a grand human herd.

You give into the instinct as well, entering class early for a change.

You note Mr. Deter is also present unusually early.  He flashes you a too-eager smile as you enter.

Drew seems to notice your unease.  He begins to excitedly talk about a new medieval simulation game that is soon to be released.  [[The fifteen minutes before class begins passes by in a flash.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="719" name="The fifteen minutes before class begins passes by in a flash." tags="" position="8635,10153" size="100,100">It takes about three minutes of Deter’s droning before you are nearly sound asleep.  Just as predicted, Deter’s lecture sucks.  A lot.  You find his monotone voice to be suicidally boring.

Eventually, Mr. Deter’s loud lecture intrudes on and pollutes your dreams.  You force yourself back into wakefulness.

“Just as Pavlov’s dogs can be conditioned to react to stimuli, it is my opinion that this same approach can be used to influence humans on very deep levels,” Mr. Deter hypothesizes.  One of the students sitting near the front of the class raises a hand.  “Yes?  You.”

“So...what would be a practical example of this?” the student asks.

“//Sexuality!//” Deter emphatically answers.  Mr. D then then takes a deep breath, puffing out his barrel chest.  “The internet is making men gay!” Mr. Deter shouts his controversial declaration.

You look up from doodle of a trebuchet shooting a distant burning castle and listen with interest.

The whole class has gone completely silent.  You bet you could hear a pin drop.  “Wait.  What?”

Mr. Deter scowls in irritation that his students did not reach an identical conclusion.  “Just as Pavlov conditioned his dogs to associate the bell with food...humans now layer all sorts of compulsory stimuli and signals upon each other.  For example, men who masturbate to pornographic images - especially those that have such addictions-” Mr. D takes a moment to eye several males in the crowd before continuing,  “--may associate the sight of an erect penis as a precursor stimuli to their own sexual gratification.  Over time, if this continues, it is easy to see how a man who once perhaps only fantasized about only women in a purely heterosexual fantasy, can easily transition into something quite homo-erotic after observing predominately heterosexual intercourse.  A straight man who gets aroused at the sight of another man’s penis is probably not an entirely straight man and it doesn’t take very long to acquire the impulse of arousal.  If such stimulation goes on long for enough it might become difficult for such a person to become aroused without the presence of both genitals….a logical continuation would be the gradual removal of female models and the increase of male - “transforming” [[sexuality in the process!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="720" name="sexuality in the process!”" tags="" position="8775,10247" size="100,100">“That seems...highly unlikely!” objects the same student who asked the original question.

“Is it?  You all have seen it.  //There are penises all over the internet!//  There is clearly some sinister force at play whereby they are attempting to normalize us to the sight of unnecessary phalluses!” Deter sagely hypothesizes.

“Huh?  Who… is?”

Mr. Deter sighs as if he was speaking to a particularly dim child.  “Many organisms //learn.//  If a rabbit in the campus park sees a thousand people walk by it and pay it no attention it learns - rightfully or not - to not fear the presence of people.  This anonymous group on the internet appears to be focused on making everyone think a flapping penis is like a damned wave or something!  This is disgusting!  This is the height of moral degeneracy!”

The student sits down, clearly too stunned or intimidated to ask a further question.  Amazingly, another brave student raises their hand.  “Yes?  You!”

“Who do you think is behind this “homosexual conspiracy”?”

Mr. Deter smiles and nods thoughtfully.  “Excellent question!  Bonus points for you.”  Mr. Deter waddles over to his podium.  “This conspiracy is most likely perpetuated by Russians,” he speculates.  “Or Jews.   Or perhaps //Jewish Russians.//”  You watch with amazement as most of your classmates continue to take notes.  //Wow...have we all become normalized to Deter’s madness?  I can’t believe I paid money for this class...//  “Of course, the Chinese are a possibility as well,” Deter guesses.  “Many Eastern nations seek to sow the seeds of discord in Western countries, so that we stagnate and decline as they advance and pull ahead.”

The second student appears fascinated.  “[[So you think political correctness is a Chinese psy-op?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="721" name="So you think political correctness is a Chinese psy-op?" tags="" position="8635,10297" size="100,100">“Or Russian.  Or //Jewish// Russian,” Deter adds.  “It could also be a number of groups working in tandem.  Their plan is quite brilliant actually: by convincing just a small portion of the student body decades ago to become ignorant communists these people have now grown up and fill all corners of government...and academia-including this very university!  They hate and ignore science - and so - //I hate and ignore them!//”

//Wow!//  The weirdest part of Deter’s semi-random rant was that you agreed with a lot of it.  Recently your student body has hosted multiple rallies //against// freedom of speech.  At first, you were fairly certain it was a joke but over a thousand students showed up to protest the very values that had made their society free and prosperous.  Even weirder still, is that you recall seeing dozens of hammer and sickle flags at the demonstrations… //And Mr. D disapproves, despite his famous moustache?  What the hell is happening to the world?// you wonder as the bell rings softly, blessedly cutting Deter’s madness short.  All the students begin to slowly pack up.

“Taylor!  Want to come out for lunch?” Evan offers.  “A couple of us are going…”

“Sorry Evan… I have ….plans…”

Your awkward phrasing makes Evan’s face contort into a grimace.  “Like a date?”

“No!” //Fuck...I hope not.//  “I just got a few things to do, some leads, you know?  Research!”

“Do you want some help?”

“No, I will take care of this on my own.  Thanks though.  Don’t worry about me!  Cya later guys!”  [[You depart with a wave at Drew.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="722" name="You depart with a wave at Drew." tags="" position="8771,10395" size="100,100">You step out of the science building and wander towards the west side of campus, in the direction of Candy Lane.

“Hmm, that is weird and pretty fucking creepy!  I don’t remember giving Deter my number.  Oh well...”

As you pass an open field, you notice that there is another ongoing student protest of some sort.  There are only about twenty people or so, but their signage and multi-coloured hair makes them stand out.

You internally debate taking a different route but decide a detour would take too much time.  [[You walk right by the protest.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="723" name="You walk right by the protest." tags="" position="8637,10441" size="100,100">A shabby dressed but bright eyed woman with dreadlocks dashes over to you.  “Hey sister!

“Yes!  The most important fight in history!”

You raise an eyebrow.  “...World War II?”

The woman laughs.  “Way more important than that shit!  This is a battle for our freedom!  For the future of all womynkind!”

“Uh, I am sort of busy right now…”  //And I am not your “sister.&quot;  I am not even a damned woman!//

“That’s fine, sis.  This is just a rehearsal.  The main protest will be on Friday.  Please come if you can.  We need all the support we can get to fight back against the patriachy!”

“Sure thing…” you answer.  The history illiterate chick seems mollified and you leave her, walking by while awkwardly eyeing the protesters and their ample signage.

“MORE WOMEN - LESS TOXIC MASCULINITY - BETTER WORLD!” [[reads the largest sign floating over the protest.]]  //Women good.  Men bad.  Gotcha...//

The bunny is waving a sign reading, “GENDER IS MENTAL NOT PHYSICAL!  THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GENDERS - DON’T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST US!”

Your eyes scan the crowd.  You consider yourself far from shallow, but you cannot help but note there isn’t a single looker in the entire crowd.  //Hmm...//

You notice a spikey haired young woman who looks like she just came back from a punk show is holding a small poster filled with handwritten scrawl explaining her thoughts on the matters at hand:  “Women Rule In the Absence of Patriarchy.  Down with men!  Up with Womynkind!  WOMYN DEMAND EQUALITY!”

//Patriarchy?  Equality?  What are they even protesting?// you silently wonder. You are nearly certain this university’s board and administration are nearly all women and the student body broke 75% female last semester.  “Equality” would seem to dictate they should reverse their efforts.  You are beginning to think the feminists won’t stop their crusade until they control everything and have firmly placed their foot down upon the necks of their male “former oppressors.”  

//I don’t really want to be oppressed by any fucking nutjobs!  I don’t give a fuck if they are men or women.  I may be in a woman’s body but thank fuck I still have my mind.//  You briefly imagine joining one of the seemingly nonsensical feminist groups and standing topless to protest women being objectified.  You snicker at the thought.

A piercing ringing noise interrupts your thoughts as a broad shouldered woman with close orange cropped hair takes her position at the front of the crowd, [[megaphone in hand.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="725" name="megaphone in hand." tags="" position="8637,10593" size="100,100">“We have gathered here today to fight for //justice!//” the woman’s shrill voice echoes throughout the campus.  “We are here to stand against those who would silence our voices.  Just as the //heroes// of past generations fought for equal rights, we are here today to do the exact same thing!”

//Hmm...I am pretty sure women and weirdos already have rights...// you think as you edge a bit closer to the crowd out of morbid curiousity.

“We call upon the university to protect our right to not be offended by banning the rampant hate speech on campus!  Free speech shouldn’t--and doesn’t protect //nazis!//”

//What the hell is a “right not to be offended”?// you wonder.  //Geez… maybe Mr.D is on to something...//

The crowd of mostly portly and multi-coloured misfits cheers in response to their leader’s words, prompting the woman to continue, “If Peter Jordanson wants to spread his lies about there only being two biological sexes then we must rally and stop him.  It is //hateful!//  We must defeat and halt such hate from spreading by shutting the mouths of those who would propagate it!  And we should slap them a few times while we are at it so they will never speak again!” she adds.

“Yeaaahhh!  All groups we don’t agree with should be banned!” [[cheers the man in the pink bunny suit.]]  &quot;Fuckin&#39; nazis!&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="726" name="cheers the man in the pink bunny suit." tags="" position="8781,10695" size="100,100">“For freedom of speech!  Woooo!” shouts a voice from the crowd.

“Fuck the fascists!” yells another.

“Alright, the other Gender Studies class is out so the rest of our members should be here soon.  Let’s PROTEST!  Everyone got your ANTIFA certified balaclava?  Suit up!  Let’s destroy some small business owner’s windows and really stick it to the fascist oppressors!  //C’mon, heroes, let’s save the world!//”  The lingering echoes of the megaphone permeate through the field while a hammer and sickle banner is unfurled behind the speaker by a scraggly guy wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt.

You wonder how it is even possible these students are able to live with so much cognitive dissonance.  //I am really glad I skipped those weird elective classes...//

“Oh yeah~  One more thing,” the broad shouldered woman picks up megaphone again.  “There is a patreon link on our facebook page - so please remember to donate so we can accomplish more great activism and [[keep this campus safe of people who disagree with us!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="727" name="keep this campus safe of people who disagree with us!”" tags="" position="8637,10753" size="100,100">“I disagree with you!” shouts a distinctly male voice from somewhere behind the crowd.  //Uh oh.// A man wearing a dirty apron approaches the gathering.  By his dress, you guess that he is one of the cooks working at the campus concessions.  “I think you are wrong and that all of this censorship puts us on a very slippery slope that, once this extends to its logical conc--”

“SHUTUP! SHUTUPSHUTUP!” the woman with the megaphone yells over the newcomer.  “YOU ARE JUST A FUCKING STRAIGHT WHITE MALE AND NO ONE GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK!”

“But I am speaking the truth!  How do you even know if I am strai--”

“SHUTUP! SHUTUPSHUTUP!  You do not get a right to speak!  Your hate speech isn’t tolerated here.  This campus is a safe space!  Your kind has had their time in control!  It is time for a new world ruled by the once oppressed!  We are not going to take your shit anymore, cis boy!”

“Cis…?  I don’t know what that means.”

“What an insensitive man.  That is //so// offensive.”  

The poor, brave man is then drowned in a hail of boos and curses.  One of the protesters dumps a slushie on the newcomer’s head and [[he gets pushed away from the crowd.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="728" name="he gets pushed away from the crowd." tags="" position="8781,10842" size="100,100">“Owwww….  Please just let me speak!”  The cook tries in vain to reason with the crowd but they drown out any attempts in a derisive wail.

“Fuck off or we will bash you, //fascist!//” shouts the pink bunny.

“Fascist!?  What the?  I am not a---I just believe in freedom of spe---AHH!!  Ow!”

“BASH THE FASC!  BASH THE FASC!” the mob chants as they advance on the lone man.

The protesters suddenly surge forth and attack, pummelling the poor fellow to the ground.  You are pretty sure you see an eraser bounce off the guy’s noggin too, just as the pink bunny punches him square in the balls. 

You watch with amazement as the man is driven off, dripping and limping.  //Fuckin’ wow...that guy practically got lynched.//  [[You feel bad that you didn’t even consider helping the guy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="729" name="You feel bad that you didn’t even consider helping the guy." tags="" position="8637,10896" size="100,100">//I don’t want to be late… or get lynched.  And I definitely don’t want to get involved with any more crazies than necessary.//  The crowd begins to dissolve and you exit with the flow.

“Oh we should like totally loot that one store on 99th that has those gorgeous purses- that would like totally show our corporate overlords who is boss,” you hear a tiny asian woman with a “death or liberty” sign suggest to her friend as the mob marches on by you.

“I could not believe that guy in the apron,” complains another.

“Nah.  Typical man,” disagrees the butch feminist.  “That outspoken douche is so self centered and privileged he thinks he can just take over our rally and make it about white supremacy?  Not on our watch!”

“Heck yes!  Someone has to stand up against the KKK.  I can’t wait to tell my grandchildren about our struggle one day.”

“Oh-em-gee!  That is why we need to take a lot of pictures!  We will just photoshop out the undesirables like french-fry man!” gushes one of the other student protestors.

It seems pretty obvious that getting mad at an innocent male fry cook for having a penis and “oppressing” women over the folks with money and actual power that cemented these “oppressive patriarchal” structures in place is counter productive.  Wealth and status seemed to be more important distinctions in regards to personal beliefs than a person’s mere genitalia. You also note it is a tad odd that most of your normal friends don’t give a shit about a person’s race and judge most people on their merits and character, yet these “anti-racist” and “anti-sexist” crusaders are the most racist and sexist people you have ever met in your entire life.  For most regular folk these issues were not of high importance, yet for the social justice warriors, it is the //only// [[thing that seemed to matter to them.]]

//Fuck...maybe it has.//

“Hmm….  These people seem to have some strange idols.”  As a kid, you always looked up to Arnold Schwarzkopfanator.  That guy got chicks merely by flexing his muscles.  Why anyone would idolize and romanticisze a bunch of communists is beyond you.  //I wonder why I never see Mao T-shirts… is he just not photogenic enough?//  Marx seemed like a douche in your estimation and his ideas invariably ended in mass death and totalitarianism.  You mentally count the number of subtle incidents where you learned about Karl Marx and get a shockingly high number.  Old Karl pops up in nearly every class no matter how unrelated his presence may have been.  //Maybe Mr. Deter is right…. Could there really be some kind of weird commie-homo agenda…?  Is such a thing even fucking possible?//  “Hmm… I thought the Russians hated gays...hmm… wait... Oh my god...are they using //them// against us!?”  You suppress a shiver.  “I wonder why these protesters leave Mr. Deter alone...  It must be that intimidating moustache that reminds them of one of their mutual idols,” you answer your own question.  “Fuck.  What the hell am I even doing!?  I can’t think about this shit right now...or hopefully ever!  I have to keep my mind clear and focused!  I have to turn back into a fucking man and rejoin the patriarchy before it is too late!  Now how the hell do I do that?”

You follow the chanting of the mob and resume your journey to Candy Lane.  It takes you over half an hour to get to the distant luxury restaurant strip on foot but you arrive [[early enough to look for Mr. Ferret.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="731" name="early enough to look for Mr. Ferret." tags="" position="8631,11038" size="100,100">You walk down Candy Lane with your eyes scanning the restaurant balconies and outside tables.  Every couple of minutes you glance down at your phone and Lucas’ photograph to keep a constant fresh image in your mind.

As you stroll down the strip, you recall what Deter said to you the day before.  //Apparently Lucas is interested in cute brunettes...//

“But why the fuck does it have to be //me?//” you quietly ask yourself under your breath.  You don’t really have a problem using your appearance as an advantage but you realize that line of thought now represents a very slippery slope with a dangerous ravine at the bottom.

You check a half dozen restaurants and bars but don’t see anyone matching Lucas’ description.

A muscled man resembling a gorilla approaches you.  “Hey babe!  What are you doing out here all alone?  Interested in getting a drink with me tonight?” 

You raise an eyebrow, almost forgetting how you must appear to him. 

“No.  Fuck off, please,” you answer and stomp off.

//What a fucking creep.//  Up ahead, you spot a flashy sign.  //Da Vinci Dining.  That sounds promising.//

[[You start walking towards the restaurant.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="732" name="You start walking towards the restaurant." tags="" position="8671,11201" size="200,200">You are about to walk through the front door of the restaurant when you notice an outside seating area off to the side, shielded by large sheets of glass and sheltered by several large umbrellas.

You spot a man in a well tailored suit sitting alone at a table.  Your eyes meet as the man sips his drink.  You instantly recognize your target.  Your heart skips a beat as you awkwardly look away.

//That’s him!//  You mentally cheer.  You have found Lucas Ferret.  //Finding him is the easy part...//

You look back in Lucas’ direction and are both horrified and delighted that he is still looking directly at you.  You have clearly captured his attention.

//Now what the fuck am I going to do?// you ask yourself as you mull over your options.  Standing nearby Mr. Ferret, you notice a tall man you had first assumed was a waiter, but his lack of movement and wary stance eventually makes you identify the man as a bodyguard of some kind.  //Shit.  This might be really hard… or really easy,// you predict as you look down at your still-unfamiliar chest.  //If I use these puppies I bet I could get more than that old dude’s phone.//  Still, the idea of using your appearance to take advantage of a man is super weird.

“Hmm… maybe I should…”
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;

[[Try and find another way]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="733" name="Try a direct approach" tags="" position="8583,11455" size="100,100">You decide to take a direct approach.

You steel your emotions and stride forward, doing your best facsimile of a sashay.  Lucas watches you approach with a smirk.

“Hello!” you greet Lucas.

Lucas’ eyes slither up and down your body and his smirk morphs into a pleasant smile.  “Hello there.  Care to join me for lunch?” he offers without further ceremony or inquiry.

“Uh…”  His sudden offer shocks you.  “I’d… //love to//,” you answer.  //Real smooth, Taylor...//

“You don’t sound particularly enthused,” Mr. Ferret notes with a degree of impatience.

//Fuck, I am losing him.  I can’t screw this up!//  “Oh, sorry… you are just so handsome that you made me a little bit nervous,” you explain.  Your answer pleases the executive greatly.  “I am Taylor,” you add.

“Ah, an absolute pleasure to meet you Taylor.  You are a very striking creature.  Please sit if you have a moment and we will have something to drink.”

On the outside, Lucas appears to be a confident man, completely comfortable in his own skin.  His immaculate suit, fluid gestures, and ready smile attempt to put you at ease.  Except it doesn’t //quite// work.  You can’t put your finger on it, but there is something about Lucas that makes your skin crawl.

You quickly accept his invitation.  “Thank you, Lucas.  [[That is very generous.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="734" name="Let him come to you" tags="" position="8874,11457" size="100,100">You decide that being aggressive will only arouse suspicion and put you into an awkward situation. //I don’t want this creep to get the wrong impression. He might use that as an excuse to push my boundaries. I have to let him come to me…//

“I’d like a table,” you say to the host, a slender young man in his mid teens.

The host smiles at you warmly. “What’s the name your reservation is under?” he asks you.

“Uh… Sorry, I don’t have one of those. I don’t really need much time. I am just a single! Surely you can squeeze me in!” you insist.

The host blinks. “You’re s-single?” He appraises you with wide eyes. You notice the boys cheeks have taken on a crimson cast. 

//Oh… I think this kid finds me attractive. I guess I can’t really blame him...// Encouraged by the boy’s reaction, you lean forward a bit and give the young man your brightest smile. “Yeah! A table for one,” you tease him. “Easy in and out! Surely an important young man like yourself can help me out. Please, I am sooo hungry!”

The host’s face reddens even further. “Easy in and out,” he repeats. The boy’s blush intensifies. He shakes his head but his reaction doesn’t seem to be one of refusal. [[He flips through his reservation list and glances out at the restaurant floor.]]

Just like that, in an instant of pain and discomfort, Ryan is through.  Your hymen splits apart as your introitus accepts Ryan&#39;s penis.  You are now having sex with Ryan Creston, your one time hero and manly idol.  It is a completely surreal moment.  Immensely fucked up, wrong, right, and //awesome// all at the same time.

“H-holy fuck…”

You slide down until Ryan penetrates you completely, pushing forward until the entirety of his girthy shaft is embedded inside you.  You look down at your stomach in disbelief.  //It went in… Ryan’s dick is really inside me…  I am impaled on Julie’s boyfriend...//  The immense pressure and strange feeling of a foreign object deep inside your pussy frightens you.  You rub a hand over your buzzing clit, but when you withdraw them, your eyes are drawn the unmistakable redness of blood.  The thought of moving makes you scared.  Yet, after about a minute or two of holding Ryan inside you, you begin to feel more accustomed to his size.  You were never one to be dominated by your fears.  You slowly begin to rise and fall, establishing a slow steady rhythm as you fuck Ryan while your mind marvels at how bizarre the entire scenario is.  

“Taylor… You’re so...damn...tight...ugh…” Ryan groans as his huge cock plunges in and out of you.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cowgirlcockride2.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Your virginity in the rearview mirror, you focusing on enjoying the moment and trying to etch every bit of the experience into your memory.  //When I change back into a man I won’t ever be able to do any of this kind of stuff again, so [[I might as well enjoy it while I can, right?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="737" name="I might as well enjoy it while I can, right?" tags="" position="12597,19096" size="100,100">Ryan’s massive penis spreads you apart, //rips// you apart, as it invades your love canal.  Being penetrated for the first time hurts but you are already so wet and eager that the pain is just a candle compared to your bonfire of desire. //No pain, no gain!//

You begin to bounce up and down on Ryan’s cock, cowgirl style.  Each insertion brings little more pleasure and a little bit less painful discomfort.

You find the pace and intensity of your own movements is increasing to match Ryan’s lust.  You and Ryan momentarily lock eyes and your thundering heart beats even faster.  The way Ryan looks at you, with absolute yearning and deference, makes you just want to give in to all of the accumulated urges and feelings that have built up inside of you.

You feel yourself slipping away.  //Holy fucking shit.  I am having sex.  With Ryan.  As a god-damned woman.  Fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK!// Your mind rebels as Ryan makes love to you.  Ryan fondles you and teases your lips.  Soon Ryan’s tender caresses and steady, pounding cock manage to push you over the edge into [[a sea of pleasurable oblivion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="738" name="a sea of pleasurable oblivion." tags="" position="12453,19146" size="100,100">“Ughhnnn...mmm...ohh….fuck…” you whimper as you tighten and shiver despite the heat, cumming hard on Ryan’s thrusting penis.  The intensity of your orgasm shocks you.  Every inch of your body is now covered with sweat, while your pussy floods with fresh, feminine juices.  After a few deep breaths, you wipe the tears from your eyes.  //Wow… //  Is the only thought you can muster.

Ryan grins at your shuddering body and leans down to kiss you while remaining embedded inside you.  “Don’t worry, Taylor.  Just the first of many-- of that I can assure you.”

//The first of many?  Is that even...possible?//  You fear you will end up with brain damage if you have too many orgasms like you just experienced.  How could your body recover from such intensity?  More disturbing yet, is that you have never been more turned on in your life.  The first time you had masturbated as a little boy hooked you as a daily subscriber for life… but experiencing an orgasm as a woman during intercourse was on another level entirely.  //Oh….I think I could used to this..  An apple and an orgasm a day keep the doctor away!//  You stare at Ryan’s broad, muscular chest, looking down at his penis thrusting in and out of //you.//  This shouldn’t be happening but it is...and it feels good...//really// good, so why stop?  You have already gone so far down this path that there is nothing left to do except let loose and enjoy yourself.  Which you promptly do.  Your pain forgotten, you begin to enthusiastically ride Ryan.  You had long ago decided not to do any hard drugs, the pleasure seemed too addicting.  //But maybe this is worse!   This feels so fucking good it almost has to be too good to be true.//

Now you have this handsome, powerful man under your spell.  You literally have got him by his balls, and it feels //fucking great!//

“I am going to make you cum,” [[Ryan hoarsely whispers.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="739" name="Ryan hoarsely whispers." tags="" position="12592,19252" size="100,100">“//I// am going to make //you// cum,” you counter as you adjust yourself into a more comfortable position, eager to get Ryan back inside you.  Ryan has shared so much pleasure with you and taught you so many things that you desire to return the favor.  With a look at Ryan’s sweaty, smiling face you easy back down onto his shaft.  You begin to hump and grind against Ryan.  A few seconds later, you are riding his cock like a madwoman, trying to get Ryan as deep and as many times inside you as possible. 

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/intense.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Hehehe…”  You feel like you have completely lost your mind.  You have never felt so //alive.//  Ryan pounds you while you repeatedly throw yourself back down on his dick in time with his powerful thrusts.

You cannot gauge how much time has passed.  You become lost in the unusual sensations, gradually coaxing you closer and closer to a dramatic climax.

The room smells like sex.  [[The sounds of your love making echo throughout your room]].

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorrouxmale.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You are in your early twenties.  You are slight of build but in decent shape.  You have brown hair and eyes and stand about five feet, ten inches tall. You have what you consider to be an average size penis. Aside from your lopsided grin and infamous potty mouth, there isn&#39;t much about you that really stands out.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $ftaylor is true&gt;&gt; You are Taylor Roux... sort of.  While still you on the inside, your body has undeniably changed...becoming completely female.  Although you have maintained your trim figure and some facial features, everything else has changed.  You bear a striking resemblance to your sister, Julie.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taygirl.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You have shoulder length brown hair and big brown eyes.  Between your legs is an unfamiliar fleshy void.  Sticking out from your chest are two very distracting, perky B-cup breasts.  You now seem even closer to the ground.  Even standing straight up, you doubt you are much more than five feet tall.

You have transformed...again.  //Into a little girl!//  You are //tiny// and have noticeably shrank to well under five feet tall.  Your hands, arms, and legs seem frighteningly delicate and fragile.  You have barely noticable A-cup breasts and a very slender figure.  Your skin has lightened in color and become pale while your hair has faded to a lustrous blonde.  You look like a young schoolgirl.  The only thing that seems to have stayed consistent are your eyes… a fact that really creeps you out.

You have a feeling that no one will take you seriously in this form or allow you to buy liquor without ID.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $uglyb is true&gt;&gt; You have altered your appearance to avoid suspicion.  You have changed your hair pigment to blonde as well as given yourself relatively unflattering features.  You might draw a few stares but no one will be looking at //you.//

You have taken the appearance of Randy Riley, a famous nymphomaniac pornstar. You have long brown hair and bright green eyes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/riley.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You are about five feet and three inches tall. Your A cup breasts and perfect round ass are modest in size, giving you a youthful appearance. All things considered, you are a mega babe.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $bjcho is true&gt;&gt;You have taken the form of BJ Cho, a famous Korean dancer. There is striking contrast between your glossy black hair and incredibly pale milk-white skin.

On your chest, you have large, prominent breasts. Your very wide hips produce a somewhat awkward and inadvertently sexy gait. With a tight stomach filling in your slender midsection, and an easy going smile, it is clear you don&#39;t need any dance moves to get the attention of every man in sight. Your new form possesses a perfect hourglass figure. Many suspect your proportions and flawless skin are the product of surgery.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/chodance.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

You are tiny. At 5 feet even and about a hundred pounds, you feel almost weightless, skipping and hopping inadvertently with almost every step.

At 32-24-32 you have a balanced girlish body. While you hardly notice your A cup breasts, your long reddish-brown hair is another matter entirely, serving to distract and annoy you at every opportunity.

“I have //uplifted// you and made you something greater than the sum of your human parts.”

“What are you talking about?”

“I will share some information with you and explain your new gifts, but only if your prove your are willing to work with me.”

“What the hell man?  How am supposed to do--” your voice cuts off as Mr.Deter begins to strip down.  The older man takes his shirt off, revealing a broad, hairy chest and large belly.  As he starts to work his belt lose you //NOPE// out of there as fast as you can.

You make it to the door just as Mr.D calls out to you, “If you leave now I guarantee you will be stuck like that forever.  It is a simple choice, if you want to be a girl forever, by all means //leave// but if you have any modicum of respect for your former, superior gender I would advise you to come back here, strip, and then lie down on my couch.  You are going to suck my dick,” he informs you as if pointing out the weather outside the window.  It was just a statement of fact: simply something he clearly just expects you to do without complaint.
Still, he is your only source of information and might be our only hope  to change back back to the way you were before.

With a strange buzzing sound in your ears, you finally decide to:
[[Get Mr.D’s info]]
[[NOPE! GTFO!]]

Your pubic and vaginal muscles clamp down on Ryan’s manhood as you orgasm and grind madly against him.  A rush of delirious warmth washes over you.  You feel your vaginal canal flood with love juice just as Ryan begins to moan.

“Me too!  I am cumming inside you, Taylor!” Ryan announces.

//Kacha.  Kacha.  Bang.//  You suddenly freeze and tense up as you hear a noise at the front door along with the jingle of keys.

“Fuck!  Julie is home!  Get off me….Ohh….” you protest as Ryan surges in and out of your sopping wet sex.  To your dismayed delight, Ryan accelerates the pace of his humping.  “Nooo!  We have...to uh.. stop!”

//Fap.  Fap.  Fapfapfapfapfap!//

“Ugh...Uh!  UHHHHhhhhhhhhh….ohhhhhhhhh……….” you moan as Ryan’s haggard breathing intensifies.  //This is bad!  Fuck!!!!//  Maybe it is fitting that the most pleasurable moment of your life should immediately proceed your inevitable murder.  “[[We have to stop!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="744" name="We have to stop!" tags="" position="12593,19405" size="100,100">Ryan now has a wild look in his eyes.  “I can’t!  Ohhh I uUUUHHH!!”  You look on in shock as  your lover does the opposite of what you expect.  Instead of getting off of you, Ryan thrusts his cock balls deep and ejaculates deep inside you.  Ryan’s huge cock pulses inside you until his testicles are drained and your pussy is full of your former idol’s semen.  It feels indescribably weird but pleasant...or it would if you didn’t have Julie Stormcloud banging on the door downstairs.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminpuss2.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The warmth and odd sensation of Ryan’s cum spreading inside you is suddenly forgotten by a feeling of panic.  //Julie!//  You have never been so glad that Julie carries a huge wad of keys with her, for “self defense.”  She probably hasn’t used her door key in ages, buying you precious seconds to pry yourself away from [[Ryan’s sweaty, muscular body.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="745" name="Ryan’s sweaty, muscular body." tags="" position="12449,19443" size="100,100">//What the fuck have I done!?//

You manage to pull your pants up and stagger downstairs, throwing yourself down on the couch and placing a nearby pillow over your crotch just as Julie enters the living room from the front door looking somewhat annoyed.

“Hey Taylor!  What the hell is going on?  Why was the door locked?  Is Ryan here?  What are you two doing?” Julie throws out a series of questions.

“Uh….”  Your mind stalls as you try and think of an appropriate answer.  You feel embarrassed and ashamed.  //I didn’t mean to be so slutty...fuck...yes I did...//  The admission wounds you.  You feel like a piece of shit and don’t want to dig yourself any deeper by lying on top of your omissions and infidelity.  You feel like you have let yourself and your sister down.  Yet the night you had traded your integrity for was truly amazing…[[except for this current part]].  “I…”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="746" name="except for this current part" tags="" position="12593,19549" size="100,100">“Hey Julie!” Ryan interrupts, swaggering into the room.  “Taylor and I were just playing a game while I was waiting for you.  Welcome home!” Ryan greets Julie.  You internally burn with jealousy when Ryan places a kiss on your sister’s cheek.

Julie smiles at her boyfriend, instantly forgetting her questions.  “Hey Ryan~!  You’re all sweaty!”

“I just finished a jog,” Ryan smoothly lies.  The ease at which he answers shocks you.  //Has he ever lied to me?//

“Gotta keep that hot bod in shape.  It has been a long day...I really need you tonight.  I hope you’re horny, because I know I am!” Julie purrs to Ryan.  //Gross… I wish I didn’t hear that.//  Your eyes meet Ryan’s for just a moment and he shoots you a sad smile.  Julie then leads Ryan upstairs while you awkwardly watch and listen to your sister giggle and converse with Ryan.  You catch the tail end of a lewd joke.

“God damnit…”

The rest of the night is absolutely awful.  Your conscience nags at you until you until you angrily crush the sentiments.  //It isn’t my fault.  Or at least not completely.  This body has done things to me!//  And now Ryan’s body had as well.  //Ugh… will I ever be the same?//  You now have serious doubts about… everything.  [[Your life is a mess.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="747" name="Your life is a mess." tags="" position="12449,19591" size="100,100">You listen to your sister getting fucked senseless by Ryan while you silently wish you could swap places with her.

As you listen to the sound of their sex, you rub at your swollen pussy, still full of Ryan’s seed.  It was proof of your affection, of your intimate moment spent together.  Yet even that sticky consolation provided only minor comfort.  You soon find that your fingers are unable to pleasure yourself in the same way you know only Ryan could.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminpuss3.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

//Oh my god...what if I get pregnant with Ryan’s child?//  The thought strikes you like a lightning bolt.  Your blood runs cold.  //Would that even be such a bad thing?//  The enormity of your last thought takes a moment to sink in.  You bury your head in your hands.  Ever since your transformation, you had always held the belief that even though your body may have changed, your personality and //soul,// the core of who you were as a person would never change.  You are now fully aware of just how much you have transformed in just a short time.

You inspect your delicate, tiny hands.  “I have spent too long in this body...experienced too many thrills…”  You not only look like a girl - //you are starting to think like one too//.  //FUCK!  Everything is so god damned confusing.//  Around Ryan you are aware you act differently.  You seek his approval and affection.  You want it more than anything else.

“Fuck me…”

You’re still Taylor Roux, just a different version of yourself.  You fear your mind will soon come to completely match your new body.

Although Tim has always been a gregarious person, you don’t know him very well.  You doubt getting friendly with him now as a drunk female is a good idea.  You shift position and try and get comfortable but suddenly find yourself wide awake, subtly spinning from your long night’s after effects.

“Wow, you’re super fucking hot!” Tim comments, admiring your appearance in the dull light.

“Thanks I guess…” you absently reply.  Eventually you look over at Tim and he meets your gaze with a ready smile.   You wish he wouldn’t look at you with such interest.  His almost unblinking stare causes you to feel uneasy.

“So, how come I have never seen you before?” he asks you.

“Oh...that is a really long story.”

“You and Evan are friends?”

“Yeah, we go way back.”

“I didn’t think he had many female friends.”

“He doesn’t.”  //Well, maybe plus one since my transformation...fuck.//

Tim seems to notice how uncomfortable the question makes you.  He changes the topic.  “Did you do anything [[crazy for summer vacation]]?”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="750" name="crazy for summer vacation" tags="" position="13591,16952" size="100,100">“Just a few parties and game nights,” you vaguely answer.

“Oh, you like games?”

“Who doesn’t?”

“Uh, most chicks… well the games they like tend to suck.”

You talk for a while, making seemingly nonsensical drunk chatter.  The conversation is a pleasant distraction.  You soon find yourself laughing at Tim’s stories.

“...So the showers and washrooms were in a central location outside of our sleeping area...and then just I get back to the hotel room, they lock the fucking door on me!”

“No way!  Those assholes.  So you’re just...like naked in the hallway!?”  You can’t help but get a little caught up in Tim’s ludicrous story.

“No, not completely!  I had a face cloth.”

“Huh?  A //face cloth//?  Hahahaha!”

“I know, right?  And not to brag, but I am fairly well endowed.  I need more than a little thing to cover up!  And then those assholes passed out right after locking me out.  I was banging on the door but I didn’t want to draw too much attention to myself.  So I found a spot next to a potted plant and hunkered down for the night….  Got woken up by security two hours later!  They drag me outside in front of my friend’s room - who are reacting just like you - killing themselves with laughter…  Just brutal!  They have my arms behind my back while I am desperately trying to shield my dick with this tiny piece of fabric…”

You wipe tears of laughter from your eyes.  “That is hilarious.  Did you end up in jail?  Are you like a sex offender now?”

“No, of course not.  My buddies came out and stopped everything...after I was in the cruiser.  I hope they hosed down the seats after I left because I am pretty sure I shit myself,” Tim confesses much to your delight.

“Hahahaha…. Too funny.”  [[You wipe a tear from your eye and giggle as your mirth gradually subsides]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="751" name="You wipe a tear from your eye and giggle as your mirth gradually subsides" tags="" position="13751,17002" size="100,100">“How you feeling, Taylor?”

“I feel… pretty good!” you admit.  “Despite how much I drank tonight… tomorrow might be rough.”  You still feel a pleasurable buzz, your worries firmly pushed into the background.  “What about you, Tim?”

“I am a bit horny,” he admits.  “It was hard being around all these hot babes tonight, not a single one seemed interested in my charming personality...or my huge cock.”

You look over at him, roll your eyes, and laugh.

“It’s true.  I need way more than a face cloth to cover Little Tim, see what I mean?” Tim says as he boldly pulls back his sheet, [[revealing the biggest dick you have ever seen in your life.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="752" name="revealing the biggest dick you have ever seen in your life." tags="" position="13595,17102" size="100,100">“Whoa!  That’s-fucking-huge!” you cry out in drunk surprise.  The massive, veiny, black monster between Tim’s legs is probably four or five of your old cocks merged into one.  “Wow…” is all you manage to say.  You are stunned at his size.  Normally you would be grossed out, but the sudden appearance and your blood-alcohol level dulls and morphs your reaction into something you had not quite expected. Your sex is irrelevant, Tim’s huge dick is just too impressive.  You can’t //quite// seem to draw your eyes away from it.

“You wanna try it out?” Tim offers with a broad, white-toothed grin.

“Haha!  And die of internal bleeding?  No way!”

“Hey, don’t knock it till you try it.”

The seconds tick awkwardly by and you flush as you watch on as Tim’s member rises to life.  The display almost reminds you of watching a snake charmer.  Although now you are charming a snake of a different sort.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tim2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

//Why the fuck can’t I look away!?// you mentally scream at yourself.  You don’t want to look at a fucking dick...yet maybe, a part of you actually does since you are unable to peel your eyes off Tim’s phallus.

“Well, what you do you think?” Tim asks you while brandishing his cock.  He slowly jerks it off, running a large hand up and down his shaft.  //Fuck...why am I watching this guy jerk off?//  

“Uh...that is kind of…”  You take a deep breath and answer with the first thought that comes into your mind.

[[impressive]]
[[gross]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="753" name="impressive" tags="" position="13752,17206" size="100,100">“Uh...that is pretty…impressive,” you finally manage to respond.  You cringe at your word choice.  //Did I just admit I like his dick…?  Fuck I have really gone off the deep end lately.  Maybe I am drunker than I thought?//

Tim’s eyes light up with your words.  “Do you want a closer view?” he asks you.  Tim doesn’t wait for a response, casually standing up and walking over to you, his massive, fully erect cock bouncing around with each stride.  Tim takes a seat beside you on the loveseat.

Being so close to that //thing// makes you feel very uncomfortable.

“I hear it might taste a bit like chocolate.”

“I highly doubt that…”  A part of you wants to scream and run away but you again find yourself staring at Tim’s dick.  It is just //so// fucking big. You didn&#39;t even know it was possible for a penis to get so large.  //This isn&#39;t photo-shop...this is real life... fuck!// The slightly purple head and the thick, veiny shaft that is thicker than your forearm frightens you and arouses you at the same time.  //Am I breathing heavier?  Fuck… I don’t want to get turned on….//  Yet such mental protests do nothing to slow the gathering heat and wetness that is now dripping out of you and soaking your panties.

“It isn’t going to bite,” Tim jokes.  He suddenly snakes a well muscled arm and hand between your legs.  “Wow, you are soaked.  [[You clearly love huge black cock, right?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="754" name="gross" tags="" position="13450,17150" size="100,100">&quot;...really fucking gross.  Put that shit away you creep!&quot;

Tim seems to approve of your silence.  He suddenly puts a huge hand on top of your head and forces you down to his crotch.  The close up view and smell assaults your senses.  //Whoa!  He is way bigger than Mitch…  Oh god am I really going to do this again?  Voluntarily?  Why the hell am I even thinking about this?//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timpresuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With a close up view of Tim’s immense size, you can’t help but open your mouth in shock.  “Oh yeah babe!” Tim misunderstands your reaction and takes your motion as assent, pushing his big black dick forward towards your waiting lips.

“Wait!  Uggllarghh...” your protest dies as you nearly choke on [[Tim’s pungent musk.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="756" name="Tim’s pungent musk." tags="" position="13748,17350" size="100,100">//What?  No!  I don’t want to suck any dicks!  Why does this keep happening to me?  And why the hell do I feel so //weird// when I look at this guy’s dick?  I have to stop him right now before it is too late!//  “Tim---” you start but have your words cut off by the entry of Tim’s big black cock.  Two seconds later, Tim has a third of his massive girth inside your mouth.  Your tongue and Tim’s manhood touch and you are rewarded with a salty, sweaty taste.  Tim thrusts in about half his length and you gag and choke as it hits the back of your throat and momentarily blocks your airflow.  //Yeah… I would definitely die if I had sex with this guy.  Fuck, even having him in my mouth might choke me to death!//  You feel so conflicted.  You don’t want to die choking on another man’s penis.  //I am a fucking man.  This isn’t supposed to be happening!//

Yet such mental protestations do nothing to alter the reality of your circumstances.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timdeepthroat.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You now have Tim’s cock in your mouth.  You struggle to accept his length but manage to take more than half of him down your throat.  Then, when you believe you are at your limit, Tim thrusts forward another inch.  //Holy fuck… [[I am deepthroating a cock]]...//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="757" name="I am deepthroating a cock" tags="" position="13604,17468" size="100,100">“Holy shit girl…  That is //so// fuckin’ hot.  I can’t believe you can almost take the whole thing in.  Not the first dick you’ve sucked is it?”

You shoot Tim an angry look.  But with his cock in your mouth, it doesn’t quite have the intended effect. If anything, Tim’s cock swells even further and, for a moment, he cuts of your air completely.  You are suddenly glad for your practice with the bananas and for the fact you are not sucking Mitch.  //But Tim is way bigger than a banana… and even if Tim is a million percent better than Mitch… he is still a dude.... and so am I... Fuck!!!//  

“Gah...uhhhoh ahh!” you cough when Tim withdraws, allowing you a chance to breathe.

&quot;This feels so good!&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytimdeep.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Tim begins to eagerly fuck your face and you let him.   A submissive switch seems to flip within your mind.  //A product of my time with Mitch?  Fuck, I have become accustomed to being fucked by strong men?//  Regardless of how it happened with your bully, you eventually gave in to the pursuit of pleasure along with your female desires.  Having sex as a woman felt good… even with Mitch.  You cannot help but wonder what it might feel like to have sex with someone else.  It has been far too long since you have had a mostly guilt free orgasm. There is an ache deep inside you, a dull yearning.  You&#39;re hungry and horny and you want something to fill that void.  [[You want Tim’s big black cock inside you]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="758" name="You want Tim’s big black cock inside you" tags="" position="13752,17502" size="100,100">You let Tim use your mouth as an orifice for pleasure.  Tim places his hand at the back of your head and begins to assert control over your actions.  You aren’t even giving him a blowjob really, there is no tongue or lip work, just Tim forcing his cock in and out of your mouth.  His dick repeatedly strikes the back of your throat. Sometimes it is even worse, thrusting on further down your wet mouth hole.  Soon you feel completely dazed.  Tim seems more than content to ravish your mouth with his hot cock.

“I am cumming!” Tim suddenly announces.  //Nooo!  Don’t cum inside me!// transforms to //Don&#39;t cum on me!// as Tim withdraws from your mouth, your saliva coating his meaty erection.  You experience an awful and awesome moment as you watch Tim tower over you, his monument of manhood at peak arousal.  Tim begins to groan and forces you to your knees.

Tim then proceeds to jerk off the biggest load you have ever seen onto your face.  After a dozen drizzling spurts, you are covered with Tim’s semen.  You can feel its sticky wetness drip and coat your face and hair - you suddenly realize you probably look like you were just participating in a bukakke video.  //But it was only one guy… one really big guy...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timfacial.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You are overwhelmed by the sudden fishy smell.  //Holy fuck…  I cant believe how quickly that just happened.//

“That was fucking awesome.  You’re such a sexy little girl,” [[Tim compliments you between ragged breaths]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="759" name="Tim compliments you between ragged breaths" tags="" position="13596,17612" size="100,100">You run your tongue in a circular motion around your lips, tasting Tim’s bitter, fishy seed.  It only serves to reinforce that Tim has experienced a great orgasm while you are still unsatisfied.  You wipe Tim’s cum off your face, and not seeing any alternative, you wipe it on Evan’s couch.  //Serves him right for not buying Kleenex.//

Your hand probes your genitals and confirms what you had suspected.  Heat radiates outward from your groin.  “Damn…”  //My shorts are soaked… god damn this body!  And Tim’s...really big cock…. fuck!//

Your inhibitions are gone, burned away by arousal and alcohol.  //I am just too hot… I am going to burn up unless I do something to quell these feelings--quickly!//  You begin to stroke yourself in front of Tim.  Soon you are full on masturbating, rubbing your soaked, red-hot slit while playing with your clit.

Tim watches you work with wide eyes and a face-splitting grin.

“So… you are going to take me up on my offer, right?” Tim questions you.

You bite your lip and nod, lying back on the futon and spreading your legs and pussy for your new friend.

Tim joins you a second later, his huge erection rejuvenated.

Your eyes focus on Tim’s dick.  //Fuck….//  Tim makes Mitch’s huge cock appear like a child’s in comparison.  You don’t even want to think where [[your former penis would fit on that spectrum]].  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="760" name="your former penis would fit on that spectrum" tags="" position="13756,17654" size="100,100">Tim takes position between your legs, placing his glans at your entrance.  It’s firm presence makes you flood with love juices in anticipation.  //Ugh… I will need all the natural lube I can get for this...//  “It is okay, right?” Tim prompts as he applies pressure and sinks slightly into your sopping pussy.

//This is such a bad fucking idea!// your mind rebels.  Yet being aware something is a bad idea has hardly been something that has stopped you lately.  You are becoming a bit of a submissive hedonist… and perhaps a bit too much like Julie.  You sigh.  You just want to feel good and forget about all the consequences and bullshit that often go along with it.

“Tim, please fuck me,” you request.

“Fuck yes!” Tim cheers as he thrusts forward, pushing his huge black cock between your wet, warm folds.   Although Mitch had fucked you thoroughly, taking on Tim’s huge size feels like you are losing your virginity again.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timfuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
To the amazement of both of you, your pussy swallows Tim’s entire cock.

“Hnnnngggghhh….”  You stare in shock at your stomach and lower body, visualizing and feeling Tim inside you.  You can clearly feel him pressing against your cervix.  It is more than uncomfortable.  It fucking //hurts.//  The pain is only magnified as Tim begins to slowly move in and out of you.  “Oww….  ouch!”

Tim is clearly having a much different reaction.  “Holy shit girl… you are just made for sex.  You are fucking perfect!  Your pussy is fucking great…. So warm...and ungh… wet… and fucking tight...”  Tim then withdraws to his glans and penetrates you completely.  In the motion, he leans forward, planting a sloppy kiss on your lips.

“Mffpmmph!”  You resist the kiss and scowl.  When you turn your head away Tim takes the hint.  [[He then redoubles his pussy pounding efforts.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="761" name="He then redoubles his pussy pounding efforts." tags="" position="13600,17764" size="100,100">You and Tim fuck for a long time.  It takes ages, but you gradually get used to his size and receive more pleasure with each additional thrust.

Finally, you feel yourself approaching orgasm.

“I am getting close.  Let me get on top.  I want to ride you,” you inform Tim of your desires.  He grins and repositions on the futon, lying down on his back with his erection pointed to the ceiling.  You crawl across the creaky futon mattress and mount Tim.  You guide Tim’s shiny, slick black cock inside, feeling yourself get filled to capacity.  The new angle of penetration feels ...awesome.

With your new position on top, you feel in control.  You feel finally free to seek your own pleasure.  You decide to use Tim like he earlier used you.  //You’re just a big dildo, Tim!// you think as you begin to rise and fall on his shaft.  Soon you are bouncing and riding, grinding enthusiastically in a quest for a great orgasm of your own.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/timdrunknight.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A few minutes of moaning, squelching, and creaking later, you finally approach a fuzzy wall of beckoning white light.

You hump your way towards it until you break through it, like a marathon runner crossing the finish line.  You cum so fucking hard your head lolls and your body goes limp.

Tim is pushed over his limit as well, he grabs your hips and butt and slams you hard against his cock, you can feel his massive dick ejeculate inside you and coat your insides with another huge load.

“Wow… you are... so sexy…” Tim mumbles as he passes out.

You flop back on the bed exhausted and content.  You fall asleep a few minutes later with [[Tim’s cum leaking out of you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="762" name="Tim’s cum leaking out of you." tags="" position="13756,17794" size="100,100">You wake up with a sore, crusty pussy and a migraine. Your eyes fall on Tim’s sleeping figure.

A disconnected flashback of sex images scroll through your mind. “Ughh… I did it with another guy.” And this time it was done willingly. //Or mostly willingly...//

You scramble to get dressed until Tim’s voice interrupts you. “Mornin’ babe!”

“Morning…”

“Going already? I was kind of hoping we could grab breakfast together. I am pretty hungry after last night.”

“Uhh… I think I need a shower more than food.”

“You can use ours if you want,” Tim offers.

“No, that’s alright… I’m just going to head home, shower, and then probably pass out again.”

Tim sighs, clearly disappointed in your answer. “Can I get your number at least? I had a lot of fun last night!”

//I am sure you did...// “Um…” 

[[“Sure…”]]
[[“That’s probably not a great idea. Sorry!”]]

“Hmm…  Well these look promising.  Whoa, look at the laser on the cover of this one!  It looks like that orbital cannon I used to obliterate your--”

You frown at the reminder of your defeat.  “Drew, please focus,” you interrupt your friend.  

“Well… this is going to take a while,” Drew predicts as he lays out several of the hefty books.  You are suddenly glad that Drew has to read that shit instead of you.  You scoot forward and squint at the page Drew is reading.  It almost appears to be written in some kind of alien language.  //It looks like I owe Drew yet again.  Oh well, I would rather suck his dick than read those boring tomes!  Uhh… Wait, what the hell did I just think?//  You shake your head and resist the urge to slap yourself.  You are getting far too used to this body and the expectations that come with it.  //I have to change back before it is too late!//

You leave Drew to his research, grabbing what you think is the easiest text for yourself.  You head into Drew’s living room and plop down on the couch and [[open the book on the coffee table.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="764" name="open the book on the coffee table." tags="" position="12096,19399" size="100,100">It quickly becomes apparent that you will need to google a bunch of things or pick up some sort of reference text or primer to make sense of what you are now reading.

You pull out your phone and start searching definitions.  You stumble onto a weird website and are soon entangled by a series of unrelated subjects.  You don’t mean to procrastinate but you end up doing so all the same.  Still, you gain a bit of general knowledge about the latest scientific advancements in miniaturization and nanotechnology.

//I really hope Drew is having better luck than I am.//  

After a couple of hours, you decide to check up on Drew.  You creep back to the kitchen and watch Drew’s hunched figure pore over the remaining text books.  He seems to be mumbling to himself and frequently making notes on a nearby pad of paper.  

//Thanks Drew!  You are a lifesaver!  I guess I should leave him to it though...  He wants to help me and academic research is definitely one of his strengths.//  Confident the situation is under control, you return to the living and room and lie down on the couch.

You fall asleep for a while and when you wake up it is dark outside.  You stumble back to the kitchen and find Drew still working in the same position you had earlier left him.

You walk to the fridge and push through several bottles of cola and finally find something suitable.  You pour yourself and Drew a glass of juice and cut up an apple into quarters and place it on a plate.  You serve Drew the healthy snack and he looks up with surprise as you approach.

“Taylor!  Oh…”  His eyes light up when he sees you… and then once more when he sees that you [[brought him something to eat.]]  “Thank you!”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="765" name="brought him something to eat." tags="" position="11948,19453" size="100,100">Drew drains his juice and takes a bite of a piece of apple.  He then excitedly begins to discuss every detail of what he had learned from the texts.  His verbosity and lack of explanation annoy you a bit but you let him speak until you finally manage to get a response in.

“So um, did you learn anything I can understand?  Maybe something that might be useful changing me back?  A lead of some kind?  A scientific breakthrough?”

“Well, um, uhh…” Drew hovers a pen over his notes as he reviews them.  “Not really,” he finally admits with a degree of embarrassment.  “Oh!  Maybe //this!//”  Drew opens one of the books and flips to a page around the back of the book.  He then eagerly taps his pen over [[a biography and the picture of a beautiful mature woman.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="766" name="a biography and the picture of a beautiful mature woman." tags="" position="12092,19543" size="100,100">“Doctor Fantasia Bloom,” you read the title. //Is that even a real name?//

“Yeah!  She is exceptional.  Dr. Bloom has revolutionized biomechanics.  I kind of wish you would have gotten her new book.  It was on the list I gave you at the top with a star next to it.”

“I don’t remember any damn star!”

“It was the most expensive one,” Drew clarifies.

“What did its cover look like?”

Drew’s face scrunches up as if you just asked him a very bizarre question.  “Huh?  Does that matter?”

“Uh, no… nevermind!”  You shake your head in embarrassment.  “So what’s the plan?  [[Why do you think she can help us?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="767" name="Why do you think she can help us?" tags="" position="11949,19605" size="100,100">“Fantasia is in town…” Drew informs you as he taps a few times on a nearby tablet before turning it in your direction.  “...and look where she just so happens to be giving a special guest lecture next week?”

“Whoa!  That’s our school!”

“Yep, quite a coincidence,” Drew remarks.

“It sure is….  So you think we should go meet her?”

“If we can.  We should attend her lecture beforehand… if we can get a ticket.  Fantasia Bloom is a very sought after speaker.”

“Oh, damn.”

“Don’t worry, I think I can get us tickets.  [[I know a guy in the Student’s Union who owes me a favor.]]”

“Wow, you’re so connected!” you sarcastically comment.  “But seriously, thanks Drew!  You’re awesome!”  Drew blushes and seems more than a bit embarrassed at your compliment.  “I guess I will see you next week then.  Whoo!  I feel so relieved now that we have a good lead!”

“Yeah, if anyone can help you, it is Dr. Bloom.  //If// we can convince her….  She is charitable though,” Drew adds reassuringly.

You thank Drew again and depart.

I recall something about a maid outfit //and// a nurse outfit.  Costumes, okay?  Clothes, bad.  Gotcha!  Someone is obviously in the closet about dressing up.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
You groan as you move through the store’s narrow aisles.  //Well, shit… I might as well get this over with and not prolong the inevitable.//

“We are here to dress up.  Part of the fun is trying on things you normally wouldn’t get to wear!” Julie explains.  “Ooooo!  This is cute.  Hmm this one is trashy and a bit slutty… mmm….”  Julie talks to herself as she sorts through various articles of clothing.

You step away and let Julie do her thing.  Just when you are about to check out a game store across the way, Julie calls you over.

“Go in there and try on what I picked out,” she orders.

[[You sigh and enter the changing room.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="771" name="You sigh and enter the changing room." tags="" position="12393,21400" size="100,100">Inside the tiny room is a massive pile of clothes.

“You have got to be fucking kidding me!”

“Nope!  Get changing,” Julie advises you from the other side of the door.

You try on a blue top but find it uncomfortably tight around the shoulders and reject it immediately.  

The next thing you pick up is a pink satiny gown.  “Who the fuck does Julie think I am?” you quietly wonder as you toss the pink thing away into the “reject” pile.  Soon that ugly dress has a lot of company.

“Oh this might not be that bad!” You say holding up a polka dot dress.  It looks loose fitting and comfortable… for a dress.  Just as you are about to try it on you notice the price tag.

“Five hundred fucking dollars!?” you explode.  “For this!?”  Even though you are annoyed at Julie, you don’t exactly want to squander your sister’s money.  “That is god damned criminal!”

“Taaaaaylor~!” Julie calls through the door.  “What the hell are you doing in there?  You haven’t showed me a single outfit yet!”

You look back to the pile.  Near the top is a white dress.  “Fuck me… I am going make a lot of psychologists rich after this...”

[[Try on the white dress]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="772" name="Try on the white dress" tags="" position="12245,21450" size="100,100">You step into the dress and shimmy back and forth, sliding the fabric upwards like a tube.  Just as you get it on and properly situated, Julie breaks into the changeroom.  

“Ooooo!  I love it,” she compliments your appearance when she sees what you are wearing.

“Fucking wow… this thing really hugs my body.  It feels so… //constricting.//  Why the hell do chicks wear this stuff?”

Julie points to the mirror.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taywhitedress.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Holy shit!”  Your mouth falls open as you inspect your reflection.

“Pretty much answered your own question, huh?” Julie snickers.  “Any guy that sees you will probably cream his pants at fifty paces.”

“That’s gross!  I am definitely not wearing this then!”

“But it is sooooo cute!”

“Julie -- I do not want to attract dudes!”

“Well, you’re a Roux.  You are gorgeous, so it will happen anyway.  Might as well have some fun and dress up, right?”

“No…”  //Dress up?  I am not eight years old, damnit!//

“Ohhh!  This one is my fave.  Every girl needs a little black dress in her bag of tricks.”

[[With a sigh, you try on the black dress.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="773" name="With a sigh, you try on the black dress." tags="" position="12393,21552" size="100,100">You change into the black dress, going through the motions much faster now that you have had a little bit of practice.

You feel very uncomfortable but the sight that greets you in the mirror is almost worth the discomfort.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayblackdressfront.jpg&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; height=&quot;975px&quot;&gt;
“Oh-my-god!  I looooove it!” Julie coos.  “Now spin!  [[Let’s see the back!”]]

“Your butt looks great in this dress!” Julie says with a laugh.

“Uh… thanks?”

“You’re welcome.  Now shake that Roux booty.”

“Uh…”  

“This is totally normal for girls,” Julie reminds you.

//Is it?//  After a second, you cave and give a Julie a little wiggle with your backside.

“What do you think?”

“I don’t know.  I can’t imagine wearing anything like this.”

“It is perfect then!  Now how about that red one next?” your sister suggests.

[[Try on the red dress]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="775" name="Try on the red dress" tags="" position="12393,21700" size="100,100">Thankfully, the red dress is surprisingly plain and easy to put on.  Aside from the black belt, it almost reminds you of TV shows from decades past.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayreddress.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Holy shit.  I look fucking ridiculous!”

“I like it,” Julie teases you with a smile.

“Well //I// don’t.”

“Oh come now!  Dresses are fun.”  Julie flips the front your skirt upward.  “See?  How many hot guys could resist this?”

//Julie… I am so going to get you back for all this.//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayredressbehind.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

“Lovely.  Just lovely.  [[Now how about that pink satin one?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="777" name="Now how about that pink satin one?" tags="" position="12394,21848" size="100,100">“I am not wearing //anything// pink,” you flatly refuse Julie’s request.

“Your loss.  Oooohh--did you want to try on a tutu?” Julie questions you with a wicked grin.  “It doesn’t necessarily have to be pink!”

“Fuck no!  Can’t I just get something normal that I would like and, you know, maybe feel comfortable in?  Winter is coming too!”

“What am I-- made of money?” Julie balks.

“You offered!  Are you going to let your … little brother freeze to death?”

Julie chuckles.  “Yep!  My little //sister,// on the other hand… //never!//  If you use those same moves on the boys I bet you will never use your own money again.  By the way, your stupid dragon show is terrible.  It is totally hilarious how often guys request a little roleplaying…”

“Gross!  I don’t want to hear about that!  This day is already awful enough as it is.”

“Haha!  Maybe we could dress you up like a queen for a day?” Julie suggests.

“Nooooooooooooooooo!” you howl, drawing several askance glances from other shoppers.

“Wow, Taylor.  You //really// need to lighten up,” Julie chides you.  You take a deep breath to yell at her but Julie preempts you.  “I have lots of jeans and tops at home, help yourself.  I will get you a coat too if you want, but this definitely counts as your Christmas present.  Now try on the rest of the damn outfits for me.”

[[You grit your teeth and play dress up for Julie.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="778" name="You grit your teeth and play dress up for Julie." tags="" position="12253,21890" size="100,100">One exceedingly awful hour later…

“See, that wasn’t so bad, was it?” Julie asks you without a hint of sarcasm.

You can’t even muster a reply.  You feel completely drained, like you have just spent the entire day walking through a desert with nary an oasis in sight.

“So, Taylor, which outfit did you like best?  You are getting one - whether you like it or not.”

//Well… all of them are pretty awful.  I might as well just choose one at random.//

You exit the store and momentarily taste freedom.  You start walking towards the nearest mall exit but Julie stops you short.

“We aren’t done yet!” she screeches at you.

“Oh come on!  I picked an outfit!”

“Mhmm, what do you want, a gold star?  We still need to go into //Elizabeth&#39;s Secret//!”

You feel an anime style nosebleed could begin at any moment.  You had always found these types of garments to be arousing and now you are surrounded by them.  The only thing destroying the fantastic moment is that you are now a girl.  //I want to tear these off a sexy woman in a night of passion!  I don’t want to be the fucking woman.//  You sigh.  //At least I am allowed to be in here without looking like a major pervert...//

Julie eagerly glides around the store, soon filing an arm up with clothing and pointing at the changing room.

Julie drapes the soft, white fabric over your front.  You give Julie one last hopeful look, but she stares you down until you submit. 

“[[Fine.  Let me change.]]”

“Oh-my-fucking-god.”

“You look great,” Julie opines.

“I look like I am wearing a fucking doily!” you mutter in frustration.  Julie snickers.  After admiring you for a moment, your sister passes you a red and black lingerie set.

As you hold out the articles in your hands you feel dizzy.  There is something undeniably erotic about a woman’s underwear... and something shameful about a man wearing it.

[[Try the red and black lingerie.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="785" name="Try the red and black lingerie." tags="" position="12246,22446" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayredblack.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Whoaa…”

“Falling in love with yourself yet?” Julie teases you.

As you stare at your reflection, you find yourself agreeing with Julie.  //No wonder good looking girls are so stupid and vain…  They probably can’t even fucking help themselves...//

“I love the feel of this one,” Julie remarks as she holds up [[a purple lingerie set with a floral pattern.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="786" name="a purple lingerie set with a floral pattern." tags="" position="12398,22492" size="100,100">“Put on the panties first.  And then these next,” Julie advises you, tossing you what appear to be socks.

“What the hell are these things?”

“Stockings.  Put.  Them.  On.”

You are beyond the point of giving a fuck.  You pull the tight fitting elastic fabric up your legs.

“Here.”  Julie hands you a piece of clothing you have never seen before.

“What the fuck is this?”

“It is a garter belt.  It holds up your stockings.”

You step into the belt and, with a bit of help from Julie, get yourself strapped in.

“What is the purpose of this thing?  [[Oh… right… looking… fucking hot...”]]

You resolve to take a lot of photos of yourself… and avoid your male friends as much as possible.  //If I can barely control myself, I can’t really trust anyone.  Let alone Evan or Drew… well, maybe Drew...//

[[“Now let’s see that booty!”]] Julie demands.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="789" name="“Now let’s see that booty!”" tags="" position="12246,22746" size="100,100">You place your hands on your butt and give Julie a little pose.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayund3.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

“Don’t worry, I won’t force you to pick.  You look so damned good in them all I will treat you this once.”   To your dismay, Julie purchases all three underwear sets for you.  Your eyes nearly pop out of their sockets when you see the $425 total price that Julie covers without batting an eyelash.

“Thanks… I guess?  Okay, I have underwear now.  Let’s get the hell out of here… //please//,” you plead with Julie.

“Don’t be so hasty.  We are getting you one last thing.”  Julie leads you into a store full of bathing suits.

[[“I am not going swimming!” you protest.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="790" name="“I am not going swimming!” you protest." tags="" position="12394,22800" size="100,100">“It pays to be prepared,” Julie imitates your father’s voice.  One look at Julie informs you that resistance is futile.  You are about to be assimilated by Julie the Borg and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

Julie shops for you as you watch on in horror.  She seems to make her decisions on what she picks based on how uncomfortable any particular suit seems to make you.

Julie holds up a yellow bathing suit that looks like it was made of ten cents of fabric.  //Only eighty fucking dollars!//  You can’t help but imagine wearing it and cringe hard.  You doubt the tiny straps would cover your areola, let alone your groin area.  //No self respecting person would ever wear something like that!// you fume.

You find yourself walking away from the swimming suits in a daze.  You find a bench and sit in the footwear section while you wait for your sister.

“I got you some different styles,” Julie says when she finds comes to find you.  “I found some one-pieces and a cute bikini,” Julie informs you as she leads you to a changing room and dumps a pile of clothes on the bench.

You start with what you guess is the most concealing suit.  It takes you a few minutes to pull the stretchy garment up and get it [[fitting comfortable on your svelte frame.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="791" name="fitting comfortable on your svelte frame." tags="" position="12246,22890" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayss.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

“Wow… Fuck!  This is supposed to be the less revealing option!?  This shit is //transparent!//”

“Ohhhh!”  Julie lets out an impressed catcall as she enters the changing room without your permission.  “Just wait until it gets //wet//!” she jokes.

“Oh god…”  You imagine wearing this sort of thing in public and quickly feel your face flush.  It is almost as bad as going naked.

[[Try on the second swimsuit]]

“What the fuck?  This is even worse than the last one!  I might as well just go naked.”

“That is an option!” [[Julie replies with a giggle.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="793" name="Julie replies with a giggle." tags="" position="12250,23050" size="100,100">“I am not wearing this!  It is //somehow// even worse than the last one!

“Taylor, part of the fun of being a woman is using our power.”

“Our power?”

“Bat some eyelashes and show a little //strategic cleavage,// and bam you got a man working day and night just to please us.”

“That sounds--”

“Great!  I know.”

“That isn’t what I was going to say--”

“Hush, Taylor, you are the one prolonging this adventure, not me.  I am having fun at least.”

With a sigh, you [[grab another suit from the pile.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="794" name="grab another suit from the pile." tags="" position="12390,23100" size="100,100">“Hmm… this one seems sort of complicated….” you note.  “And at least the fabric isn’t transparent!”  You run a finger over the strange rings binding the suit together.  //Well, here goes nothing...//

After a brief struggle, it is finally on.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayss3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;768px&quot; height=&quot;1152px&quot;&gt;
“Whoa!!”  //Hnnngh….//  You are shocked when you look at your reflection.  The mesmerizing peacock plumage colors make you dizzy…but not as much as the stunning woman staring back at you.  //Fucking hell...//  Your mouth now feels dry.  You feel so conflicted in that moment; you desire that woman looking back at you more than anything.  Your mind wanders and you briefly imagine what it would be like to fuck her…  //Damnit!  I can’t do this!  But… I just want her so bad… I just don’t want to//be// her.  Fuck!//    

“Holy shit, Taylor…  Even though you’re my sister, I am thinking of jumping you right now.”

“Fucking sick, Julie!” you cry out in disgust.  [[Julie nearly laughs her ass off at your distress.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="795" name="Julie nearly laughs her ass off at your distress." tags="" position="12250,23198" size="100,100">Finally, you try on the last suit Julie picked out for you.

You look down at the somewhat skimpy appearing suit with a frown.  //At least it isn’t see-through.  And this floral pattern isn’t that bad…  But this will definitely show off a lot of skin.//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayfbikini.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; height=&quot;1200px&quot;&gt;
The bikini’s small size is counterbalanced by its inoffensive design and colors.  It was a disconcerting clash of innocence and sex appeal.

It takes you a few extra moments to get the bottom piece tied off properly. The bikini leaves you feeling vulnerable, [[like you are one stiff breeze away from nakedness.]]

After a brief breakfast and uneventful walk, you meet Drew outside one of the science buildings.  You walk into the atrium before Deter’s class with Drew at your side.

You spot Evan and he waves at you.  As he approaches, he shoots you a weird look.

“What are you two up to?”

“Just waiting for another round of Deter’s madness,” you reply.

“Yeah, the last few lectures I have actually stayed awake for!  Our prof is clearly nuts.  I don&#39;t think I learn anything but I definitely get entertained.”

“The line between insanity and genius is often a fine one,” opines Drew.

“So… //you guys//…” Evan begins.  Although he uses the plural, he looks directly at you.  //At least Evan still thinks of me as a guy!//  “....doing anything later?”

“Taylor and I are attending the scientific lecture being given by the renowned Fantasia Bloom,” Drew replies.  “You are welcome to join us!”

Evan grimaces at the offer.  “That sounds //so// boring…” Evan comments as the students file obediently into the lecture hall like a line of ants.  “Probably not as boring as this class, though…”

The three of you take your seats.  To your delight, Deter’s class is even nuttier than usual.  Your professor goes on several crazy sounding rants about various conspiracy theories only tied tangentially to the lecture’s original psychology topic.

One very long powerpoint presentation and several insane rants later…

“Thank fuck that is over!” you say when class is finished.

“Cya around, Ev!”  You wave at Evan and then [[head off with Drew to Bloom’s lecture.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="802" name="head off with Drew to Bloom’s lecture." tags="" position="11199,24048" size="100,100">The two of you quickly make it to the other side of the building where the talk is to take place.  Outside the hall is a man checking tickets.

“Shit…” you curse.  “I forgot about the tickets…”

Drew smiles and produces two sweaty tickets from his pocket.  “I have us covered!”

“Heck yes!  Thanks, Drew.  You’re a lifesaver.”

You check your tickets and enter the hall.  Inside is a strangely festive atmosphere.  The lecture hall is absolutely packed.  

You find your seats and chat with Drew until the lights suddenly dim.  A moment later, [[a stunningly beautiful woman takes center stage.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="803" name="a stunningly beautiful woman takes center stage." tags="" position="11047,24142" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bloom.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Dr. Fantasia Bloom’s curves and blonde hair are eye-catching.  A tight fitting lab coat frames her bountiful breasts in a pleasing manner.

You notice Drew is staring at Bloom with a familiar look of rapture, [[once reserved only for you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="804" name="once reserved only for you." tags="" position="11195,24248" size="100,100">You frown, instantly feeling a bit jealous.  Not only was Fantasia stunning, but she was clearly more intelligent and wealthy than you ever would be.  You shake your head side to side. //What the hell do I care!?// 

Dr. Bloom begins her lecture with a nerdy joke.  Everyone in the room laughs except you.

“Hi everyone!  Introductions are probably unnecessary since you all paid a small fortune to be here today!” Dr. Bloom chimes in a pleasant, melodious voice.

You shoot Drew a dirty look but he is lost on the spectacle on stage.  //I thought this was free!//

“It is really good to see lots of young faces--and it is especially pleasing to see a lot of women here as well,” Fantasia continues.  She scans the crowd and momentarily gives you a subtle nod.  //Of course she singles //me// out as a woman!//  “You bright young people are this country’s scientific future!  Yesterday’s future is //now//,” Bloom dramatically declares as the video screen behind her flashes to life.

The //Elixir Technologies// corporate logo appears on screen written in flame wreathed lightning bolts.  //Ooo… uh that’s... sciency?//

[[A booming and very slick presentation begins to play.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="805" name="A booming and very slick presentation begins to play." tags="" position="11047,24290" size="100,100">“Elixir creates //transformative technologies// that disrupt several status quo industries and classic market dynamics.   Elixir has changed the world with advances in: cloud computing, micro-surgical robotics, longevity, water treatment, mining, space exploration and nanotechnology.”  //Hmm...//  “From cutting edge gene manipulation therapies to the outer reaches of space, Elixir is transforming the world.”

“I also have my own handbag line,” Fantasia adds from the sideline and the audience chuckles.

The last heading on the screen, nanotechnology definitely caught your eye. It seems a tad ridiculous that tiny machines might explain your transformation… but you have to concede it is within the realm of possibility, especially given what you know of Moore’s Law and the exponential rate of growth of human technological advancement.  Every year since your birth you had been amazed by the prolific miracles of science.  Every advancement seemed to make it a bit more difficult to tell the difference between real life and science fiction.

Your own transformation already confirmed it: [[the once unbelievable was truly possible.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="806" name="the once unbelievable was truly possible." tags="" position="11191,24392" size="100,100">As the video finishes, Bloom takes control.  She begins to explain a bit about her passionate motivation to change the world in a positive way.

Bloom is clearly a charismatic presenter.  The audience hangs on her every word as she briefly summarizes some of her recent achievements and accolades.  She shares a silly anecdote involving a conversation with a celebrity and the audience eats it up.

After about half an hour, Bloom begins to speak more about her company’s upcoming projects- various inventions and technologies that she believes will further change the world.  //And make her even richer… but what the fuck do I care if she gets rich curing cancer?  You go girl!//

You find yourself liking the amiable billionaire.  [[Drew seems equally smitten and you can’t really blame him.]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="807" name="Drew seems equally smitten and you can’t really blame him." tags="" position="11051,24458" size="100,100">An hour in, the enthusiastic Doctor reveals her Piranha Nanobot.  The amazing, microscopic robot is shown diving into a smiling patient’s bloodstream and devouring activated cancer cells.

The audience oos and aws.  You do too.  As the agile fish-robot gobbles up anything it identifies as “bad,” you lean forward in your chair so far you nearly fall over.

After the Piranha debut and a plethora of slightly sycophantic questions, Bloom concludes her talk to an adoring crowd.

Bloom receives a standing ovation.  By the end of the presentation, you are convinced that Dr. Blood is indeed one of the few people in the entire world that could potentially help you find a way out of your weird predicament.  //Now all I have to do is convince her...//

The Doctor is mobbed by people following her presentation.  You and Drew have to wait nearly an hour afterwards [[for your chance to speak with Bloom.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="808" name="for your chance to speak with Bloom." tags="" position="11200,24550" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bloom2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As you approach Dr. Bloom you suddenly feel incredibly nervous.  She is like a glorious lioness and the way she carries herself and gazes about the room leaves little doubt who leads the pack.  You swallow nervously.  //Do I dare approach the unapproachable?// you silently wonder.  Yet Dr. Bloom represents your potential salvation.  You //cannot// fuck this opportunity up.  You glance at Drew and can’t help but wonder if he might be a slightly more suitable negotiator under the circumstances.

You cannot let this chance slip away.  You decide to:

[[Let Drew take the lead.]]
[[Personally try and negotiate with Bloom.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="809" name="Let Drew take the lead." tags="" position="11052,24690" size="100,100">“What!?  Why me?” Drew completely balks when you make your request.  He looks as if you just demanded he hand you the moon.

“Because you at least understand the basics of all this shit!  You have followed her, you know way more about her than I do.  C’mon Drew, we both know you’re smarter than I am.  Please help me.  I need that great mind of yours,” you beg your friend.

Drew swallows nervously but finally nods.  “If it will help you…”

“That depends on the results.  We can’t fuck this up!  But I know you are the best choice, Drew.  I believe in you.”

“I don’t know about this…” 

“You will be fine!” you encourage Drew with a push forward, almost directly into Ms. Bloom’s ample cleavage.

“H-Hello Doctor Bloom!” Drew stammers in greeting.  Fantasia’s bright, intense eyes focus on Drew.  Drew looks horribly nervous, standing slightly hunched over in his slightly shabby dress.  Next to Dr. Bloom, Drew looks like a mismatch, [[more Fantasia’s opposite than her colleague or admirer.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="810" name="Personally try and negotiate with Bloom." tags="" position="11342,24646" size="100,100">Under construction.  Is it possible Dr. Bloom could see something in a more assertive Taylor?  We will just have to wait and see...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="811" name="more Fantasia’s opposite than her colleague or admirer." tags="" position="11208,24744" size="100,100">You see Drew wither under her attention.  “Yes?”  You watch Drew take a deep breath.  You can see droplets of sweat form on his furrowed brow.  His obvious distress makes you doubt your decision to let him take the lead.  //It is just my fucking life on the line, no pressure, Drew!  Fuck, I //really// hope I made the right choice!//

Just as Drew appears ready to implode, he looks at you and seems to calm himself.  “My name is Drew Drachmann,” he finally  introduces himself.  “And I want to say that I loved your lecture and reading your newest book.  I have long thought that you are the brightest of all the tech billionaires.  You make Elon Smell look like a witless moron.”

Dr. Bloom chuckles.  “Because Mr. Smell is a witless moron!  The //Mega-Loop// is a completely ridiculous idea… like most of his other harebrained schemes.  If he didn’t have those government contracts he would be toast,” Fantasia predicts.  “//My// company, on the other hand, has earned a profit every year since inception and made over //billion// last quarter.  Profit.  Yet, even though Mr. Smell has never earned a single dollar, his business is worth //forty// times mine!” Bloom complains, clearly annoyed at the fact.  “Paradoxically, the more he loses the more he is worth, and the more his cult of personality grows.  Dealing with his acolytes is absolutely dreadful.  I really hope he gets to Mars one day so we can all be rid of him, but I suspect he will be struck by one of his self-driving cars before he has a chance to enter orbit.”

You listen to Bloom’s off the cuff rant with surprise.  //Did Drew know about the rivalry between Bloom and Smell?// you cannot help but wonder.

“Yeah, uh… what an ...asshole,” Drew responds.  [[You shoot him an encouraging thumbs up.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="812" name="You shoot him an encouraging thumbs up." tags="" position="11052,24842" size="100,100">“Yeah!” Bloom agrees, pushing back a strand of her long hair.  “I like you!  What did you say your name was again?”

“D-Drew Drachmann, and this is my friend, Taylor,” he introduces you with a wave in your direction.

Fantasia’s searchlight gaze lands upon you and you suddenly feel stripped bare before this imposing woman.  “Hmm.  She’s pretty,” Bloom remarks after a moment of inspection.

“Yeah!” Drew readily agrees but deflates when you shoot him an angry look.

“Good to see a smart young man doing well for himself.  Your date is cute, kid.  So, what do you want from me?”  She cuts straight to the chase, suddenly all business.

“We aren’t...really… dating,” Drew explains.  “It is a bit awkward to ask, but my friend needs your help.”

Dr. Bloom’s smile disappears in a flash.  “Can she not speak for herself?” Bloom wonders, but doesn’t wait for you to reply, “Look, if you have some kind of project or idea to pitch then I will refer you to my staff.”

“No, that isn’t it.  Taylor isn’t a woman.  He //transformed// into one,” [[Drew lamely asserts and you mentally facepalm.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="813" name="Drew lamely asserts and you mentally facepalm." tags="" position="11212,24896" size="100,100">Dr. Bloom turns from Drew and looks at you with an expression that reminds you of someone who has just accidently bitten into rotten fruit.  “I see…”

You step forward to plead your case.  “We’re serious!  I got sick at school and then //this// happened to me!” You emphatically gesture at your subtly bouncing chest.

“Well, you look pretty great.  Most transgender men don’t turn out so well.  Who was your surgeon?”

“What?  //Surgeon!?//” you repeat the word with alarm.  //As if I would let some asshole cut my fucking dick off!//   “And I am not transgender!” you add.  //Or fuck… maybe I am… who the fuck even knows anymore?//  Your sense of self identity is in crises.  You realize this conversation is making your head hurt, so you desperately push forward in an effort to convince the doctor to help you.  “Please,” you implore the doctor.  “Just run some tests-- surely one of the greatest scientists in the world will be able to quickly figure out the truth.”  //A little flattery never hurt...//  “And maybe you will learn something that just might add a few billion more to your net worth.  I am offering you an exclusive peak.  Even if it was just surgery, aren’t you curious?”

At the mention of money, Bloom’s eyes flash greedily.  “Okay, you have piqued my curiosity!”  Dr. Bloom spins on her heel and begins to walk away.  You and Drew exchange a worried glance and then follow after her.

Fantasia walks along the halls, her long, elegant legs distracting both you and Drew.  Just as you are about to ask where she is leading you, Bloom turns off into the one of the [[catwalk connections into the university biolabs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="814" name="catwalk connections into the university biolabs." tags="" position="11052,24998" size="100,100">
You enter a seemingly empty section of the building.  Bloom walks to the end of a long hallway and accesses a tiny scanner.  She taps a key card carried in a lanyard around her neck and presses her handprint against a flashing screen.
Two double doors that you had not even noticed at the end of the hall swing open.

Dr. Bloom soon opens a second set of doors and leads you into a giant room filled with advanced computer and laboratory equipment.

“This is one of my own, the most powerful microscope on campus-- absolutely state of the art,” Bloom explains with a gesture at the largest machine in the room, a huge telescopic object that looks like it was ripped out of an observatory.  “You two are pretty cute.  Your clever plan worked!  You got to see my latest toy and here I am giving you two a personal tour.  You might as well pitch your idea.”

“We don’t have a project!  We weren’t joking, please just help us,” you implore the billionaire.

Bloom now seems to think you are crazy.  Her warm, patient exterior disappears.  Yet, Bloom is clearly an open minded woman.  She taps her lips thoughtfully for a moment and then smiles, but this time it is devoid of any warmth or hospitality.  Fantasia opens a nearby drawer and pulls out a small white object which she then hands to you.

You are now holding a strange pad.  Fantasia’s laughs at your vacant look.  “Prick your finger, dear,” [[she requests.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="815" name="she requests." tags="" position="11208,25044" size="100,100">“Oh, sorry… ouch!” You can’t help but wince as you prick your finger.  When Bloom holds out a glass slide, you take the hint and set the pad on top of it.  Bloom seals it within another layer of glass and carries it over to her immense microscope.

“I am impressed with your dedication.  You two are super cute.  It has been ages since someone took a practical joke this far.  I //love// jokes.  I just don’t want to //be// one,” she clarifies, ending with a menacing tone.

Fantasia places the slide in a small opening at the side of the microscope and then seals the compartment.  She taps a button on a nearby blinking terminal and the machine lights up and whirrs for a moment with a slight vibration.  You feel an uncomfortable tension in the room, like the crackle of static electricity.

With one last disparaging look at you and Drew, [[Bloom shakes her head and places her eye to the lens.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="816" name="Bloom shakes her head and places her eye to the lens." tags="" position="11052,25138" size="100,100">
Dr. Bloom’s jaw immediately drops.  “No //fucking// way!”  Bloom frantically fiddles with a control panel and rechecks the viewer multiple times.  “Holy fucking shit!  You have active nano-machines in your bloodstream!  I have never seen anything even close to this!  The level of complexity is… astounding!  They look like //spiders!//” Bloom remarks with amazement.  

//Ew… spiders… in my blood...//  You fail to suppress a shiver.

“So, do you believe me now?”

Bloom ignores you.  “The dexterity of the appendages is unbelievable… these things make my Piranha look pathetic...  What else is contained within your body?  How are these controlled?  Who made these?  [[Where did you get them?”]] the Doctor peppers you with questions.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="817" name="Where did you get them?”" tags="" position="11204,25200" size="100,100">“Where did you get these robots from?” Dr. Bloom repeats her last question with an iron edge to her voice.

“//Robots!?//  Like I said--I have no fucking idea.  I had this weird computer virus and then I got sick at school…”

“//This// school?”

You nod.

Fantasia’s eyes suddenly narrow, as if she had just come to a realization.  “//Deter.//”  Bloom’s long fingers ball into an angry fist.

“You think our psych teacher had something to do with this?” Drew questions Fantasia. 

“He is one of your teachers?  That is a huge coincidence.  He has to be involved in this somehow.  Do not trust anything that handsome scoundrel has to say!” Fantasia warns before falling silent, alternating between checking the view screen and eyepiece, still seeming to not //quite// believe her eyes.

“I need to get this sample back to my lab.  You should come with me too.  I can protect you.  If someone else gets wind of what these machines are capable of… [[you will become a prime target for lots of people you never want to meet.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="818" name="you will become a prime target for lots of people you never want to meet." tags="" position="10948,25334" size="200,200">You sigh and decide to be forthcoming.  “There are men in black chasing me,” you somewhat casually admit.
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
“That’s …”  //Distressing?  Yep.//  “//Exciting!//  You’re the real deal,&quot; gushes Bloom. &quot;You need to come with me right now.  I will call in a helicopter to meet us on the roof.  Don’t dally!  Let’s go-go-go!”

“Uh…”  //Holy shit!  From utter disbelief to offering to chopper me to safety in the span of five minutes!//  You look at Drew and he seems worried but content to let you make the big decisions.  “Drew…” 

Your friend inches closer to you, finally whispering in your ear.  “Go where you will be safe, Taylor.”

The truth is that lately //Drew// has been the one that made you feel safe.  Still, a billionaire has resources that Drew does not.  If you ever hope to change back into a man this is your best shot.  Surely this is an opportunity you cannot pass up.  You bite your lip and quickly think things over.  None of the options you can think of are perfect and each opens you up to potential dangers.

[[Refuse Dr. Bloom’s offer of asylum; accept her help]]
[[Accept Bloom’s offer]]
[[Try to work out a compromise]]x</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="819" name="Refuse Dr. Bloom’s offer of asylum; accept her help" tags="" position="10395,25749" size="100,100">You take a deep breath before speaking.  “Dr. Bloom, I appreciate any help you can offer in regards to my condition… but I cannot just go with you.”

“Why the hell not?” Dr. Bloom demands.

“It isn’t that I don’t trust you exactly…”  //Well I don’t-- not completely at least...//  The whole transformative conspiracy thing has made you necessarily a bit wary of just about everyone.  “I just want to stay on my own if possible,” you continue.  “I can handle myself with a few exceptions.  I like to be independent.  Surely a confident woman like yourself can relate to a bit of pride.  I want to change back into a man, but I don’t want to impose on you or let some other mysterious assholes dictate how I live my life.”

“Hmmph.  I can appreciate the sentiment but you should reconsider.  I am nice… //for the most part//, but my competitors have less scruples.  I urge you to reconsider.  You might end up in a jar.”

//A fucking jar!?//  You blink twice and swallow nervously but maintain your position. “I am sorry but I must decline,” you evenly reply.

“You are making a mistake,” Bloom warns.

You shrug.  //My conception might have been a mistake too!  Sometimes good things come from such things.//

“I am not going to change my mind.  I have made it this far on my own… and with Drew…”

“Well I am still taking that chopper.  I want to analyze this ASAP.  You two have piqued my interest.  I cannot guarantee your safety but I can assure I will do my best to uncover whatever secrets may lurk within this sample.  Just please be careful and [[don’t get abducted.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="820" name="Accept Bloom’s offer" tags="" position="11504,25740" size="100,100">You are in a dangerous position.  Your proximity has already put Drew in grave danger.  //If he were to die because of me… I would never forgive myself.  Drew has already been far too good to me.//

“Drew… thank you for everything.  Once I get this all sorted out I will owe you big!”

“I assume that means you have seen reason,” Dr. Bloom notes somewhat impatiently.

“Yeah, I will come with you.”

“Let’s go!  We can’t dally, we must secure the asset - that’s you- before someone snatches you away.”

With a sad smile and a wave over your shoulder, you leave Drew behind.  You let Fantasia whisk you away to the roof where, true to her word, a chopper is waiting.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chopper.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Seconds later you are soaring through the sky on your way to the estate of the infamous Dr. Fantasia Bloom.

You set down on a helipad next to a mansion on a several hundred acre spread.  The structures are all rich and high quality but not overly fancy, [[a bit like Dr. Bloom herself.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="821" name="“Your tongue is amazing.”" tags="" position="6882,8255" size="100,100">“Your tongue is //amazing//.”  You can’t believe the words that spill from your mouth.  //Fuck… that was definitely not the right thing to say at this moment.//

Julie laughs wickedly at your compliment.  “Oh, I am just getting started, babe!”  Julie gently pulls your T-shirt over your head and your breasts spill free, bare to the light and both of your eager eyes.  

“Is it hot in here?” you ask Julie, managing to stumble away and open a window.  A full moon is set in the cloudless night sky above.  You suck in a breath of cool night air but it does little to calm your fluttering heart and flushed skin.

“Julie--” your protest dies in your throat as your eyes focus on Julie’s figure.  She is slender but undeniably beautiful and curvy in all the right places.  Your sister is hot and so are you…in more ways than one.  //And now I have the hots for my sis?  C’mon, Taylor!  Snap the fuck out of it!// you scream at yourself but find your strength insufficient to break free from Julie’s spell.

With exaggerated, slow motions, Julie takes off her shirt and unclips her bra.  Your jaw and Julie’s bra simultaneously drop to the floor.  The two of you stare at each other topless, like twin goddesses bathed in dappled moonlight.  You feel yourself tense up.  You feel like you are now [[one kiss away from either a deadly heart attack or a shuddering orgasm.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="822" name="you foolishly add and Julie laughs even harder." tags="" position="6739,8305" size="100,100">“You know, I thought I was being a bit mean by stealing you away from my brother..

Julie gives you a stern look.  “Okay, Tay-Tam, what happened then?  You just magically transformed into a woman?”

“Apparently,” you reply, wincing.  //Fuck!  I sound ridiculous!//

“Hmm… there is an odd resemblance,” Julie remarks.  Your sis then scowls, her pretty face contorting into an angry grimace.  Julie’s eyes narrow at you.  “So, what the fuck then, Taylor!?  You p-pervert!  You make out with your god damned sister under false pretenses and then force me to go down on you!?  What the fuck, Tay?!”

“What are you saying?  //You// forced me!  You wouldn’t let me get a damned word in edgewise!  You just kept fucking kissing me!  You’re a hussy!”

“Oh my god!  You are actually being serious.  You are either nuts or… shit… Taylor has been MIA lately… No, no, no… this can’t be right….” Julie mumbles as she finally seems to connect the dots.  

“You little fucking twerp!” Julie hisses as she grabs you by the collar.  Your sister then cocks her arm back, fist ready to strike.

“What year was dad born?” [[your sister asks you through clenched teeth.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="823" name="your sister asks you through clenched teeth." tags="" position="6586,8402" size="100,100">You decide to answer truthfully since lying seems largely pointless at this moment.  You intend to take Julie’s rage like a man.  You sigh.  “Mid 1960s?  Maybe like ‘67?  His birthday is in May,” you answer.  As the last syllable leaves your lips, Julie punches you in right square in the face.  “Ow!!!  Fucking Jesus!  That hurt!” you yelp.  

“That is the point!” Julie screams.  Your sister hits you once more for good measure and you reel backwards and fall to the carpet.  When you touch your lips, the fingers return stained with blood.

//I guess… maybe I did deserve that… a bit...// you reflect.

“Taaaaaaaaaylor!” Julie wails.  “How fucking could you do this to me?  You are just awful!”

“//I’m// awful?  You aren’t innocent here either, you big slut.  You cheated on Ryan at the drop of a hat and you tried to steal away my girlfriend!  --Err... who you thought was my girlfriend!  Speaking of girls--I am a girl, sort of -- accidently--but fucking still-- what the fuck, are you a closet lesbo now?”

Julie sniffs disdainfully at your accusation.  “I&#39;m not in the closet.  I do what feels good and natural in the moment...Oh...uh.…”  Julie blushes furiously.

//Oh shit.//  The awful admission is laid bare on the table.  What you had done together with your sister had totally crossed the line.  Yet the truth was hard to deny.  Your bizarre, forbidden moment with Julie had felt truly amazing.  You now are aware that your time together with Julie has awoken a strange new attraction between you [[and the allure of a taboo.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="824" name="and the allure of a taboo." tags="" position="6737,8464" size="100,100">//But we are fucking siblings!  Everything is so...wrong… Fuck, what the hell have I done?//

When next you look up at Julie, you notice your sister has tears in her eyes.  “I can’t believe you!” Julie sobs into her cupped hands.

“Julie, I am so sorry.   I know I let this get really out of hand...” you apologize.

“But why did it have to feel so good?  Damnit, Taylor!  I //really// liked you,” Julie laments.  “And now you pull this shit on me and ruin everything.  You are so cruel.” 

Julie sounds so distraught it really strikes you and wounds you far more than the bruises and bloodied lips Julie has already left you with.

“Aw, Julie I do love you.  You’re my sister.”

“That’s right… I already love you… so if we do it, that isn’t really wrong, is it?” Julie rationalizes.

“Huh?  Wait, what?”  Your jaw drops at Julie’s rapid turn around.  [[“What are you saying?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="825" name="“What are you saying?”" tags="" position="6587,8555" size="100,100">“Taylor, I remember we used to have so much fun together… We used to be so close. You were my dependable little rock,” Julie reminisces. “I want those days to come back.”

“But…” //How is that possible now?//

“Let me finish! I don’t just want those days back. I want them to be //better//! We already love each other. There is nothing wrong with two adults pursuing their dreams.”

You can barely believe the words spilling from your sister’s mouth. “Dreams?”

“Yes! You’ve infected my //dreams//! Since I met this new you… I can’t think about anyone else. I have barely returned Ryan’s calls since I met you,” Julie admits. She suddenly pounces on you and, cradles your head like an addict would a crack pipe.

//Snnnnnnnnnnnnniiiffff!//

“Mwaahh…. Mmmm….”

“What the hell, Julie?! Get ahold of yourself!” Your sister’s level of erratic behaviour has just careened off the charts. “Are you drunk!?”

Julie rolls her eyes. “Hehehe… Self control has never been my strong suit.”

“That doesn’t answer the question.”

“I am stone sober. Happy? I do feel really good though… I think getting all that shit off my chest really helped.”

“Julie, you’re not acting right! There is something going on here!”

Your sister smirks. “We’ve got it going on~” she sings while swaying back and forth. “C’mon, Girl-Taylor! [[Let’s have some fun!]]”

This stuff is godly!//  You begin to eat slower, savouring every bite.  You are suddenly glad for your smaller mouth.  //It just means I get to enjoy this longer!  Just sucks I get to eat less overall…  Oh well, maybe I will live ten years longer if I do end up getting stuck like this.//  You begin to lick the ice cream as it melts, covering your delicate, pink tongue in yellow cream.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/icecream.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You catch Evan staring.  “Watching you eat that ice cream is //really// [[fucking turning me on!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="827" name="fucking turning me on!”" tags="" position="2596,17492" size="100,100">You stop licking the suddenly phallic appearing cone.

“Fuck, Taylor!  You’re so hot!  I want a blow job so bad right now!” Evan informs you.  “And another ice cream,” he adds.

“Go get one then,” you reply with irritation.

“I’d rather have both… and one more than the other.”

“Hah!  And I would rather be a man that just won the fucking lottery.”

“Taylor, please!  I will do anything for you!”

“Like what?”

“Well, I don’t know!  Maybe I could, like, buy you some things?” Evan suggests.  “I just got you an ice cream!”

“What the hell?  Wouldn’t that make me like your...?”  //Whore?//

“//Girlfriend?//  Well you kind of …already are in a way, right?”  Evan’s word choice stings.  “Look at how far we have come.  You might as well take advantage of me!  I know I have taken a few liberties with you along the way,” Evan admits.

“A few!?” 

“You just make me feel… crazy.  I get so… //hard// and frustrated around you I can barely control myself.  Being around you causes me real, [[physical pain.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="828" name="physical pain." tags="" position="2456,17582" size="100,100">“Good, you deserve it.”

“That’s //sooo// mean.  I am in distress here!  I might even die!” Evan predicts.  At first you think he is joking, but Evan seldom jokes about perverted things.  //Of course he is serious...// Your eyes are gradually drawn to the huge tent Evan has pitched in his pants.

You take a bite from the side of your dripping cone.  Evan is watching you with an uncomfortable intensity.  “Holy fuck, Evan, you are just… unbelievable.  Fine, pullover.  I am not getting killed in a car accident with your fucking dick in my mouth.”

“You mean it?  You are definitely my best friend.”

“Evan, please shut up.  You are not helping things.”

Evan pulls off into an empty parking lot.  With a disconcerting smile, [[Evan pulls out his huge dick.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="829" name="Evan pulls out his huge dick." tags="" position="2588,17636" size="100,100">You look at Evan’s cock and feel your mouth water.  You shake your head and mentally blame the ice cream.

//Fuck… why did I agree so readily to do this?//  You fear what answer you might come up with if you psychologically analyze yourself.  You look around to make sure the coast is clear and then lower your head down over Evan’s crotch.

Evan’s musky odor doesn’t stop your advance.  Your lips and tongue meet Evan’s glans and you are rewarded with a salty, slightly sweaty bead of precum.

You find it a tad disturbing the taste doesn’t even really bother you anymore.  //Fuck, I can’t believe I have gotten used to this...//

“Oh Taylor!  You are so fucking hot but--oohhhh shit!  Your mouth is still cold from the ice cream!  That feels amazing.  Uhh oh!  You have no idea…  You’re so good at that!  Uhh...”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taycarbj.jpg&quot; width=&quot;960px&quot; height=&quot;640px&quot;&gt;
You decide to shut Evan up and set to work.  You eagerly stroke his cock with now familiar motions.  You do your best to make your best friend cum and he obliges you, erupting inside your mouth with several almost violent spurts.  

The taste of Evan’s bitter seed overwhelms you.  //Oh… wow...//  You sit up with a mouthful of Evan’s semen.  It takes everything you have to suppress the urge to gag.

Evan is looking at you expectantly.

//He can’t possible expect me to….  Fuck, of course he does...//

[[You swallow Evan’s cum.]]

&lt;&lt;set $swallow1 to true&gt;&gt;
All it took was a simple swallow for a look of utter contentment to sweep across Evan’s face.  You feel sexy and powerful.

You notice Evan still has semen coated around his glans.  “That won’t do,” you murmur as you lower yourself and do clean up duty.  You slurp up Evan’s cream and lick his penis clean.

Evan is clearly in heaven.

When you sit up, you instantly regret your actions.  You doubt even a gallon of soda could wash the taste of Evan&#39;s sperm from your mouth.

“[[Let’s go.]]”

You luckily find some napkins in the glove compartment and spit out Evan’s load into a big, gross, gooey pile.  You throw the foul object out the window at a nearby waste basket and miss.  It sticks to the wall of the bin and you cringe.

Evan seems a bit disappointed that you didn’t swallow, but is probably well aware that if he complained after recieving a blowjob you would kick his ass.

“[[Let’s go.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="832" name="Let’s go." tags="" position="2592,17936" size="100,100">You and Evan continue your drive back to civilization. 

You find it difficult to make small talk, as you both seem to replay and digest the events of your stay at the cabin.  

You feel a mix of emotions that are difficult to separate from the giant, confused heap that they have amassed themselves in.  A part of you is ashamed.  Another is happy.  You’re confused, angry, guilty, and sad.  You feel sexy and corrupt at the same time.  //Is my relationship with Evan really fucked up… or much improved?//  It makes you deeply uncomfortable that you cannot objectively determine the answer for yourself.

Evan releases a deep breath and then begins to nervously fiddle with the radio.  After swapping through a variety of garbled music and boring talk stations, Evan throws up his hands in defeat.

“Watch the fucking road, man!” you shout at him.

Evan gives you a dirty look as he grabs hold of the wheel.  “I was watching the road!  I just wasn’t controlling the vehicle,” he specifies.

“That’s almost worse!  And don’t be such a damn nitpicker.  Please concentrate on driving.”

“I am!  You are //really// distracting though,” Evan replies.  He changes the subject with a small sigh.

“Well concentrate harder.  I am not doing anything.  I am just fucking sitting here.”

“Ahhh…. That’s enough.  You’re so close.  Every breath I take smells like you.  Every second thought I have is about you.  You make me crazy.  You are going to cause an accident looking like that.”

For a mere glorious second you feel like you are being electrocuted with pleasure.

You say nothing as Julie pulls off your soaked underwear.  “Oh… boyshorts?  And you got them all //wet!//” Julie teases you with a mercurial smile.  “Now Tammy… get ready because I am going to make you cum so hard you will be mine forever,” your sister declares with obvious determination.

“Julie~---ahh…. Jul--- ahhhhh…. //Julie!//”

“I love hearing my name called in ecstasy!”  Julie keeps //attacking// you like a succubus. Her kisses gradually drift lower, covering your aching breasts and collarbone in delicate, wet kisses.

By the time she reaches your belly button, you feel like you are on fire.  Just when you feel like you might actually die, Julie finally gives each of your inner thighs a sloppy kiss and dives [[right into the most sensitive area of your body.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="834" name="right into the most sensitive area of your body." tags="" position="6881,8406" size="100,100">Julie rubs your opening with reverence before wrapping her lips around your buzzing clitoris.  “Unnnngghhh!” you cry out as Julie’s masterful tongue works you towards oblivion.  To your sister, you are a mere open book.  Your sister seems to know exactly how to make another woman feel amazing, and you specifically seem to be the perfect test subject for her art.

Julie eats you out like the sex demon you now suspect she is.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/julieeattay.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You cannot help but grip the bedsheets and moan as Julie plays you like a fiddle.

“J-J-Julie!” you stammer as you begin to twitch as your body is placed into pleasurable autopilot.  As the pressure inside you reaches critical levels, with Julie’s ongoing determined caresses, you are soon pushed over the limit into release.  You lose control of yourself.  You gasp for breath as you buck gently against your sister’s face, pressing your swollen, wet lips where they can be better serviced.  You realize you now don’t give a fuck about anything except achieving your own satisfaction.

Your thighs tremble and your legs move awkwardly.  You want to hump Julie’s face, to feel her as deep inside you as possible, but you cannot even manage that.  Your shaking hand brushes Julie’s hair and the two of you lock eyes.

You suspect Julie is now grinning, although you cannot see the bottom portion of her face.  But you can definitely //feel// it, gently munching away.  //Oh no, no, no, no…//  

“Julie!  I am going to cum!” you breathlessly warn Julie.

“Good, cum for me, baby.  Show me how horny you are!  Show me how much you love my tongue!”

Then it finally happens.  You orgasm harder than you ever have before.  You suddenly feel euphoric, like you are being smothered by a tidal wave of opioids… only this is even better.  You shake, convulse, and shiver, flooding Julie’s waiting mouth with your erotic secretions.  You have never felt anything so intense before in your life.  

After a minute, you feel absolutely //drained//.  You lie in a pool of your own sweat and juices.  The last thing you recall before passing out is Julie’s beautiful, smiling face, framed within the silver moonlight.  Goddess or demon?  [[Heaven or hell?  You cannot tell.]]

//No, it’s even worse...//  “It’s //me,// Julie, //Taylor//!”  Julie studies your expression for an agonizing thirty seconds before she bursts out laughing.

“Aw, are you feeling a bit guilty about Taylor?  He is sweet but //trust me,// we will have more fun together than apart.  You had better not be breaking up with me!” your sister playfully threatens you.  //Or maybe not so playfully…//  Even though you have lived with her for essentially your entire life, you still often find it hard to read your sister’s often volatile emotions.

//Wait, did she say “breaking up?”  What the hell?  There is nothing to break up except this horrible misunderstanding!//

	Sophie informs you that cotton candy is her favorite.  She clearly loves the sweet treat and eats big bites from the cloud, replete with numerous &quot;Ohhs,&quot; and &quot;Mmms.&quot;  Sophie notices you watching her and, instead of greedily hoarding the candy like most her age, she breaks off the lion&#39;s share of cotton candy and hands it over to you.  You start to protest but she stops you with a giggle, &quot;You&#39;re bigger than me so you //need// a little bit more!&quot; she explains to you with childish logic that makes complete sense.  It was hard to argue with Sophie&#39;s twinkling pale green eyes.  You remember staring at those enthralling eyes and eating the candy, while savouring every bite.  In your memory, there is laughter and then a sudden scream.  Nearby, another little boy begins crying over a lost ice cream cone he accidently dropped to the ground.  You compact your cotton candy into a gooey pink ball and devour it as Sophie walks up the child and offers the tearful child the last of her own precious candy.  You recall the odd sense of shame and guilt you had knowing that Sophie, who loved the candy the most, received almost none of her own treat.  It was probably years until her next fair but yet you absolutely certain Sophie would still do the same sort of thing today.

	//Wow.   That was a really vivid memory.//  You have always really admired Sophie, so perhaps it wasn&#39;t that surprising that you were attracted to her as well.  Although you haven&#39;t seen her for a couple years, her absence regarding Craig&#39;s care is shocking.  You vaguely recall your mom mentioning some kind of fight they had.  That they still have not seemed to have patched things up surprises you because you know Sophie and the Bells fairly well and they are definitely an open and [[very forgiving family.]]

Probably due to the erotic effort expended on you already, Evan’s cock is soon near it’s bursting point.  

“Uhhhhh Taylor~!  I am coming!  Ahhh!  Fuck yeah, take it all….ooooh yeah!” Evan shouts as he suddenly reaches climax.  Your mouth is suddenly  flooded with a salty, bitter taste.  Most of Evan’s huge load lands on your lips and you are forced momentarily to breathe through the thick strands.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumonface.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
As Evan looks down at you with ecstasy, a part of you goes even further off the rails.  You can’t help but smile and stick out your tongue, giving Evan’s cum a playful little swirl.

“You’re the greatest friend ever…” Evan gasps.

“I know.”

“You know what Taylor?  I think I could totally get used to this!  We could just like totally meet up every day and--”

“Fuck off man!  The last thing I want is to get used to this!”

“What if you’re stuck like that.  You might not have a choice.  Better to just make the best of it and have some fun along the way.”

You sigh, wondering if Evan is in fact correct.

It appears Sandra has forwarded &quot;Tammy&quot; your email with an enthusiastic acceptance.

Taylor sent me this glowing email and recommended you.  You sound just like the angel we need.  I am really desperate and something very important has come up tonight.  I could really use you tonight if you are free! I know it is short notice but… did I mention I am desperate? Pretty please?  How does 5pm sound?  I will make it worth your while,&quot; Sandra writes before adding dozens of incomprehensible emojis.

&quot;Damn, sounds like she is really in a bind…  How can I say no to that?&quot; you muse.

&quot;I think it is really admirable you help your friends… that is why I am here for you too, Taylor.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Drew.  Heh.  I am going to head out, but I will text you later and we will definitely pick up where we left off.&quot;

&quot;No problem.  I will do a little research if I can.  I already have a few ideas...&quot;

&quot;Drew, thanks!  I will message you later once I take care of this.&quot;

&quot;I would love to help out!&quot; you email Sandra back.  About a minute later, she messages you back with a hundred heart emoticons and directions to her house.  With a final wave goodbye to Drew, you slip out of the house and begint to walk towards the [[Bell&#39;s residence.]]

&quot;Um… Hi…&quot;

&quot;Wow.  You&#39;re Tammy?  You&#39;re so pretty!&quot; Sandra gushes.

&quot;Thanks… you aren&#39;t so bad yourself!&quot; you joke.

You even manage to get a few excellent hands but no one seems to want to risk potential nakedness and embarrassment.  It seems everyone is playing fairly conservatively… except for Evan.

He seems determined to get at least one of the three women at the table to show some skin.  Evan bets aggressively and in the 6th hand you finally goad him into going “all in,” a particularly Evan-esque strategy.

You lay down your straight flush with a grin.

“Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccckkkkk!” Evan howls.

“Hahahahahaha!  //Strip!//” Rhea orders.  “Evan, you big loser!  Lose those clothes right now!”  Evan turns beet red at Rhea’s words.  He awkwardly fumbles with his clothes as you focus on his hilarious facial expressions and obviously intense embarrassment.

“Heh!  I would much rather have taken your money rather than your clothes but this is pretty hilarious,” you tease the boys as [[Evan awkwardly uses a nearby pillow to cover his manhood.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="845" name="Evan awkwardly uses a nearby pillow to cover his manhood." tags="" position="2347,9897" size="100,100">“That’s cheating!” Rhea catcalls as she tries to snatch away Evan’s pillow.

A new hand is dealt and Jimmy and Evan exchange worried glances.  You toss Evan a chip with a look of pity so he can continue to play.

You win a few and fold a few hands but keep your stack and clothes intact.

Rhea seems increasingly annoyed at the lack of nudity until she can no longer contain herself.  “Okay everyone!  Bonus round: whoever wins this one gets to pick one piece of a loser’s clothing to be removed,” she announces.

“What the hell?” you protest but everyone around you rumbles agreement.  “Fine, whatever.”

Of course, you naturally lose the next round to Rhea… who you now suspect has probably cheated.

“Alright, Taylor, take that shirt off and let’s see those boobies!” Rhea demands.

“You have got to be fucking kidding me!  You cheated, didn’t you?”

“How dare you accuse me of cheating, you bitch!  Now don’t be a sore loser and take off that shirt for us.”

For a split second, you feel like a tea kettle that has reached a boil.  Instead of hissing in frustration, you manage to calm yourself with a deep drink of beer.

“Okay, fucking whatever…. God damned cheating Rhea…” you grumble [[as you pull your T-shirt over your head.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="846" name="as you pull your T-shirt over your head." tags="" position="2206,9939" size="100,100">“Whoa…”  You hear a sudden sharp intake of breath from all four men at the table.  You notice Evan shift uncomfortably against his pillow.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bra.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Very nice!” Rhea compliments you as she oggles your chest along with the guys.  Whether it is the beer or the attention, you feel your face and ears flush until you feel like you are burning.  The only one who doesn’t seem interested in your figure or teasing you is Samantha.

Sam seems to read the direction of the game.  She overtly checks her watch and bows out.  “Sorry everyone… I uh… have to be up early tomorrow,” Sam lamely explains.

“Boo!  Now our game is unbalanced!” Jerry protests.  As Sam departs, you begin to feel a tad foolish.  //So much for impressing Sam… or seeing her naked… Oh well... //  

You are now low on chips but still fairly keen to play.  For some reason, you have a strange feeling you will be lucky if you keep going.

“Okay, let’s continue,” Robbie says after draining his beer and crumpling the can gracefully against his forehead.  [[You laugh at the ring imprint it leaves behind.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="847" name="You laugh at the ring imprint it leaves behind." tags="" position="2346,10045" size="100,100">With a swishing sound, Jimmy rapidly deals out a new hand of cards.  You pick yours up and cannot help but grin.  //Three of a kind right off the bat...//  You decide to bet strongly but are soon eclipsed by richer players.

“Hey, Jimmy, can I borrow a few of them chips?” you request, eyeing his burgeoning stack.

Jimmy rubs his patchy facial hair.  “Will you pay me back?”

“Oh course!  My word is my bond,” you attest.

With a confirming glance at your bare cleavage, Jimmy seems to make his decision.  He pushes five $10 chips towards you.  You play another four or five hands while enjoying a few more drinks.  You find your stack grows somewhat and that you are having a pretty good time.  Each fresh drink and handful of cards seems to distance you a bit further from reality.  //One more win and I can pay Jimmy back.//

At the start of the next round the cards are swiftly dealt and you immediately feel you are in a familiar strong position.  

You find yourself going head to head with Robbie.  You stare at your opponent, attempting to read his mind by his expression and body language.  [[You are soon outbid and out of chips.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="848" name="You are soon outbid and out of chips." tags="" position="2202,10087" size="100,100">“Ohh, Taylor is //out//.”  //Fuck!  And I have like the greatest hand ever.  I need to play!//

“How about a round on credit,” you suggest.

Everyone balks at your request.  “Your only option is to bet your clothes,” Evan informs you.

“Uh…”  You glance between your cards and the faces around the table.  You decide to make a compromise.  “Fine, but I call.”

“So you are betting two pieces of clothing?” Evan clarifies.

“Yeah, whatever!  I got this though.  Now let’s see those cards, Robbie.”

Robbie sets down a hand that narrowly defeats your own.  “Fuck!”

“Strip!  Strip!  Strip!” a drunk sounding Rhea shouts.  You give Rhea a look of disbelief.  //How the fuck is she still fully clothed?//

//I should probably quit after this round like Sam… better to be safe than sorry!//  You throw your socks on the table.  “There!” you proclaim.

Evan scowls.  “Socks count as one article of clothing.”

“Fuck no they don’t!  There are //two// of them!” you argue.

“Sorry Taylor but Evan is right,” Jimmy disagrees.  “We are going to need you to take those pants off,” he adds in a mock-stern voice.

Rhea howls with laughter at Jimmy&#39;s call.

“You are all such pervs!  Especially you, //Evan//, and you, //Rhea.//”  You shoot both of them an angry glare.  “I will take my pants off but that is it.  I am at my personal limit tonight.  [[This is as naked as I fucking get.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="849" name="This is as naked as I fucking get." tags="" position="2344,10191" size="100,100">“We will take it!” Evan readily agrees.  Jimmy chuckles at Evan’s eagerness.

Under the gaze of your friends, you awkwardly take your pants off.  One of your legs gets caught as you tug them off and you nearly stumble over.  You suddenly feel dizzy and stagger back to the card game and sit down.

“One more round?” Robbie prompts you.

“Nope, like I said…”

“That’s fine, this one can be just for fun,” Robbie insists.

“I don’t need your charity!”

Robbie deals out some cards and includes you in the hand.  You are beginning to sense an uncomfortable atmosphere in the room.  You decide not to go any further.

Yet you still have cards in front of you.  You can’t help but peek.  Your jaw nearly drops.  Counting the river cards you almost have a high straight flush.  The urge to reverse the game and get some payback becomes nearly overwhelming.

“Okay… how about one hand on credit?” you request.  

“Sorry, Taylor…” Evan apologies as he gestures at his remaining solitary chip.

The other players mull over your proposal.  Robbie is the first to speak.  “That is cool but...  [[If I win, you have to do something special for us.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="850" name="If I win, you have to do something special for us.”" tags="" position="2201,10242" size="100,100">Robbie’s tone makes you scowl.  You resist the urge to smack him.  “Fuck no!” you respond.  Yet you still look down at your strong hand and seriously think about accepting.  You aren’t super great at math, but you would bet you would win well over 9/10 times with cards this good.  //I almost can’t lose.//  You visualize yourself walking out with a big pile of chips and glory, with all your friends crying and grovelling naked before you.  //Yeah… that would be hilarious...//  Even if you lose, these are your friends, and you bet that you can play it off as a joke even if you do in fact lose.  “Deal,” you spontaneously decide.  //Shit, I had better fucking win…//

As a king appears in the river, you cannot help but exult.  //I win!//  “Alright, let’s see whatcha got!”

You set down your straight with an ear-splitting smile…. Which promptly disappears when Robbie lays his cards on the table.  

Your jaw drops.  “Royal-fucking-flush,” Robbie announces with a shit eating grin.

“Fuck me…”  //Why the fuck did I agree to this!?  I am so stupid, damnit…  even if it was a high chance I would win I should never bet fucking bet my pride… or my life.//  

A nervous tension and silence dominates the room as all the men eagerly look to you.  They try to gauge your reaction and wait for you to to respond.

“Heh…  Um, about before... I was totally joking earlier!”

“You aren’t getting out of this!” Robbie angrily rejects your refusal.  “You are going to give us all blowjobs,” [[Robbie matter-of-factly decides.]]

“You’re the one that has been teasing us all night.”  Robbie suddenly stands, unzips his fly, and takes out his penis - which for some reason is rock hard.  //Whoa!  This is really fucked up!  I have to get the hell out of here right now!//  “Don’t be a pussy and go back on your word,” Robbie badgers you.  “You promised, a deal is a deal, someone’s word is their bond - what happened to all that?  I had you pegged as a woman of your word, I guess I was wrong about you.”

//What the fuck!?//  You look at your friend’s impassive faces searching for an out.  You find none.  //Do these guys really want me to… suck them off?  That is so fucking sick I don’t even know where to start!//  

“Taylor, are you the kind of person who backs down from a dare or a promise?” Evan muses.

“What?  You guys are fucked up.  //Please// [[tell me you are joking.”]]

The scene is so fucked up and random you almost can’t look away.  //What is wrong with //me//!?//  

You tear your eyes away from the erect penises and look to Evan for help.  You instantly realize you will get none from your friend; he seems hopelessley drunk and aroused.  He seems to have one of the biggest boners of them all.

//I can’t believe these fucking perverts!  If they knew I was a guy...//  Evan’s erection proves he doesn’t care.  You can’t imagine a sudden admission would improve your circumstances.

Robbie is dumbfounded.  “That chick is totally nuts…” 

“What the fuck just happened?” you hear Jimmy pose the question right before you slam the door and sulk off down the street.

You feel warm, giddy, and drunk.  This moment aside, you have had a lot of fun tonight.  You decide not to let these assholes ruin it.  //Still… I really don’t want to touch another guy’s dick… let alone //multiple// fucking dicks...//  You shake your head as you realize that a part of you is already acquiescing to these idiot&#39;s absurd demands.

“C’mon Taylor!  Suck it up and suck those dicks!  Ha-ha-ha!” Rhea encourages you from the side lines.  Your eyes are drawn to Evan’s obvious protrusion.  You notice all the men clearly have erections straining to be free.  And all four of these perverts are now staring directly at you, as if you alone are to blame you for their discomfort and arousal.  //This is so fucked up!//  Only Evan knows the truth about your transformation… and he clearly doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered by the circumstances.  

You feel obligated to honor your word and agreement, regardless of its vagueness.  Every tense, agonizing second seems to gradually erode your resolve.  “Fuck… a deal is a deal,” you say when [[it finally caves in.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="855" name="it finally caves in." tags="" position="2198,10540" size="100,100">“Oh shit yes!” Evan and Jimmy high five as they see the tide shift.

“I am not going to give you blowjobs though--that is just fucking sick!” you warn them.  “I can already smell those gross things from here.  I am not putting a dick in my mouth.”

“Aww, don’t be a prude!” Rhea criticizes you.

“But you will help us get off?” Robbie finishes your sentence, making it only a slight question.

You nearly choke when you try and answer.  “Yeah…” He manages to pry your single word reply out of you.  You feel a bit ashamed and excited at the same time but your own arousal is clearly but a fraction of your peers.

//Ugh… I should have stayed home tonight…  What should I do?//

The men will probably be satisfied if they get to ogle your gorgeous naked body for a bit…. //I hope...// &lt;&lt;set $stripcheck to true&gt;&gt;

“Okay… I will show you guys what you want to see…”

The men watch you like hungry wolves observing a lamb.  You suddenly feel hot.  //Is it stuffy in here?// you breathlessly wonder.

Perhaps it was because it was easy to put yourself in your friend&#39;s shoes.  //I might as well help these losers out...//

“Hell yeah!  I knew this chick was awesome,” Jimmy attests.  Your friends fumble with their belts and pants.  A few seconds later, you have four very hard looking dicks pointed directly at you.  Your breath catches in your throat as you look on and the sober reality of your commitment catches up with you.

There was a part of you that thought your friends would be grossed out by your transformation.  Now it is plain they have a different reaction to your new appearance.  When they look at you, it is clear that they only see what they want to see.

Still, sucking dicks is gross.  Let alone sucking //four// damned dicks.  Even though you have narrowly avoided that awful scenario, you have still committed to //touching// them which is almost as bad in your book.

Evan and Robbie step forward.  “Ew!”  The sweaty smell catches you off guard.  //Yeah, there is no way in hell I can do this!//

“I am dying here, Taylor… just touch it...please!” [[Evan whines.]]

You let the guys ogle you for what seems like ages before before you begin to feel smothered by the tense atmosphere in the room.  It is obvious these wolves want to see more flesh.

You look down at your panties and feel exposed.  //They have already seen so much… I might as well keep going...//

The room becomes eerily silent except for hard breathing.  Even Rhea silently admires your figure.  It isn’t long before Robbie begins to stroke himself.  Evan joins in a second later and, within moments, you have four drunk men jerking off to your visage.  

This is definitely one of the weirdest moments of your life.  “What the fuck, guys!?  Get ahold of yourselves!” you castigate the perverts but your words only seem to encourage them to seek their own pleasure.  

“Uhhh!!  Ohh fuck!” Jerry groans as he begins to ejaculate in his palm.  You watch on in disgusted, confused horror as Jimmy follows suit.  //This is so fucked up!  My friends are masturbing to me… I am making them cum just by standing here...//  You feel surprisingly conflicted, but your disgust quickly overwhelms any feeling of [[power you may have once presumed.]]

&quot;I see.  I am partial to the odd game myself,&quot; you admit.

&quot;Really?  That&#39;s r-really cool!&quot; Craig replies enthusiastically, like a big hyperactive kid.  &quot;What kind of games do you play?&quot;

&quot;Um, usually whatever is fun!&quot; you answer vaguely.

&quot;I like fighting games.  What kind do you like?&quot;

&quot;RPGs!&quot; you answer.

Craig&#39;s face falls.  The name seems to trigger a nervous reaction.  &quot;Sophie liked RPGs too…&quot; Craig laments.  His use of the past tense makes you raise an eyebrow.

One thing has been bothering you.  &quot;Where is your sister?&quot; you ask Craig directly.

&quot;Sophie!?  I… oh… uh...  The--ey-- the Bells-- doo-n&#39;t let me see her anymore…&quot; Craig whines while his face scrunches up as if he is in pain.  He tenses up and suddenly refuses to look you in the eye.

Craig&#39;s mannerisms are giving off a very uncomfortable vibe.  You can&#39;t seem to help yourself from pushing on a bit further.  &quot;Why?  Where is Sophie?  What happened to her?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to be bad,&quot; Craig begins to explain.  &quot;Sophie always used to take care---of me.  Now I don&#39;t see her.  I think she is mad.  Sandra too… everyone is always mad me,&quot; he relates with a sigh and a sorrowful tone.

&quot;That must be hard for you,&quot; you reply.  Craig seems unwilling to speak anymore about the topic.   //Sophie is a gentle soul...I wonder what Craig could have done to make her hold a grudge like that...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hello.jpg&quot;&gt;
You give Craig a reassuring smile.  &quot;I am sure it will be okay…&quot;

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot;

&quot;Sophie is a forgiving girl,&quot; you answer as Craig slumps over.  You think a change of topic is necessary.

You look at Evan and Robbie’s sweaty faces and suddenly feel a new emotion.  //Fear...//  The two men loom dangerously above you.  

Robbie begins to gasp as the speed of his pumping increases.  “I-am-going-to-cum!” he announces.

“Ew!  Get away from me!” you shout as Robbie begins to orgasm, spraying your leg with semen.  “You fucker!”

“Oh fuck that was awesome…” Robbie opines as he falls down onto the couch, joining the other satisfied men in a near comatose state.

“What mods did you get?  Can you fly a helicopter?”

“That is a secret.  Needless to say I have about a dozen expert level proficiencies, but I don’t like to brag.”

“I am not sure I believe that last part,” you reply with an eye roll.  The Envoy chuckles at your response.  “So… what’s on the chip?” you ask when you finally work up your courage.

“This particular chip is a “splitchip.”  Instead of containing a single master level skill it has several smaller mods included.  About a quarter of it is a basic combat education.  You won’t be an expert fighter by any means but you should be able to defend yourself even if you were once a couch potato.  You never know what will happen, so it pays to be prepared.  Since your target will have sophisticated security, there is a substantial allotment of espionage and infiltration skillwork taught from the point of view of an expert spy.  This splitchip also includes a large observational section with maps of all the necessary facilities included as well as a staff lists and other useful information. This chip has about two thousand hours of additional experience with hacking and network information systems.  I will also include some intelligence tidbits about our organization and some of the industry players as a little bonus, too since you are so... //brave//.  Having this will make your impossible mission become merely difficult.”

You can’t help by swallow nervously.  //I really hope I made the right choice...//

“I will leave the specifics of the infiltration up to you,” the Envoy continues.  “I am sure you can think of any number of //ingenious// ideas.”

[[“I will just have to do my best…”]]

This mission could be very dangerous and without it you could be injured or killed… or worse, //fail the mission//.  If you get the chip, you will have more than enough skills in your mental toolbox to accomplish your goal.  Without the computer skills included in the chip, the amount of time it will take you to access the relevant data will increase significantly--along with the danger!  Of course, it is your choice whether to get the implant but I would have grave concerns about your safety and potential survivability if you rely on the standard courses alone.  Believe me, I have your best interests at heart!  Frankly, it would take years to train you properly.  Yet we only have a mere weekend… anything you learn will be, at best, superficial.  Who knows what you will be up against out there?  I would urge you not to half ass this.”

//Holy fuck am I really considering getting a fucking brain implant?//

The Envoy makes excellent points.  Still, the idea of having a chip implanted in your brain is not only super creepy, but also a risk in and of itself.  //Hmm… but it might well be the less risky alternative.  I don’t want to fucking die… or screw up this mission.  Besides, the Envoy says there is no side effects… and if I become a badass superhero in the process, how the fuck could I turn that chance down?  I have always dreamed of kicking a bit of ass!//

Most of our agents have at least one of these mods.  The only real downside is you can’t have very many of them.  A soft cap of three is recommended.  Anything really beyond that we have noted some slight abnormalities.  There are a few that have chosen four or five… but anyone with six or more tend to become jittery and unstable.  I imagine it is because there is only so much experience one mind is able to process.  Or perhaps it has to do with how we distill the information from its original subjects, perhaps when layering too many imprints atop one mind it is only natural the receiving subject becomes confused.  But don’t let these warnings discourage you!  One of our best agents has ten modchips… he is amazing but also frequently unfit for work because he has developed a multiple personality disorder.  So just try and keep it at three or less for now,” warns the Envoy.

You gulp nervously.  “Does this chip go where I think it does?”

The Envoy gives you a pointy-toothed grin.  “But of course!  It is injected right into your brain!”

You wince.  “That sounds painful… and risky… and just //bad//…  I like my brain the way it is, thank you very much!”

“Except this is already a proven process.  There has never been a single incident.  The modchip has the same fatality rate as marijuana.  The injection is shallow and painless.

“Wait a second…  You don’t mean…”

“Yes, I am afraid so, Mr. Roux.  You will have to learn to dance… and maybe sing too, one way or another.  For the sake of your mission, I suggest you do it well and get the chip.”

“I want to pick a different mission!”

“Really?  That is fucking awesome man!” Gil laughs as he begins to unzip himself.  “I haven’t been blown in like...days, man.”

“No fucking way!  Please no!” you protest.  You look to Mitch but he ignores your pleading stare.  Being his bitch was bad enough, but what are you supposed to be now?  Mitch’s whore?  Are you now his prostitute to be doled out as a casual favour to his minions and friends?  //Fucking wow….//  You feel like you are in a bottomless pit with nothing left to do but succumb to the infinite fall.  //Fighting is pointless,// you despair.

“What are you waiting for?” Mitch asks you, his face contorting into a scowl.

You just can’t bring yourself to do it. “Fuck!  Just, no, Gil is fucking disgusting,” you complain.

“See?  Didn’t I tell you man?  Such a dirty mouth… it probably gets a bit cleaner with a big ol’ dick in it,” Mitch jokes.  You hate them both so much.  Yet here you are, held firmly in their clutches.

Both of the powerful men surrounding you are staring at you, silently commanding you to obey or face repercussions.

“Please…”

“Stop your whining and start //sucking//, Taylor!” Mitch sternly orders.

You resist the urge to cry.  You kneel before Gil with a sick feeling in your stomach.  Every new low you achieve you somehow manage to undermine and fall through to a new, lower level of depravity.  You give Gil a look of malice but he just grins dopily at you.

Your left hand wraps around Mitch and begins to jerk him off, as if led by a mind of its own.  You give the two bullies an awkward dual handjob for a couple of minutes, adjusting your efforts to pleasure both men at the same time.  

“Suck it,” Mitch orders and you immediately obey, taking his hot precum soaked glans in your mouth.  “Haha, told ya she was pro!” Mitch says to Gil.  “Now don’t stop jerking! he advises you. “We aren’t landing a rover on the fucking moon, this isn’t complicated,” he caustically adds. 

You continue to work on Mitch’s dick while fondling Gil at the same time.  You give Mitch a sloppy blowjob, the sound of your sucking and licking is soon the loudest noise in the room, overshadowing the TV playing in the background.

“Huhh… Huhh…”  You stop momentarily for a breath but Mitch forces you back down his shaft.  You choke and gag before he releases you.  The next thing you know, Mitch pushes you forward and Gil’s rock hard dick is pressed against your lips.

He proceeds to fuck the back of your throat with a dozen hard thrusts and then, when you attempt to withdraw your head, he pulls you back and holds your mouth over his cockhead.

Your neck muscles strain powerlessly against Gil’s superior strength.  You look up at Gil and find his blissful, lust filled expression to be of no help.  It is obvious what he desires and you have no choice [[but to give him what he wants.]]

It is a bizarre balancing act.  One that slightly distracts you from the awful scenario unfolding around you.

//Ughh...fuck!  Two at once… Mitch alone is bad enough… but now I am sucking off Gil too!  God damnit what has happened to me?  I belong in a fucking asylum!//

After about five minutes of sucking and pumping, your mouth is full of salty thick saliva.  You are now only thinking about pushing these assholes over the edge.

“Uhh!  Faster!  Fuck!  I am cumming!” Mitch announces.  You stroke them both like a crazy porn star.

“Oh, man!  Me too!” Gil echoes.

//This is so fucking gross and humiliating...//  You close your eyes as two of the people you hate most in the world cover you with their semen.

Each bully shoots an immense load.  You are quickly blinded by reproductive fluid.  //This is definitely one of the worst moments of my life...//

“Wow that was fuckin’ great!  Thanks for sharing your slut, bro!  Now that I know you have this hottie cocksucker here I will have to come over more often!” Gil jokes.  //I //really// hope he is joking.//

//Oh fuck me!  How could I be so damned careless?  Shit!  This guy just makes me uncomfortable he is throwing me off my game a bit...//  You know you will have to react quickly to repair this hole in your cover.

You do your best ditzy girl impression.  “Well you are just like //so// famous!” 

Lucas grins.  “I am not //that //famous,” he replies with faux modesty.  Lucas studies you intensely for a full thirty seconds.  He seems to appraise you and deems you worthy of his time.  “Are you going to sit down… uh, Taylor was it?”

//Ugh… I shouldn’t have used my real name either….//

With butterflies dancing in your stomach, you sit down across from Mr. Ferret.

Lucas waves over a waiter and orders you two drinks.

“I am fairly famous within my sector but I am a bit surprised [[a young woman such as yourself is so well informed.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="906" name="a young woman such as yourself is so well informed." tags="" position="8583,11603" size="100,100">You stiffen at the implication.  //Fuck, there is only one really good way I know will work...// “Your hobby is technology… mine involves strong, powerful men…”  You try and be suggestive without going overboard.  

Lucas seems to take your response at face value.  A moment later, your drinks arrive.  

A strange looking fruity cocktail is placed in front of you.  You take a sip and are pleasantly surprised at the bold, sweet flavor.

“So, Taylor, are you from around here?”

“Uh, no… I am actually here for school.”

“Oh.  What are you studying?”

//Argh.  Be vague!//  “A little bit of everything!” you respond.  When Lucas doesn’t seem pleased with that response, you add, “I am fond of science.”

[[Lucas’ eyes twinkle.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="907" name="Lucas’ eyes twinkle." tags="" position="8433,11649" size="100,100">“I am as well!  But I think you already knew that, right?  So what interests you?”

You do your best to make conversation with Lucas, which is surprisingly difficult.  He seems to frequently steer the flow of words towards personal details about yourself while constantly making reference to your appearance.

After your third round of drinks, you think you are making progress.  //That might just be my buzz though…//

You talk about a variety of seemingly random topics.  When Lucas finally goes to the washroom for a moment you use the time to collect your thoughts… which are promptly re scattered when Lucas suddenly returns and sits beside you.

“What are you doing for the rest of the day?” he asks you.  Mr. Ferret runs a hand down your inner thigh and stops just an inch away from your underwear.  “You know… I have a suite nearby if you would to like to have an unforgettable experience.  I am considered a tech genius,” he brags.  “But I must say: I am way better at sex than any of the tech stuff, ha ha ha!”

You stiffen and then freeze completely at his touch.  You imagine you look quite a lot like a deer caught in a vehicle’s headlights.  It takes great effort for you to resist your urge to break Mr. Ferret’s fingers.

Luckily Lucas seems to read your unease and walks back his offer.  “How about a rain-check and your [[phone number instead then?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="908" name="phone number instead then?”" tags="" position="8581,11743" size="100,100">//I really don’t want this creep having my number...//  An idea pops into your head.  “How about you leave me a business card instead?” you suggest.  Mr. Ferret mulls over the idea.  He doesn’t seem very keen to mix business and pleasure.  “I would just //love// a memento!” you gush.

After a moment, Lucas reaches into his back pocket and produces a bright business card.  It reads in minimalist style, “Lucas Ferret, Trans Corp Chief Technology Officer.”  In microscopic print below it lists a phone number and email address.

“I am usually free in the afternoons around lunch,” he explains, as if passively inviting you back for another lunch date.

“I appreciate the offer, Lucas.  I am in a bit of a hurry though… I just saw you there and had to say hi…”

“That is a real shame.  Perhaps we could meet again tomorrow?”

“Uhhh… maybe…”  You manage to withdraw from his touch.  //If I come back tomorrow this creep will try and grope me!//  “I will let you know!”  You stand up and put a few feet of blessed distance between you and your target.  “I really do have to go now though!  Thanks for the drinks and the snack!”

Mr. Ferret looks disappointed but [[smiles sadly and waves you off.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="909" name="smiles sadly and waves you off." tags="" position="8581,12057" size="100,100">Your heart is still beating rapidly even once you have escaped the restaurant and put a block in between you and Mr. Ferret.

//This is going to be way harder than I thought!  What the hell am I going to do now?//  You find yourself walking in the direction of campus.  No matter how hard you rack your brain, you cannot seem to imagine a realistic way into Ferret’s life that doesn’t involve you sleeping with him.

You decide to talk to Deter and call the whole thing off.  //I am not letting this old man grope me...or rape me!  Nothing is worth that!//

When you arrive at Deter’s office you knock and enter.

“Taylor, how did you do today?” Mr. D says after a curt hello.

“Badly.  Yeah, I don&#39;t think I can get your old buddy’s phone,” you inform your professor without further exposition.

Mr. Deter grimaces.  “Why in the hell not?  Just go and fuck him and take his phone while he is asleep,” Deter suggests with irritation.  “This isn’t even complicated at all.  I am surrounded by imbeciles.”

“What!?  I am not going to...//fuck him!//  [[Sick!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="910" name="Sick!”" tags="" position="8418,12096" size="100,100">“Why not?”

“Because I am a fucking guy and that is //gross!//  And I can’t just, you know…”

“I care not for your preferences.  Man the fuck up and do what is necessary.  Or else I might have to resort to other measures.”

“Fuck you and your threats.  You make it sound so easy.  I don’t see you volunteering to take a gross dick up your ass.”

“You don’t have to take it up your ass.  Use that lovely vagina of yours.”

“No way…”

“Why not?  There are no consequences.  You might even enjoy the experience.”

“Easy for you to say, asshole!  You aren’t the one that has to do it with an old dude.”  Suddenly an absolutely horrifying thought occurs to you.  “What if I got fucking pregnant?”

“That is what I meant by “no consequences.”  You //cannot// get pregnant.  [[Conception is at the agent’s discretion,]]” Deter explains.  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="911" name="Conception is at the agent’s discretion," tags="" position="8570,12202" size="100,100">Deter’s statement makes you blink.  “Huh!?”

When you just stare on in disbelief, Mr. Deter sighs.  “As a //spy,// it is in your best interest to not get pregnant.  Having a baby interferes with espionage,” Deter explains, speaking slowly, as if to a small, particularly stupid child.  “But, for long term infiltration missions and in certain scenarios, getting pregnant may be necessary.  It is now merely a conscious choice.  So keep your fucking thoughts in order, you degenerate.”

“You mean--”

“Yes, you must //want// to get pregnant in order for it to happen.”

You blink twice as the implications set in.  “That’s crazy… imagine if all women could do that.”

Deter shrugs.  “It is inevitable.  Pay attention to current trends and it is easy to predict the future.”

You try and imagine a world where only people who want children have them.  “Our population would definitely decline,” you predict.  “Fuck, half my friends were accidents.”  You thoughtfully tap your lips for a moment.  “So… just //hypothetically// how is this triggered?  Do I need to like meditate or something?  Should I be watching videos about contraception to [[build up a tolerance?]]  This is fucking nuts!”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="912" name="build up a tolerance?" tags="" position="8422,12248" size="100,100">“Hm.  You lack the mental discipline of a regular agent, so I would be particularly wary.  You must keep a clear state of mind and purpose.  I would give the same advice to a natural female- if you use a condoms a thousand times there is fair chance that at least one of them will fail.  Do not let yourself give in to lust and your new feminine instincts.  In fact, you should abstain from repeated intercourse if possible, or at least wait until you are more accustomed to your new sense of self.  Medically, I would advise that you completely abstain from sex if at all possible - but I know that you&#39;re young and horny. Everything is fine in moderation - but just don’t get carried away.  If you want to have a tumble, use protection. Stay focused, you never know what might happen if you let yourself go… you might end up making yourself even more fertile and perhaps even causing a pregnancy that otherwise may not have existed in the first place.”  

//Holy… Talking to Mr. Deter makes my head hurt.//  You sigh and mull over your thoughts.  //So I can’t get knocked up… unless my mind wanders…  Fuck, good thing I don’t have ADD.  At least it is a bit comforting to know that I have a degree control, or at least more than I thought.  I can do what I want and experiment a bit… Wait… Ew… Not that I would or anything… just the option is there.//

You are not just a powerless man trapped in a woman’s body… you are far more.  You are now capable of marvelous transformations.  You have enjoyed the pleasures of the female and form cowered in fear of the consequences of your actions.  As a woman you had routinely felt weak and small, but no longer, for it appeared you could enjoy the fruits of chance without risk… as long as you kept your mindset clear.  You suddenly feel powerful and sexy, confident that no matter what form you take on you will have fun.

//I am never fucking getting pregnant!  Mwahahaha! I can have all the sex I want!//  Still, you cannot help but wonder if that is in fact [[a very mixed blessing.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="913" name="a very mixed blessing." tags="" position="8566,12350" size="100,100">“Complete reproductive freedom is the future,” Deter predicts.  “Eventually both a male and female will control their respective reproductive rights and have full choice over sex and conception.”

“So you mean a guy will have control too?”

“Yes, it should be a simple modification to render a man’s sperm inert.  Conception will require the consent of both parties - quite an elementary evolution [[if you aren’t a nincompoop.”]]

//Wow Evan is pretty huge..  Why the heck am I looking at his penis?//  You shake your head, suddenly feeling dizzy.  Your feelings of shame and disgust begin to fade away.  Evan’s erect dick seems to take up more and more of your vision.

Evan stops masturbating, letting his cock bounce free.  “Please help me, Taylor!  I am almost there- don’t leave me hanging!”

After everything that has happened, it is hard to turn down his request.  Your thoughts seem scattered and incoherent.  It is hard to focus on anything [[except the dick in front of you.]]

With a shaking hand, you reach out and grip Evan’s hot shaft.  Being a former male and porn connoisseur, you know more or less what will make Evan feel good.  You jerk off Evan’s cock with your soft hand and massage his balls at the same time.

Evan’s penis feels impossibly hard. You can feel Evan’s pulse through your handiwork. You feel dizzy as you stroke Evan faster and faster until you find that you are breathing just as heavily as your friend.

[[Evan clearly loves your efforts and his moans of pleasure encourage you to continue and refine your movements.]]

With barely any warning aside from a groan and a pulse of precum, Evan suddenly unloads all over your face, covering your delicate features with thick, white semen.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanfacial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Wow…”  //What the hell have I just done?// you silently wonder as Evan’s cum drips down your lips and chin and on to the carpet below.  //I am drunk and naked… and I just took my best friend’s load after helping him jerk off...//  You feel like you are in shock.

The dull paralyses lasts until you become conscious of the now unbearably fishy odor that assaults your senses.  You resist the urge to gag and dash off to the bathroom where you spend fifteen minutes blasting your face with hot water.  Despite rubbing your face red with soap and water, you still feel unclean.  //Fuck my life!//  You hope your relationships aren’t ruined.

When you peek outside the bathroom, Evan is standing nearby.  He looks incredibly guilty.  Barely meeting your eyes, he hands you your previously discarded clothes.  Without a word, you snatch them out of his hands and retreat back into the washroom and change.  

Afterwards, you leave the party and have a long walk of shame home, haunted by a storm of conflicting thoughts and emotions that threaten shatter your self identity into pieces.

[[Head home|Pass time]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="918" name="Evan whines." tags="" position="2494,10691" size="100,100">“Fine, I will help you fucking perverts out.”  You wrap your soft, slender fingers around Rob and Evan’s cocks.  It almost seems like you are in some sort of bizarre, parallel reality.  //I can’t believe I am really doing this…  I must be really drunk and really stupid...//

You now have a hot penis in each of your hands.  You feel you have gone too far to turn away now.  You gradually start to move your hands up and down the shafts.

“Oh, Taylor... fuck that feels good!” Evan encourages you.  You soon find yourself gliding up and down his shaft faster and faster.

Suddenly two more dicks appear, assailing you at once.  As Jimmy and Jerry step up, Evan takes his place directly in front of you.  You look up at Evan and he shoots you an unsettling grin.  Surrounded by the four large men, you suddenly feel small and weak.  Not wanting to unnecessarily prolong the event, you continue to give Evan a handjob.

“Oh yeah that feels great!  Keep going!” Evan moans.

“Yeah, keep going!” Rhea mimics the cry with a cascade of feminine giggles.  “That expression on Taylor’s face is priceless.  Don’t just stare at those dicks, honey!”

“Don’t forget about us, babe,” Jimmy grumbles as [[he strokes his dick near your face.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="919" name="he strokes his dick near your face." tags="" position="2353,10789" size="100,100">You turn your attention to Jimmy, giving his long, slender dick several soft pumps.  He was already hard from the moment you touched him, but after a moment you feel even more blood flow and fully engorge his member.  His hot cock comes alive in your hand.

//Oh shit...//

“C’mon…”

“I only have two hands!” you complain.

“Then use your mouth.  Please just suck on it a little bit!”

“No way!  You guys should be grateful I am doing this for you at all!” you complain while continuing to pleasure both Jimmy and Evan.

“She’s right… just let her do her thing.  Uh… wow you’re hands are magical, Taylor.  Just wait your turn guys, it will be worth it,” Evan advises.

You come to the gradual realization that this is all taking too long.  You don’t want this ordeal to be something you vividly remember.  You are starting to feel tired.  Your wrists are already sore.  You just want the night to end but it is obvious it would be [[impossible to leave without finishing.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="920" name="impossible to leave without finishing." tags="" position="2501,10839" size="100,100">You change positions and kneel, alternating your attention to Robbie and Jerry.  You barely even know Jerry and now you have his dick in your hand.  You can feel the blood flow to their cocks, encouraging them to swell to their limit.  You notice how small your hands look in comparison to the massive dicks you now hold.  You are beginning to reach a new level of embarrassment.  You feel drunk and uncomfortably warm.  //I have to end this before everything escalates!//  You jerk the two men off as quickly as physically possible.

It doesn’t take long before your efforts pay off.  Robbie is soon thrusting forward in a counterryhym to your hand job.   “Oh fuck!  I am going to--”

“Ew!  Don’t!” you shriek, letting go of the dicks you are holding and leaning backwards just in time to avoid Robbie cumming all over your face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockpov.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Holy shit!  Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Robbie howls as he ejactulates.  You watch his cock spasm with morbid fascination.  You space out for a moment and the next thing you know, [[Jerry begins jerking off to your face.]]

He pathetically fills his hand with semen, luckily preventing any of the foul substance from touching you.  Jerry gives his dick a few final strokes before falling backwards onto the couch.

“Heh!  Lightweights!” Evan teases as he and Jimmy step forward again.  “Now you can focus on the main show.”

“Evan…”

“C’mon, Taylor… you made me like this…”

“I am sorry…”  You sigh and brush the hair from in front of your eyes.

You lean forward, ignoring Jimmy for the moment and [[focusing all your attention on Evan’s rock hard dick.]]  //Why is he so aroused…?//  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="922" name="focusing all your attention on Evan’s rock hard dick." tags="" position="2495,10993" size="100,100">You smother Evan’s dick with your soft hands and give him the best cock massage you can.  It only takes about a minute of genuine effort before Evan announces he is about to cum.  His warning comes too late and you don’t have time to withdraw your hands.  Evan’s cock bulges in your hands before proceeding to unload a disgusting amount of cum all over your pale fingers.  The fishy smell of Evan’s semen assaults your nose.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hjcummie.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
“Jesus!  That is so much fucking cum…”  Why the heck would this oaf cum so much for you?  You cannot dare to imagine what this may imply.  Either Evan //really// likes you or he was mega pent up.  //I just made Evan orgasm...//  You feel so mixed up that you may never be quite right again.

Jimmy hands you a tissue and you wipe Evan’s seed off you.  When it is obvious one tissue is woefully insufficient to clean yourself, Jimmy passes you the box.

Once you are clean, Jimmy’s thrusts his dick forward.   //Oh man… this is so fucked up!  This never ends!  I can’t believe I am helping these guys get off.  Damn… that’s right!  If I just hurry… this will all soon be a distant memory.  [[Just one more… I can do it]]...//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hjc.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
“Whee…. Thank fuck that is over with!”  You feel somewhat proud but your achievement is undermined by its very nature.

You notice Rhea has her cellphone out.  //Fuck!  I forgot about her!  Was she… filming us?  Oh my fucking god...//  You feel yourself burn up with embarrassment.  //Just how much did she record?  Fuckity-fuck!  Even a split second is far too much!  Damnit!  I look like such a goddamn whore!//

“Doctor,” the unusual number of chefs acknowledge &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Dr. Bloom&quot; &quot;Dr. Bloom desc&quot;&gt;&gt; as she passes.  At the end of the kitchen, the busty scientist approaches two huge freezer doors.  The Doctor nods at a gigantic man, who looks more like a guard than a cook… (Unless he was the type to eat nearly all of his own cooking.)

With a loud clicking sound, the freezer doors swing open, revealing what appears to be a secret passage leading into an underground area.

“You know, if I was rich I would totally build a secret passage too,” you comment.

The Doctor chuckles.  “The destination is far more impressive than the passage itself.”

You follow the doc down an uncomfortably long staircase, descending deep into the underground.

“This is my real home… [[my personal laboratory!”]]

“Heh, save it for after the exam.”

“What exam?”  

“We are going to get you a proper gyno exam, just to be thorough.”

“Uhh… I would rather pass on that.”

“You don’t really have much of an option…  You scratch my back and I will scratch yours, okay?”

“Ummm... Fine.” //What the hell is a gyno exam? Sounds sinister...//

Her features become serious.  “This lab does have a western wing but it is //very// dangerous.

The whole damn wing is worse than any war zone.  Fair warning.  Do //not// go in there unattended unless you want to die.  Am I understood?”

“Yes, ma’am.  Step into the western wing and I will die… probably,” you repeat.

“Not “probably!”  You //will// die!” she angrily corrects you.  Dr. Bloom takes a moment and regains her composure.  “I have a uh… //mini// Hadron Collider in the third room down.  It isn’t exactly legal and it throws off some awfully nasty particles sometimes…” Fantasia admits.  “And then there is quantum splitter thing…. And then the--- Ahhh let’s just say please don’t go in there unless you have a serious deathwish.  If you want to kill yourself for science though that is totally cool with me!  Just please let me know in advance so that I can set up instruments and prepare a cleanup crew,” she adds happily.

//Dr. Fantasia Bloom … what a fearsome woman.//

“Okay, here we are!” Fantasia announces happily as she leads you through an [[unremarkable white door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="928" name="unremarkable white door." tags="" position="11499,26048" size="100,100">Inside the room is a smiling young woman in a brilliant white lab coat.

“Hi there Taylor!  I am Dr. Lauren.  Why don&#39;t you get undressed and put on one of our gowns.  Then hop up there on the bed when you are ready.

“I don’t think I will ever be ready…” you grumble as you step behind the curtain and change.  

“Underwear off, obviously,” Dr. Lauren advises.

“Yeah, yeah…” //Wait why &quot;obviously&quot;?//

A minute later, you awkwardly lie down on a strange bed.  

“Whoa!” you yelp in shock as Dr. Lauren touches your leg while brandishing a horrifying medical instrument.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/speculum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“What the fuck is that?”

“It is called a //speculum.//  We are going to use it to have a little peek inside you.”

“Inside… me?” you repeat the words, alarmed at their implication.  “Uh… I don’t think that is a good idea!”

“It is perfectly normal, my dear.  Women routinely undergo such procedures…” Lauren somewhat dryly adds.

You wince and nearly cry out as the [[cold metal spreads you apart.]]

You begin to count sheep in an effort to distance yourself from the sensation of cold, foreign metal exploring the genitals you shouldn’t even possess.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pussyexp.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Taylor, the speculum is a bit much. I don&#39;t want to tear you. Please just hold yourself open so I can inspect your genitals.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Even though the situation is clinical, you are still  embarrassed.

“Any abnormalities?” Dr. Bloom wonders.

“Hmm… not that I see,&quot; Lauren answers.  &quot;She looks very healthy and all the flesh looks completely natural.  Part of her hymen is still intact too…  I would like to take a scan too, just to be safe,” Dr. Lauren requests.

After an hour of tedious hospital procedures, you finally are allowed to get dressed.  You overhear Dr. Lauren arguing with a colleague.  It is clear there topic of discussion is //you.//  Or your genitals, rather.

“You see that?” Dr. Lauren snaps.

“I don&#39;t see anything!&quot;

&quot;Look closer!

&quot;Hmm…yes, now that you point it out, Dr. Lauren, there is something there.  //A fallopian cyst//.  You have an uncanny eye, Doctor.”

“Not just one, //look.//&quot;

“What!?  There’s another one and it is...in the exact same position in the other tube,” remarks the second doctor.  The man sounds completely mystified.

“//Mirrored// fallopian cyst//s//.”

“That’s //remarkable!//  The chance of that occurring…”

“Is effectively zero,” Dr. Lauren concludes.  “Yet there it is right in front of us.”

&quot;There is no way in hell that is natural...  Just what happened to this young woman?&quot;

The male doctor answers. &quot;Your cysts effectively block conception. I don&#39;t think it is even physically possible for you to get pregnant,&quot; he bluntly explains.

&quot;//PREGNANT!?// Fuck…Well that&#39;s a relief then I guess...&quot; You fail to suppress a shiver of discomfort.

&quot;Well, be that as it may, I have never seen two cysts in the exact same location. They almost look like a birth control implant. So we would like to redo some targeted scans and perhaps use a camera to investigate…&quot;

&quot;Ew… I would rather not stick anything up there...&quot;

&quot;We will just have to manage with scans then. How heavy are your periods?&quot;

&quot;My //periods!?// What the hell kind of question is that? I have never had one… Thank fucking god…&quot;

The doctor seems intrigued. &quot;You have //never// had a period?&quot;

[[&quot;I am a man!&quot; you angrily reply.]]

There is the sound of shuffling inside.   You smile faintly, reminded of several similar motherly intrusions in years past.  Your mom often seemed to time such moments for the second right before you were about to cum.  &quot;C-Come in!&quot; Craig answers after a few seconds.

Craig&#39;s eyes light up when he notices you. &quot;Wow...&quot;

Sandra introduces you.  &quot;Hello Craig.  This is Tammy… uh, what did you say your last name is?&quot;

&quot;Uh…&quot;  //Fuck!  Think, Taylor!//  &quot;Gerr...hubel…&quot; you mumble and instantly feel like an idiot.

&quot;Tammy Gerhubel,&quot; Sandra repeats and you cringe at how awful the name sounds.  //Fuck that was definitely not my best moment…//  It appears you are now stuck with that awful last name.  At least it might be easy to remember.  &quot;Tammy, this is Craig.&quot;

&quot;H-Hi!&quot; Craig greets you, his broad features morphing into a docile grin.  &quot;You are really pretty,&quot; Craig compliments you.

&quot;Uh, thanks!&quot; you answer cheerfully… or rather as cheerfully as you can muster.  &quot;Hi Craig… I have heard a lot about you.  I think we will get along great together!&quot;

&quot;Okay, I will let you two get acquainted,&quot; Sandra interrupts.  &quot;I am just going to get a few things ready.  I will be right back!&quot; Sandra informs you.

&quot;You smell good,&quot; Craig says once Mrs. Bell leaves the room.   &quot;R-really good.&quot;

&quot;Uhh…&quot;  The very odd remark catches you completely off guard.  Even after about thirty seconds of thinking about it, you still have no idea how to respond to it.

You feel like you have been spun in a circle until you have lost your senses.  //Why the fuck did I agree to this!?//  “There is no way I can do this….”

“I guess…”

“I am not stopping until we have enough to eat tonight and some to take home,” you insist.

“That could take all day!” Evan objects.

“So what?”

“Fuckin’ fish,” Evan pouts, as if jealous they are stealing your attention from him.

After a grueling elimination process, you finally pick your fish hook:
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lure.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Fuck yeah!  If I was a trout I would //totally// eat the shit out that delicious looking… orange fuzzy thing… fucking fish, they definitely deserve to be eaten!&quot;

Once set, you begin to fish.  You cast as far out as you can.

“Do you even have a fishing license?” Evan asks you.

“I don’t need one of those,” you reply.

“Huh?  Dude they would like impound my car if we get caught!”

“Don’t worry.  I have this covered.  If we get busted by the… //fish police //or whatever, I will just say I am one five thousandth Cherokee-- that will shut them up quick and confuse them while we make our escape.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="941" name="“Let’s push the canoe out!”" tags="" position="2146,15694" size="100,100">“How about a canoe adventure?” you suggest.  It seems like a fair compromise between a hike and fishing.

Evan’s face brightens.  “Oh, that might be cool!  Good idea!  I always wanted to be a pirate.”

“I don’t think many pirates used canoes…” you reply drly.  The two of you walk over the where the canoe was stashed last year in a nearby shed.  “Holy fuck this is heavy!” you huff as you try and lift up one end of the hefty fiberglass vessel.

“Is it?” Evan wonders as he effortlessly picks up his end, nearly causing you to drop yours in the process.

“What the hell, Evan!?  Fuck!  You ripped it out of my damned hands!”

“I am uh… sorry?  I guess I just don’t know my own strength.”

The sudden reminder of your weakness annoys you.  “Asshole…” you grumble as you struggle to move the canoe down to the water’s edge.

You and Evan return to the shed and grab a pair of paddles.  You then pack a cooler with lunch and an ample supply of “barley beverages.”  As you are about to lock up, you notice that there is only a single, child sized life jacket inside the cabin.  “Well, I guess you get that…” Evan says as he tosses you the bright yellow item.

You are about to toss it aside, but change your mind.  //Evan isn’t exactly the most experienced or eager sailor...//

“Why not?  It is a beautiful day.”

“Yep!  A beautiful day with a beautiful woman,” Evan replies.

You roll your eyes.  “So, are you going to fish with me or not?”

Evan’s gaze lingers on your chest a bit too long for your comfort.  “Yeah, fish!  Great!  Whatever!  At least the bugs aren’t bad out here-surprisingly.”

At your request, Evan carries over a humongous tackle box and some fishing rods.  He then disappears back into the cabin as you mess around with selecting a suitable lure.

You try and brush off her concerns as bravely as possible.  “Hah.  That is not on my to-do list.  With your help, I think we should be okay.  Thank you, Dr Bloom!  Please let me know what you uncover.  I fear if I have to stay like this much longer I might start going a bit… uh… //soft// in the head, if you know what I mean.”

Bloom’s face brightens.  Her bright red lips transform into a brilliant smile.  “Oooh!  Maybe you are refusing my offer because you still want to have a bit of fun in that new body of yours.”  Dr. Bloom bites her lip and shoots a sidelong glance at Drew. 

“T-That’s not true!” you stammer.  You feel yourself flush with embarrassment.  You look at Drew and note he shares a similar shade of embarrassment.  

Bloom laughs at your reaction.  “Coming with me doesn’t preclude experimentation, it necessitates it!”  You flare bright red again and silently applaud your own bravery.  You are confident you made the right choice; if you went with Bloom, you might end up in a lesbian sex dungeon.  //Err...//

“Are you okay?” Bloom asks you.

You snap out of your reverie.  “Y-yeah!  Fine!”  //I was totally not just daydreaming about lesbian sex dungeons!//

You and Bloom exchange phone numbers while Drew observes the interaction with a look of wonder.

With your blood occupying a slide in her breast pocket, Bloom concludes the transaction with an assurance she will have some something to report within a week.  The beautiful billionaire strides off and you and Drew both can’t help but watch her lovely round ass walk away.

“Taylor!  Why didn’t you go with her?” Drew suddenly asks you.

You bite your lip.  “I don’t know,” you answer.  “Just a feeling, you know?”  It is the closest to the truth you can get.

“What are we going to do now?”

“Well… now that the most pressing issue is potentially being solved while we wait….”

[[“Maybe we should catch up on our gaming!”]]
[[“I have a few things I would like to take care of.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="944" name="“Maybe we should catch up on our gaming!”" tags="" position="10398,25935" size="100,100">Drew’s eyes light up at you suggestion.  “Really?”

“Yeah, why not?  Can’t neglect the enjoyable things in life just because I transformed into a chick and met a billionaire.”  

You walk home with Drew and then game hard for several hours.  Demons are slaughtered and purified.  Alien blockades are destroyed with missile barrages and great gatling laser sweeps.  A great lord leads his men into battle and takes an arrow in the knee.

Drew even seems to have a bit more of his usual focus back.  He seems less distracted by your feminine charms and even manages to take the majority of contests on this particular night.

After another hour of killing monsters and collecting loot, Drew wanders off to the kitchen and you notice it is already getting dark outside.  Your character gets killed by some stupid cheap shot and so you shut the game system off with irritation.  You plop down on Drew’s couch just as Drew returns from the kitchen with two cold sodas.

“Thanks!”  The two of you eloquently tap cans before drinking.  You settle back on the couch and your eyes naturally drift to the TV. 

The current show is one of those awful dating comedy shows.  This particular one involves two couples selected by celebrity match makers that are forced to go on a blind date.

Drew notices you watching the TV and [[turns up the volume.]]

It is clear from the first second they lay eyes on each other that they hate each other.  Obligated to continue with the show, they go on an awful date, much to the delight of the viewing audience.

“You’re just a gross pig!” the woman shouts at her date.

“I just like shrimp!  You’re the one that looks like a pig!  Women are not supposed to weigh more than a hundred and seventy five pounds.  What are you, pushing right up against two hundred?” the man counters and you chuckle.

“How dare you!?” the woman shouts.  You nearly laugh your ass off as the woman douses the man in wine.  The man just stares at his date with a look of disbelief that morphs into barely concealed rage.  You suspect if there was not a camera directly in the guy’s face the woman might have left the evening with a black eye.  //Or... not.  You aren&#39;t allowed to hit girls... even if they are super mouthy.  Hmm.. maybe I stumbled onto a loophole here!  Female privilege, whoooo!//

“Hahah!  I forgot about that.  Now that I am like this I can go and like punch guys in the face and they can’t do shit to me because I am a woman… or they think I am.”

“That doesn’t seem like a good attitude to have,” Drew says with a frown.

“Hey!  I was joking.  I just mean look at that: the chick threw wine in the guy’s face.  //He// wasn’t flinging shrimp at //her.//  He is just expected to take it.  It just seems so wrong…” you comment.

“So I take it you are above two hundred?” the dripping man enquires and you howl with laughter.

The woman stands up and lunges across the table, slapping the man across his already wine soaked cheek.  “I hope you die!” are the last words the woman shrieks before she stomps off screen.

At the end of the show you laugh hard when they ask: “Would you go on a second date?” and it shows the couple’s reaction in split screen.  The woman yells “//BLEEP// No!”  While the man thoughtfully ponders the question for a long moment and then shrugs and gives a wobbly nod.

“Holy shit… that was one of the worst dates ever!” you [[remark when the credits roll.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="947" name="remark when the credits roll." tags="" position="10400,26091" size="100,100">Drew sighs loudly and hunches forward.  “I have never been on a date before,” Drew admits.  “Not even a bad one…”

Drew’s depressing tone annoys you.  “Dates are overrated!” you comment offhandedly.  “Did you not watch the show?”  Drew nods.  He then frowns and stares at the carpet, looking unbearably sad.  You even think you catch a glimmer of a tear and you look away awkwardly.  “Is that something you want to do?”

Drew recoils as if slapped.  “W-what?  W-with //you?//” he stutters.

//Wait… what?  That wasn’t a fucking offer!//  “You want to go out on a //date// with //me//?”

Drew fidgets for a moment before he straightens up.  He balls his trembling hands into fists and makes eye contact with you.  It is obvious it is taking every iota of Drew’s willpower to push on, but he does.  “Yes!  I would do //anything// for a chance.  Please, Taylor, go out on a date with me.”

Your jaw drops and your head suddenly feels like you are spinning.  You feel like someone has just sucker punched you.  “Huh?”  //What the fuck, Drew?// you silently wonder as you study your friend’s completely serious face.  //He doesn’t appear to be joking…//  “Drew… I know things have been kind of weird and tense between us.  I crossed the line a couple of times too but that was mostly my fault.  You know what I am… What I //really// am.  You still want to go on a date with me?”

Drew seems frustrated.  “You don’t seem to understand.  That is why I…  why I // like// you so much,” Drew begins to confess.  “I know who you really are, and you’re a kind, compassionate person that is funny and awesome.  You’re a joy to be around, Taylor… well, most of the time.  I don’t care if you used to be different!  What matters is now and the future!  When I look at you, I not only see the most beautiful woman in the world, but one of the one of the best people I have ever known.  You’re my best friend but I wish you were even more than that, no matter how selfish it may be.”

You feel your heart swell in your chest.  Even if Drew is being ridiculous, it feels good to be praised.  Yet, the passion in Drew’s voice shakes you to your very core.  You know he is exaggerating but [[you cannot help but be a little bit charmed.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="948" name="you cannot help but be a little bit charmed." tags="" position="10245,26143" size="100,100">“No matter what happens, I am okay with it…  I am just glad we got to spend this much time together lately,&quot; he continues.  &quot;It has been really fun.”

“It hasn’t been all bad,” you concede with a faint smile.

The floodgates are already open.  Drew keeps pouring his heart out.  “I realized something a while back and it really made me think...” 

“What’s that?”

“That you have been responsible for or present at nearly every good memory I have had in my entire life.  Without you, Taylor… my life //sucks.//  But when you are in it my life isn&#39;t just bearable, it is fun!  Even if is just one night, Taylor… Please, just go out with me once!”

Your breath catches in your throat and you sense your emotions are getting the best of you.  Your eyes feel heavy and wet.  You feel like time has suddenly slowed down to a crawl.  Your answer to Drew’s insane request is obvious… or it should be.  You open your mouth to politely let Drew down, but instead of speaking, you find yourself unable to utter a single word.  Your mind descends into a confused state, battling a horde of conflicting and largely incoherent thoughts.

“Taylor?  Are you okay?” Drew asks you.  He sounds so concerned, but his words sound somewhat distant.  You feel a bit dizzy and uncomfortably //warm//.  //What has happened to me?// you wonder as you attempt to calm your thundering heart.

You try and collect your thoughts but find that to be an impossible task.  “Drew…  I… I care for you too.  I need to think about this though…  I feel really confused…  You know how weird everything has been lately.  I am not really myself.  I need to think this over.”

“Take all the time you need, Taylor.  I will always be here.  I just want to spend as much time with you as I can… but I would never force you to do anything.  I really like you.  With Bloom on board you will be cured in no time, of that I have no doubt.  I just couldn’t squander this opportunity, no matter the outcome.  A week from now you could be back the way you were and then this moment would be gone.  I am not sure if I could live with that regret.”

“Uhh… Don’t say stuff like that!  [[I will text you on Monday.  Goodbye, Drew.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="949" name="I will text you on Monday.  Goodbye, Drew.”" tags="" position="10403,26236" size="100,100">You almost forget to morph your facial features, but remember just before you get to the street.  You turn to the side and will your face to change.  After a moment of uncomfortable reconstruction, you soon have a completely different face.  You walk home with heavy feet, encumbered by the thoughts and emotions from your visit with Drew.

You go home, grab a yogurt from the kitchen, and then lock yourself in your room.  Some of Drew’s depression and weirdness seems to have invaded your psyche.  For the remainder of the weekend, you are tormented by thoughts that no young man should ever be forced to consider.  

You sit cross legged on the floor, staring at your flat groin.  “I am not a man… but I am.  I am not.  Yes, of course I am!” you argue with yourself.  //This is how it happens!  This is the start of a multiple personality disorder, I am fucking sure of it!//

You try and desperately sort out your thoughts.  You imagine if you look at things objectively and with a degree of rationality, you will find a suitable answer.  

You reflect on how ugly men are.  //That’s right.  Big, hairy beasts.//  Even the best of them were somewhat grotesque compared to the female form you have long admired… and now possess.  

//And then there is Drew...//  Drew was far from the most attractive man in the world, but he had been occupying more and more of your thoughts lately.  //But I am not thinking about him //that// way!// you try and convince yourself.  //I am definitely not attracted to guys!// you conclude after minor deliberation.

You know there is more to attraction than purely physical appearance.  You have often seen hot babes with unattractive men.  You had just always assumed they were rich, [[well hung, or a comedian in waiting.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="950" name="well hung, or a comedian in waiting." tags="" position="10244,26292" size="100,100">//Well hung...//  “Ugh!”  You struggle against your dirty mind.  //Stupid, ugly, perverted men!  Am I still one of them?  Maybe that’s why I am so messed up!//  You shake your head.  You know there is more to many people than mere shallow classification can present..

You had only recently discovered that Drew was surprisingly brave.  You wonder what sort of other features he have hidden away.  He was obviously smart, and quick witted.  //He isn’t that bad with his hands, either...// you admit.  He is also the reason you have been able to make as much progress as you have in untangling the mystery of your condition.

You like and admire Drew and have a lot of fun when the two of you are together.  Your time with Drew is usually carefree and full of laughter.

There is nothing wrong with Drew per se.  As far as a boyfriend would go he would probably be a decent choice.  //Oh my god… I am really considering this…  Can I go on a date with a guy and keep my sense of self identity intact?//  

“Probably not… at least not entirely.  I am not gay but I do like Drew as a friend.  He is awesome and he has been great to me.  Perhaps going out on a single date with him would be an easy way to pay back the frankly enormous debt you seem to have amassed with him.  You know Drew would never ask for repayment and that sympathy only makes you want to repay him all the more.

You try and watch a movie and play some games but find them unenjoyable.  You end up tossing and turning in bed for most of the night.

The next day, a Sunday, you wake up feeling frazzled and tense.  This naturally [[leads you to a masturbation session in an effort to relieve your frustrations.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="951" name="The two of you maneuver the canoe into the water and load it up." tags="" position="2002,15801" size="100,100">Captain Evan takes charge.  “Arlight, Taylor.  Hop in first!  You’re lighter.  I will push us off.”  You sit in the front of the canoe and feel a twinge of nervousness as your weight causes the canoe to shift and tip dangerously.  You narrowly avoid falling over.  //Fuck, that would have been graceful!  I blame this oddly proportioned body!//

“Holy fuck!  This thing is tippy!” you warn Evan.  Once you are sitting comfortably, it seems like less of an issue but you become certain this trip will be physically strenuous and that a fine balance will be struck between sailing and sinking.

With a great shove, Evan pushes the canoe off.  The canoe glides out to the center of the lake.  The two of you paddle on in silence and you feel your worries gradually evaporate as you listen to the pleasant nature sounds around you.  

“//Tranquility//,” you remark, using the only word you know of that seems to fit the scene.

“What?”

“This day is just… perfect,” you elaborate.

You hear a beer can open.  “It is now!” Evan jokes.  “But, yeah, it is a beautiful day,” Evan agrees, followed by a long sip.  “It doesn’t get any better than this…” he remarks before correcting himself and shooting you a sidelong glance.  “Well…  I guess there is //one// way,” Evan says to you with a suggestive wiggle of his eyebrows.

You look back at Evan and consider pushing him overboard with your paddle.  “Are you kidding?”  You sigh as you answer your own question.  //Of course not...//

“C’mon, Taylor!  You said it yourself.  This day is perfect.  Let’s make it… uh… //more// perfect?”

[[“Evan, can we just skip the whiny speech?”]] you request.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="952" name="voice mockingly echoes over the lake." tags="" position="1801,15743" size="100,100">With a soft breeze blowing through your long brown hair, you continue to fish.

It takes about twenty casts before you get a nibble, but it doesn’t bother you because, for just a small window of time, it is just you and the lake… and the fish you desire to catch.

After about twenty minutes, you manage to catch a trout.  You throw him in a nearby bucket.  Almost immediately you get another bite.

“Holy shit, I caught another one!” you cheer as a second fish drops into your bucket.  //I am a master fisherman… woman… fuck...//  You shake your head and try and focus solely on the task at hand.  You whip your arm back and wind up for a great cast.  You let loose with all your might and the lure sails through the air, breaking the water’s pristine surface about twenty yards away with a soft //plunk.//

You reel in slowly, making soft jerking motions to direct the lure.  //Yeah… make it look alive and delicious…  Fucking stupid fish...//

You see a dark shape ascend a second before it breaks the water.  You have a moment of mad excitement as the fish bites down hard and you set the hook right before the line begins to scream as the fish takes off.  

“Holy shit this is going to be a huge one!”  You let him have some line before you turn up the rod’s drag.  You begin to reel in slowly but the fish begins to resist, diving deeper into the pale green water.

“Jesus!  Evan this thing is a monster!” [[you warn your friend.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="953" name="you warn your friend." tags="" position="1649,15847" size="100,100">Evan gives you a bored look while he calmly sips his beer.

The fish breaks the water with a splash and then dives again, stealing back much of the line you just reeled in.  

“You stubborn fucker!  I am not going to lose to you!” you declare just as your rod’s tip bends dangerously downward.  For a second, you fear your rod will snap.  “Shit!  Shitshitshit!  I won’t let you get away!”  Your slender arms shake under the stress, but you pull the rod forward and then rapidly reel in the slack you create.

You grit your teeth and stubbornly continue your actions.  Each time the fish gets close to the dock, it seems to get a fresh wind and dives back into the weeds.

“Here it comes Evan!  Get the fucking camera or a net or some shit!  I am not losing this whale!” you shout as you finally manage to flng the fish onto the dock.

It flips all over the place in desperation.  You cannot help but stare at its silvery body in shock.  The fish is //tiny.//  It is almost more minnow than adult.

Evan laughs uproariously when he sees the catch you struggled with for so long.  “Hahaha, what the hell is that?  It is a seamonster!  Just throw it back, that isn’t even enough for a single fish-stick.”

“No way!  I caught this!  And besides, I read this thing on the internet that said that most of these die if you throw them back.  So I am going to do the environmentally responsible thing and keep it!”

“Oh, well since you read it on the internet it has got to be true!”

“I know, right?”  [[You toss the tiny fish in your fish bucket and cast out again.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="954" name="You toss the tiny fish in your fish bucket and cast out again." tags="" position="1802,15895" size="100,100">You drink a couple beers and bullshit the afternoon away as you fill your bucket with an impressive catch.

Evan seems somewhat bored but content to watch you cast.  You suspect he spends most of the morning and afternoon staring at your ass.

After much teasing, you convince Evan to fish with you for a bit.  The two of you stand side by side as you each fish your own little zones.

“Double header!” you shout with joy as both of your lines start screaming at the same time.

After an intense battle, you claim two more trout.  You generously help Evan take his fish off the line.

“Are you going to… you know… //butcher// these things?” Evan asks you, while eyeing the nearly full bucket with distaste.

“I could //fillet// them,” you correct Evan.  “But since they are mostly trout I will just gut them and do the “skin on trick” my uncle showed me years ago.  Super tasty and less hassle,” you conclude.

[[“Oh.  Very impressive.”]]

You nearly have a heart attack but you decide Julie’s expression does not represent one of anger.  //If she knew about Ryan and I she wouldn’t be asking to talk...//

You feel weighed down by guilt.  “Sure…” You follow your sister into her room.

Julie looks straight at you.  You feel like you are watching an intervention.  You have a really bad feeling about this…

“Ryan has been kind of weird lately,” Julie begins.  “I noticed an equally weird vibe between the two of you…” she notes, her dark eyes narrowing suspiciously.  “Taylor, please tell me the truth: is something going on between the two of you?”

Julie’s blunt question is like a slap in the face.  //The truth?  How can I explain to Julie when I don’t even understand why the hell I have made these choices!//

In this tense moment you feel like an absolute piece of shit.  Julie has always been fairly supportive of you and the two of you have shared a close bond since you were children.  //And now I am helping her boyfriend cheat on her...//

[[Try and tell Julie the truth about your relationship with Ryan.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="956" name="Try and tell Julie the truth about your relationship with Ryan." tags="" position="12131,24207" size="100,100">You decide that your horrible secret has tortured you long enough.  //I have to come clean… Even if Julie kills me...//

It takes all your willpower to speak but you eventually manage.  “Julie, I am so sorry...the truth is...I am fucked in the head…”

“Uh huh…”  Julie nods, clearly waiting for you to continue, as if your admission was obvious.

“The truth is...I kind of… like Ryan,” you finish, your voice barely above a whisper.  Saying the words aloud makes them feel even more real.  Your time spent with Ryan almost seems like some dream or fantasy… but your relationship has moved far beyond that into reality.

Julie seems stunned at your words.  “What!?  //You// like //Ryan?//” your sister repeats your statement with an element of disbelief.

You brace yourself for a slap you are sure is about to come yet doesn’t.  //I hope she makes it quick.  Fuck!  I should have purged the room of anything that could be used as a weapon before I confessed!//  Instead of bludgeoning you with a lamp, Julie just stares at you in silence.  After about a minute, Julie looks like she is about to laugh but her expression returns to neutral as you sheepishly return her gaze.  Julie now looks confused...and above all //concerned//.

“Holy shit, Taylor… //you are actually serious//….  My little brother, heh, //sister,// has the hots for my boyfriend,” Julie repeats, [[her lips morphing into a wicked smile.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="957" name="Brush off her concerns." tags="" position="12643,24192" size="100,100">“Naahh!  There is nothing going on, Julie.  I have just been a little, you know, //mixed up// recently.  I will be fine, you don’t have to worry about me!”

Julie frowns.  “It wasn’t you I was really worried about…  Ryan can be a bit //overzealous// sometimes especially if he finds a girl that he likes.  You look a lot like me and he thinks I am a total babe, so it is only natural that I am a bit wary, right?”

“Sure, I guess…” you respond. You can’t quite bring yourself to praise Ryan’s self control.

“Anyway, if Ryan pulls anything just kick him in the balls and let me know and I will… //punish him,// hehe!”

Julie’s threat reminds you of why it would be impossible to come clean about how far your relationship with Ryan has progressed.  //She will definitely kill me...//

You give Julie what you hope comes off as a reassuring smile and depart from her room.  Once in the hall you slump over.  You can’t imagine giving up Ryan… or Julie.  Your relationship with Ryan will just have to stay a secret.

“A sexy… //forbidden// secret…  Ahhhgh….”  Just the mere idea seems to set your passions aflame.  [[“I just hope we don’t get caught…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="958" name="her lips morphing into a wicked smile." tags="" position="11993,24257" size="100,100">You feel your face flush with embarrassment.  “Believe me, I wish that I wasn’t attracted to him… I am sorry, Julie...It is this body I think.  I just can’t….”

“Can’t stop thinking about Ryan?  Well I don’t blame you.  He is fucking gorgeous and you are a Roux, so you’re fucking horny by default, and then with your, uh… “circumstances…” that has to really mix you up too.  You’re a perv who has transformed into a babe.  That has got to make you crazy!”

Julie’s reaction is off putting.  “So...you’re not mad?”

“Mad that you think my boyfriend is hot?  Nah!  It isn’t like he cheated on me or anything.  I am glad you told me though, I appreciate your honesty.  I guess I probably should have got you a vibrator or something.”

“Er...I don’t think a vibrator is going to help me…” you predict.

“You know what?  You’re right!”  Julie’s eyes suddenly go wide.  She bites her lip and her eyes roam the room, seemingly unable to focus on you.  “How about… you try out the real thing then?” Julie suggests.

Your blood runs cold.  “//Ww-whaaat?//”

“Maybe I will ask Ryan if he is interested in a little...um… //exploratory threesome?//  He is so good in bed he won’t let either of us down.  Would you like that, Taylor?”

Julie’s bizzare offer leaves you stunned.  Julie has always been a bit on the promiscuous side but this seems totally out of line, [[even for her.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="959" name="“I just hope we don’t get caught…”" tags="" position="12497,24250" size="100,100">The next day in class Evan notes how distracted you are.  “Taylor, what’s up with you?  You have been way more of a space cadet than usual.  How is unravelling the ultimate genderbender conspiracy going?”

“Huh?  Oh… I have just been kind of busy lately!”

“Hey, I don’t blame you.  If I were you I would totally just stay like that.  No offense, but you are //way// better looking as a chick.”

“Gee, thanks Evan.  That is incredibly helpful,” you reply sarcastically.

“Well, what’s got you all flustered?”

“I uhh…”  //Jesus… I cannot talk to Evan about this shit!//  “It’s nothing.  Just this body is affecting my mind and Julie and her boyfriend keep… uh… intruding on my life.”

You talk with Evan and Drew for a few minutes and then go on to another uneventful class.

On the walk home Ryan sends you a text.

“Want to hangout? :)” 

You type out [[“Yes!”]] and hit send before you even realize what you are doing.  //Fuck, I REALLY need to work on my impulse control!//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="960" name="“Yes!”" tags="" position="12639,24344" size="100,100">When you arrive home you notice a familiar car parked out front.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/car.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You feel giddy as you almost skip up your front steps.

“Taylor!” Ryan greets you from behind as he exits his vehicle.  You spin on your heel and wave at Ryan.  

“I didn’t see you there!” 

Ryan rushes up to you.  You can smell his spicy cologne.  “May I come in?” he asks you with his usual perfect smile.

[[“I guess so.”]]

//How the hell did it all lead to this?// you wonder as you make the familiar humiliating trek to Mitch’s apartment.

You let yourself in. Mitch is waiting for you in the living room. 

“Taylor!  That was quick!  You must be almost as horny as I am.”

“What do you want?” 

“The same thing I always want.  I want to see you on your fuckin’ knees slobbering on my cock.”  Mitch opens his fly, letting his huge penis flop out.  His dick is almost bigger than your fucking head.

“You want a little pick-me-up first or is my dick in your mouth all you need?” Mitch teases you.  He points to an end table with a line of cocaine on it.

//Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!//  Just //looking// at the shit, you can feel your self control beginning to erode.  //I have to get control over myself and these cravings...//  Yet, is such a thing even possible anymore?  With the huge line of powder beckoning you forth, you decide to:
[[Do the drugs]]
[[Try to resist the temptation]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="962" name="Do the drugs" tags="" position="13699,24143" size="100,100">A part of you is mortified at how routine this whole quasi transaction has become.  You are glad those nagging internal voices that once plagued your mind have now been silenced by a wave of tingling bliss.  You feel //awesome// right now… Everything around you is suddenly interesting, vivid and sharp.  Even Mitch’s dick doesn’t seem //quite// so offensive when you are high out of your fucking mind.

Mitch roughly grabs your hair as he begins to jerk off towards your face.  His actions spur your own and soon you are gagging on Mitch’s dick and conducting a now familiar ritual.  You suck his cock and act like you like it.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/mitchfacial.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Once Mitch unloads on your face, you obediently take his softening cock in your mouth and slowly suck the last of the semen from his shaft.

You go to wash your face and rinse your mouth out and, when you return, Mitch is lying down on the couch.  You are about to ask permission to leave when Mitch makes you an offer.

[[“Do you want to try shooting some coke?”]] Mitch offers.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="963" name="Try to resist the temptation" tags="" position="13399,24045" size="100,100">Resistance is futile!

You can //shoot// cocaine? I have never heard of that before.”

“Well most people don’t because they are pussies,” Mitch explains.  “But it is fuckin’ awesome… it’s the best feeling for sure. I don’t like putting stuff up my nose or coughing my ass off, so this is way better. Trust me. I guarantee if you try this, you will feel better than you ever have in your entire life.”

You wince. That claim certainly has a strong appeal.

Mitch takes your silence as assent. He begins to prepare the coke for injection. You can’t quite see what Mitch is doing. He seems to dissolve the cocaine in what appears to be a small vial of water. He then fills a syringe and sets it down on the table.

You once swore you would never try heroin. //Well, technically I am keeping that promise. This is only cocaine!// you rationalize.  //Drugs are bad!  Mmmmk!// But then again, so are you. You and drugs just suit each other. Your life is pretty fucked up and drugs certainly seem to help distract you from your frustrations… even if they clearly worsen them in the long term. You are already buzzed but you can feel the euphoria fading rapidly. If you would have been completely sober you know that you would have refused any possibility of using a needle… especially one offered by Mitch.  //Putting something in my veins?  No way… Wait a sec… I guess everything ends up in my bloodstream anyway…  Does it really matter?  NO!  Of course it matters!//  Your internal argument [[gradually saps your strength away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="965" name="gradually saps your strength away." tags="" position="13699,24299" size="100,100">You eye the syringe. The liquid inside has an off putting yellow color.  You feel sick to you stomach when you look at it.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/syringe.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
//Fuck!  I cannot be considering this!//  Your mind unleashes a cascade of warning sirens but you still pick up the object out of a vague yearning and sense of curiosity.

“Here, I will help you,” Mitch offers.  He sits beside you on the couch.

“No, it is okay… I would rather not…” you refuse but Mitch just moves closer.  He gently strokes your arm, taking your hand in his.  He then begins to feel for a vein in the soft crook of your arm.  “Mitch, please… I…”

“It’s okay, Taylor.  Don’t worry.  You have already tried coke, you’re still probably a bit high right now.  This is practically the same thing,” Mitch argues.  “It is like the difference between a cigarette and a cigar.  This is good shit too.  It would cost a fortune and here I am offering it to you for free like an old friend.  You don’t need to thank me until later.”

You meet Mitch’s unsympathetic eyes and shiver.  You feel vulnerable and frightened while a small fragment of your psyche whispers that the only way to demolish those feelings is with that awful little syringe.

Mitch takes the needle from your trembling hand and repositions it near your arm.  You shake your head “no” but Mitch just says, “Don’t worry, Taylor!  This is a //good// needle.  It will make you feel better, [[it is just like medicine,”]] Mitch assures you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="966" name="it is just like medicine,”" tags="" position="13543,24353" size="100,100">
Mitch sticks the needle in your arm.  Before you can push him away, he presses down the plunger and all hope of resistance is immediately washed away.

It is instantly clear that injecting drugs directly into your veins is exactly as Mitch had described.  A wave of euphoria so intense it physically knocks you over as it sweeps through your nervous system.  You stare up at the ceiling as you feel feel a slow, creeping chill descend down your spine.  Everything else in the world fades away… and then rapidly comes back into focus.

You can faintly taste and smell the coke, even though it is in your bloodstream.  The next thing you know, you feel an unimaginable rush of pleasure is like a hundred thousand orgasms morphed into one. 

You feel every pleasure center in your brain, every neuron, fire and surge.  Your brain melts with delightful warmth as the whole world becomes alive.  Your worries and inhibitions disappear completely, as if they never existed at all in the first place.  You feel like you are ascending to heaven.  //Mitch was right… this is… marvelous!//

“Wow your pupils are huge!” Mitch comments. [[“You look so fucking high, haha…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="967" name="you can feel your love juice dripping down your thigh." tags="" position="13543,24505" size="100,100">You mount Mitch and guide his huge cock into your aching center.  You let gravity to do its work and slowly slide down until you have taken as much of Mitch inside you as possible.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchdeep.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You begin to ride Mitch.  You accept his cock and let your clit touch Mitch’s pubes before rising up until he is just about to pop out of you.  Then you fall back and let Mitch penetrate you to your utmost limits.

You revel in the glow of your dual injections.  //Coke and cock...ahh...//  You lose yourself in the moment and your rough sex with Mitch.

You mindlessly hump away, it is hard to think of anything else except how good you it feels to have such a huge cock thrusting inside you.

Mitch finally reaches his limit and grabs your hips, pushing down as he thrusts balls deep inside you and ejaculates.  You feel your rival’s cock spasm as he seeds you, filling your uterus with his cum.

Mitch falls backwards on the bed with his penis still embedded inside you.  You look down at Mitch’s sweaty, satisfied face.

To your slight disappointment, Mitch’s penis deflates inside you… until the moment you make eye contact.

The two of you stare at each other for a long, distressing moment.  You can feel Mitch’s manhood responding, reversing course so that it is now rapidly stiffening inside you.  A few seconds later, Mitch is swollen to capacity and you resume your almost animalistic sex.

After about half an hour of vicious fucking, your bliss gradually fades to but a shadow of its former glory.  You desperately want to rekindle your pleasurable bonfire.  You want to just leave and flee out into the night and never look back.  Instead, you ask Mitch, “Do you have any more?”

Mitch doesn’t need further elaboration.  [[“Taylor, I will always have something for you,”]] he replies with a grin.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="968" name="“Taylor, I will always have something for you,”" tags="" position="13699,24599" size="100,100">The next day you feel //shitty.//  You are ashamed and sore, but beyond that, your head feels like it has been set in a laundry spin cycle.  Your whole world now seems whitewashed and unbearably drab.  To make matters worse, you wake up in //Mitch’s bed.//

“Fuck my life….”  You pry Mitch’s arm off you and shamble to the hallway, picking up your still damp panties and errant articles of clothing on your way out.

You dash to the bathroom and dress quickly.  You look at your reflection in the mirror with a frown.  Your hair is messy and frazzled, but beyond that, you look incredibly tired, with large purple bags under your eyes.  Above all, you look stressed out.  Your face seems slimmer as well as if you have recently lost some weight.  You shiver as you recall how you burned off a lot of those calories.

You sneak out of Mitch’s place and walk home in a daze.

When you arrive, you feel hungry but don’t really have a desire to eat.  After lying on the couch for a while you finally drag yourself to the kitchen.  You begin to prepare your favorite desert...you throw a banana on top and smother it with chocolate syrup.

You take a huge, glorious bite… only to nearly retch.  

“Uck!  Pfhhh!  God damnit!”  //It tastes like shit…?//  “What the hell?”

You sample the vanilla, fudge, and banana independently.  They don’t taste like they are spoiled…  //It isn’t the ingredients,// you realize.  //It’s me.//

“Damn… what the hell have I done to myself?”  As much as you would like to blame Mitch, you can’t.  At least not completely.  “I can’t believe I ruined fucking icecream for myself.  [[Surely this has to be rock bottom!”]]

You groan.  //I am losing my fucking mind!  I need like an exorcist… or maybe some more drugs?  No!  Bad Taylor!//

“Do you know what would make you feel better?” DT questions you.  She doesn’t even give you a second to respond before she answers her own question.  “COCAINE!”

“Uhhhnn... how about, “no!”  Leave me the hell alone, you little devil!”

Devil Taylor giggles.  “Hah.  Even if that was the best icecream of your life it would still be like eating garbage in comparison to the powder infused euphoria you felt last night.  Wasn’t that just //delightfully unforgettable//?  When are we doing it again?”

“Fucking never!” you shout.  “And why the hell are you naked?”

DT grins.  “Because I am a //sexy// devil of course.  Your psyche made me, so maybe it is just because you’re a fucking pervert.”

“You little fucking pipsqueak!”  //Now all I can think about is fucking cocaine!//  “I hate you!”

“You okay, Taylor?” Julie’s voice suddenly reaches you and you snap to attention.  “Who are you talking to?” your sister wonders as she shoots a suspicious sweeping glance around the room as if to seek out intruders or hidden lovers.

“No one!”  //Just the little devil living inside me...//  “I am not going crazy!”

“Huh?  I didn’t say that you were… Taylor...are you--?”

“It’s okay!  Just leave me alone!”

“Wow, Taylor… maybe you are really losing it,” Julie comments with a worried look.  &quot;You don&#39;t look so hot either...&quot;

He fumbles with his fly for a moment before he withdraws his painfully erect penis and points it right at you.

The sight of your friend’s bare weiner seems to clash with the rest of the idyllic scene.

“Evan, what the fuck is wrong with you?”

Evan laughs.  “//Sooo// many things.  But chief among my difficulties right now is this…” Evan says as he gestures at his crotch.  He then begins to masturbate with you as the object of his focus.  

“Evan!  Seriously!  Show some fucking self control!”  Your words do nothing to dissuade Evan.  He continues stroking himself.  “You better not tip over the boat,” you warn.

“I won’t!   That’s why you can just stay there… unless you want to come back here,” he hurriedly adds.  “Or we could always go to the shore.  Feel free to show me some boobs or ass… that would definitely help.”

“No, Evan!  Sit down!  You are going to fucking tip over the goddamned booohhhhh---AHHHHHHHHH!!!”

//SPLASH!//

You see Evan topple overboard head first and then you are suddenly engulfed by cold water.  You panic and flail your limbs wildly, popping to the surface with a gasp a few seconds later.  You are glad you are wearing a life jacket.  //But Evan isn’t!  Fuck!//

“EVAN!!”  You scan the water and see no sign of your friend.  “Evan!” you scream as you swim over to the now upside down canoe.

You duck your head underwater and open your eyes but the lake, despite its outwardly clear appearance, has shockingly low visibility.  You can’t see more than a few feet in any direction and Evan is nowhere to be found.  [[You feel your heart being gripped by a vice of panic.]]

You decide to oblige Evan and show a little skin.  You lean forward and pull down your pants slightly, mooning Evan. 

As guys, he would have laughed, but now there is a palpable sexual tension descending upon the lake.  Evan begins to masturbate furiously at the sight of your exposed backside.

“I am cumming!” Evan announces after about twenty seconds.  You look back and watch in disbelief as Evan jerks off over the side of the boat.  He shoots off several voluminous spurts of ejaculate into the lake.  It floats and makes a disgusting, cloudy puddle on the surface of the water.  “Fish food!” Evan remarks after he regains his breath.

“Gross.  Evan, you need serious help.  You’re pathetic, man.  That was just fuckin’ //sad//.”

Evan nearly upends the canoe as he shifts positions.

“I know.  I am sorry, Taylor…” Evan apologizes.  His voice sounds forlorn and a lot closer than you expect.  “After I cum, sometimes I feel like a piece of shit…  I just get so… //pent up// around you it is hard to bear,” he lamely explains.  

“Are you blaming me?  Well maybe we shouldn’t spend so much time together,” you suggest.  “This cabin trip with the two of us was a bad idea.”

“No!  Being apart would be way worse.  And this cabin trip was a great idea!---The //best// idea!” Evan asserts.  Your friend then goes silent for a long time.  “I love spending time with you,” Evan whispers [[but you hear his words clearly.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="974" name="Offer Evan a hand" tags="" position="2353,16146" size="100,100">You decide to offer Evan a hand.

You slowly reorient yourself until you are facing Evan.  He stops stroking himself but resumes once he sees your shy smile.

Keeping your center of gravity low, you slowly slink towards Evan.  The canoe subtly begins to tilt towards the rear as you wiggle forward.

Knowing that you could tip over at any moment… or be seen by a potential observer from the shore adds an element of dangerous exhibitionism.

Soon you are about two feet from Evan’s exposed erection.  

“What are you doing?” Evan asks you.

“Hmm…  I haven’t decided yet.”  You poke Evan’s cock with your index finger.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/helpevan.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You slowly wrap your hands around Evan’s dick and begin to gently massage him.  You stroke away at Evan while tonguing his glans and precum winking slit.  Evan lasts only a few moments before he orgasms all over your waiting tongue.

You let the fishy cream drip onto the boat’s bottom.

Now that Evan has cum you feel vaguely left out.  You feel uncomfortably warm and your damp underwear is sticking your groin.

[[“Let’s go back to the cabin,”|Then so be it.]] you suggest.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="975" name="Mwahah-ha-ha!”" tags="" position="2401,15800" size="100,100">You apparently used your time in Scouts to great effect, for you have the lure tied off and gracefully sailing through the air in a perfect cast within thirty seconds.  //Dad would be proud!//

A moment later, Evan returns with a giant bag of chips, a cooler full of beer, and a large beach towel which he sets down over the rough dock boards.

Evan tosses you a beer and you gratefully accept.  Beer in one hand, rod in the other, you enjoy the relaxing combination as the two of you look out over the shockingly calm water.  For a moment, you feel like you are ten years old again.  

After what seems like ages, you finally get a bite.  You reel it in with  childish glee.

“Holy shit!  I //actually caught a fucking fish!//  Heck yeah!  I am the greatest,” you comment in amazement as the feisty trout hits the dock with a series of acrobatic flips.  You quickly snatch it up and shoot Evan a proud, lopsided grin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/trout.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Why are you so surprised?  This lake is filled with those slimy things.  It would be weird if you //didn’t// catch one!” Evan mutters.

You scowl at Evan as he undermines your immense achievement.  You call Evan a dick and resume fishing.

A few hours later, you throw another empty beer can into a pile that now curiously resembles a pyramid.  Evan immediately tosses you another beer.

“You trying to get me drunk?” you accuse Evan.

“Hey!  We are on //vacation!//” Evan rationalizes.

“You’re right…” At that moment, you find yourself feeling a bit fatigued.  [[You lie down beside Evan on the towel.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="976" name="You lie down beside Evan on the towel." tags="" position="2253,15845" size="100,100">
The hot sun pulses down from above, warming your already flushed skin with its intense rays.

Evan props himself up on one elbow.  “You know, there is no one around…” 

You roll your eyes.  “Yeah, that’s the point of a cabin in the woods…” you respond to Evan’s suggestion.

“I mean, uh… you might as well work on your tan, right?”  Evan takes off his own shirt as if to prove the act harmless.

“Ohhh… I see where this going!”  You stare at Evan and he has the grace to look somewhat ashamed.  “Not a bad idea!” you finally decide, much to Evan’s surprise.  You pull your T-shirt over your head and unclip your bra and go topless, lying back down beside your friend.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytopless.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You can feel Evan’s eyes on you, as [[palpable as the sun’s light.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="977" name="palpable as the sun’s light." tags="" position="2401,15942" size="100,100">You close your eyes for a moment and when you open them again you can’t help but notice Evan staring at you, or more specifically, your breasts.

You try and ignore him and nap.

You wake up with Evan snuggling up next to you.  You almost //accidently// push him off the dock.  You thumb Evan in the ribs and he wakes up.  

With the wanning light, the two of you begin to clean up.  Evan retreats to the shed to put away the fishing gear.

When Evan returns, you are waiting for him outside of the cabin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayoutside.jpg&quot; width=&quot;682px&quot; height=&quot;1024px&quot;&gt;
Evan returns from the shed and stops dead in his tracks when he sees you.  He drops the small hatchet from his hand.  “T-taylor!  Holy fuck!”

“You already had an orgasm but what about me?” you complain.

Evan sweeps you up and the next thing you know you are making out with Evan in the living room.

[[“I will return the favor!” Evan promises.|Then so be it.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="978" name="something a little bigger inside you." tags="" position="664,9044" size="100,100">You wander to the bathroom and wonder what you have that you could use to satisfy your urge.  Your eyes fall on a hairbrush.  You wash the handle with hot, soapy water and create a make-shift dildo.

“Holy fuck...this feels amazing!”  You moan as you guide the handle between your tender folds.

You cum hard, your legs quivering, sending shocks down to your very toes.

Despite your best efforts, you can’t //quite// seem to scratch your proverbial itch.  “I bet Julie has something…”  //But even if she does… do I really want to experiment with something already used?//  You would never ask to borrow Julie’s toothbrush, let alone something so disgustingly intimate.

You creep to Julie’s underwear drawer.  You feel a bit guilty for invading Julie’s privacy but your curiosity is too great to ignore.  Under a pile of panties and bras, you find what you are looking for.

You hold the hard plastic object in your hands.  With your small, slender fingers, the phallic object looks unnaturally large.

“Ugh… am I really going to put this inside me?”  The object looks far too much like a penis for you to hold it without an odd, nervous feeling that you find difficult to place.

You go to the bathroom and scald the dildo with hot, soapy water until you are certain it is clean.  You stroke your hot pussy and your hand comes back wet.

Using Julie’s vibrator is gross enough but you are family.  You certainly wouldn’t borrow Julie’s toothbrush but you //really// need this.  “Ugh… Okay… I will just try a bit… [[just the tip…” you decide.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="979" name="just the tip…” you decide." tags="" position="516,9130" size="100,100">You place the dildo on the bathroom floor and then mount it, placing the opening of your slick, burning pussy against the plastic.  You let the cool plastic glans tease your labia until it is warm and coated with your own juices.  The dildo is clearly a bit too big your tiny opening.  Regardless, it feels good to tease your new genitals with something hard and unyielding.

“Ohhh…”  //This feels too good...//  You are still unsatisfied.  You cannot help but wonder what it would feel like to have this thing inside you. //But that would be...// You don’t even know how to describe it. Is it really gay if you explore your own pussy?  //No, only if I imagine this is a … errrrr….//  You bite your lip and try to merely focus on the pleasurable sensation in your tingling vagina.  “God help me…  I will just try it once,” you decide.  You begin to lower yourself onto the dildo, the plastic penis spreading your most intimate insides apart.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taydildo.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uhhh… ohh… OW!  Shit…”  //This feels so weird...//  Being penetrated hurts but also fulfills a deep seated urge.  You impale yourself on the dildo, sliding down until the void inside you is filled.

“Uhhnggfg…”  It takes you a couple of minutes to grow accustomed to the feeling of being stretched.  You notice a small trickle of blood amongst the fluids coating the glistening dildo.

You have already come this far.  You want to experience more of this new sensation.  You slowly begin to move.  The tight fit and unfamiliarity of your actions forces you to be careful.

You masturbate with the dildo for a long time.  Eventually, you find yourself wet enough to insert the dildo with minimal effort.  When you feel your orgasm approach, you put the dildo on the floor and then follow your instincts, humping the plastic cock until you are launched into a shuddering orgasm.

After you are finished, you lie on the tile floor sweating [[in a pool of your own juices.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="980" name="“I guess so.”" tags="" position="12495,24390" size="100,100">The two of you enter your house hand in hand.  Once inside, Ryan moves in for a kiss but you push him back, although it takes every last iota of your self control to do so.  

“Hold your horses!”  You walk into the kitchen and grab two flavored beers.

You sit down on the couch in your living room and beckon Ryan forward.  He joins you, sitting so close to you that you can immediately feel the warmth of his leg next to your own.

You hand Ryan a beer and he accepts.  “Let’s watch a movie!” you decide.

Ryan sighs.  He was clearly hoping for a different suggestion.

You put on a random movie with a flashy title page.

The intro opens with a cowboys riding against a smouldering sunset.  Ryan ignores the show and attempts to make small talk.

“How was class?” he asks you.

“Oh… it was fine,” you reply.

“Why are you blushing?”

“I was a bit //distracted//…” you admit.

Ryan chuckles.  [[“Me too.  I can’t stop thinking about you.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="981" name="“Me too.  I can’t stop thinking about you.”" tags="" position="12640,24494" size="100,100">Your heart pounds in your chest as Ryan leans forward and kisses you, gently pressing his lips against your own until any hope of watching the movie disappears.  It plays on in the background as Ryan attempts to kiss every inch of your sensitive pale skin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryankiss.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Time seems to slip away.  You push Ryan off of you with a grunt when you notice the movie’s credits playing on the TV.  //Fuck… We were really going at it...//  As you look at Ryan, you find it difficult to breathe.  You have sweat pooled in the small of your back.  You are hot and bothered.  The room feels stuffy and claustrophobic.

Ryan returns your gaze evenly, smiling impassively back at you.

“Julie will be home soon,” Ryan warns.  In his words, you read his badly hidden request.  You glance at the tent in Ryan’s jeans and giggle.  It seems like both of you are in a similar state of arousal.

“Oh I see…  Do you want to go upstairs for a bit?” you ask Ryan with a teasing smile.

He nods eagerly.  You dash upstairs with Ryan hot on your heels.

Once inside your bedroom, [[you push Ryan down onto your bed.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="982" name="you push Ryan down onto your bed." tags="" position="12491,24538" size="100,100">You step back and pose for him.

“Take it off, baby!  Whoo!” Ryan cheers as each subsequent article of clothing hits the ground.  Soon you are naked before Ryan’s enthralling gaze.

He beckons for you to join him on the bed and you do so, but stay frustratingly out of his reach.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayopen2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;768px&quot; height=&quot;1152px&quot;&gt;
You open your legs for Ryan and show off your tiny little pussy.  He stares at you for at least thirty seconds, just breathing heavily while appreciating your beauty.

Ryan sits up and leans towards you but you push him firmly back down and crawl on top of him.  Ryan looks surprised at first but quickly submits to your control.

Your hands are drawn to Ryan’s belt like iron filings to a magnet.  As you fumble with Ryan’s pants, you silently wish Ryan would help you but he seems to enjoy watching you struggle to [[access his underwear and that which it conceals.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="983" name="access his underwear and that which it conceals." tags="" position="12639,24648" size="100,100">It seems your little show had produced its intended effect, for Ryan’s huge cock has swollen to capacity.  You undo Ryan’s belt first and then pull off his pants.  After throwing them to the ground, you move on to your prize.  You hook your fingers around the elastic bands of Ryan’s boxers and you pull them off.  Ryan’s fully erect cock bounces free right in front of your eyes.

You can’t help but marvel at this gorgeous specimen of manhood.  You feel your cheeks flush.  You know you shouldn’t be turned on, but you are more than that.  You are absolutely //dripping// with anticipation.

You don’t waste anymore time.  You kiss Ryan’s cockhead repeatedly and rub your tongue on his salty cock slit.  You glance up at Ryan’s ecstatic face and resolve to do everything you can to please Ryan.

You give him a few soft pumps with your right hand and then proceed to cup his balls as your tongue runs delicate little circles around Ryan’s glans.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocklicklick.gif&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Holy fuck…” Ryan gasps and his words just drive you to work that much harder.  You jerk, rub, kiss, lick, coax, and suck Ryan for at least fifteen minutes.  You establish a passable routine and rhythm and refine your motions based on Ryan’s moans and reactions.  Whenever your tongue hits a particularly sensitive spot, Ryan’s tight butt clenches and his penis gets thrust forward.  It is obvious that Ryan is in heaven.  Your mouth has become filled with saliva and Ryan’s precum.  It [[doesn’t take a genius to guess what will happen next.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="984" name="doesn’t take a genius to guess what will happen next." tags="" position="12497,24693" size="100,100">“I-I can’t take it!  Ohh Taylor!  Fuuckk ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh aggggghghgh…..” Ryan howls like a dying beast as he starts to cum all over you.  As soon as he begins to ejaculate, just when Ryan is at his sensitive height, you dive forward and take command.  You cover his pulsing cock with your lips and swirling tongue.  You jerk and suck the huge cock in front of you like a mad woman, eagerly accepting Ryan’s semen while trying to waste as little as possible.  Ryan’s cum tastes bitter and very unpleasant but, for his benefit, you pretend like it is fucking ambrosia.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/ryancocklove2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Ryan’s eyes roll back in his head as he drains his balls in your wet, willing mouth.  In this hazy, awesome moment, all you want is for Ryan to feel good and enjoy this sexy feeling of absolute desire and dominance for as long as possible.  With an impish smile, you greedily slurp down Ryan’s cum and kiss and lick his penis until it is shiny and clean.

“Taylor… Oh… my…. god…  I fucking love you,” Ryan says to you as he stares down at you adoringly.

//Ugh…  Please don’t say that right now!//  Your heart simultaneously soars and crashes at the same instant, nearly causing an implosion in your chest and brain at the same time.  You fear your entire psyche will be forever crushed unless you immediately take control of your feelings.

You aren’t just teasing Ryan anymore.  You are having real sexual intercourse as a woman.  You are sucking dicks and swallowing… //sperm//.  And worst of all, you are doing it willingly and enjoying every moment of it.  //Is it just because of Ryan and his weird, unescapable magnetism?  Or is it this new body?  What the hell has happened to me?//  You decide that the only thing to do is always the one that //feels// the most right.

“Ryan, I…”

[[“I have feelings for you too.”]]
[[Stay silent.  (Things are fucking complicated!)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="985" name="“I have feelings for you too.”" tags="" position="12639,24844" size="100,100">Ryan smirks as he hears your confession.  “Just //feelings?//”

You wipe some semen from the edge of your lips.  “Um...Strong feelings?”

Ryan chuckles at your response and after a moment you find yourself laughing along with him.

Ryan effortlessly pulls you up and deftly avoids your lips, giving you a kiss on your cheek.

“Let’s have a shower together,” Ryan suggests.

“What about Julie?” you whisper.  “She will be back any second.  As much as I like you Ryan, I don’t want to die for you.”

“Well we will just have to be quick then.”

You groan but let Ryan lead you to the bathroom.  Soon the warm water and Ryan’s caresses make you forget about anything else.  You linger in the shower until you suddenly become fixated on the late hour.

“Where are you going?” Ryan asks you as you grab a towel and run into your room.

“I don’t want to be seen with wet hair next to you.  Julie isn’t an idiot.  Maybe you should just go…”

“Aw, but I want to stay…”

“And I want you to stay too, just not like this…”

“I understand, Taylor.  Thank you for the lovely afternoon.”

“Get out of here!” you shoo him away.

Ryan blows you a kiss as he departs.

“Yeah, this is pretty good,” Evan admits after the first bite.  You excuse yourself for a moment to use the washroom.  When you return, Evan has already devoured the entire trout.

“You pig!”

“You have a bucket full!  I thought the point was to feast.  Cook up some more!”

Left with no other choice, you do just that.  You fry up a big pile of cajun fish sticks, using an old spice you find in the back of the cabin’s cupboards.

After dinner… things get fishy.

“You were kind of being a sour puss today,” you tease Evan.

“I just wanted to spend time with you.  And then you kind of went off in your own little world,” Evan grumbles.

“Ohhh!  Is little Evan a bit jealous?  //Of the fish?//  [[Ha-ha!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="988" name="Ha-ha!”" tags="" position="1800,16049" size="100,100">“Oh.  I am sorry if you are frustrated.  You have been well behaved today though.  I guess I can give you a little treat.”

“I am not a dog!” Evan objects… and then immediately caves.  “But I do want a little treat,” he adds in a small voice.

You laugh at Evan.  He follows you into the living room and sets down on the old couch.  Much to Evan’s surprise and delight, you kneel down between his legs and gently paw at Evan’s groin.  You can feel his rock hard penis outlined in the fabric.

You pull out Evan&#39;s dick and smother Evan’s glans with kisses, covering it with your warm, wet lips and swirling, hot pink tongue.  You massage Evan’s manhood while gently slurping and sucking up Evan’s salty offerings.  Evan’s cock tastes a bit fishy, but perhaps that is only in your mind.

You are now covered with Evan’s semen.  It drips down and pools in the center of your breasts.  You are overwhelmed by the pungent aroma of Evan’s pride.

You go and wash up.  You find yourself suddenly feeling fatigued and a bit dizzy.  With a creeping sense of worry, you lie down in bed.

That night, you fall asleep and soon drift into [[an absolutely horrific nightmare.]]

After enduring the awful cries of the dying fish, you snap awake with a gasping shudder.  “Holy fuck that was //terrifying...//&quot;  //Maybe one of those fish gave me food poisoning or something?  At least I am awake now… that dream was just too weird.//

“It wasn’t a dream, Taylor!” an undulating, otherworldly [[voice from behind screeches at you.]]

Its mouth, adorned with curled barbels resembling a moustache, opens as if to bite at you, or perhaps just as a last gasp, a futile battle between its gills losing out against the harsh atmosphere.  The dead fish eyes snap into activity, and swivel towards you accusingly.  Just as you are about to scream for help, the fish begins to cry, weeping tears of blood onto the cabin floor.

“Why did you kill us, Taylor?” the fish-ghost asks you in perfect, London accented English.  “My partner and I were just swimming along, minding our own fishy-business when your //cruel deception// ripped us apart!  That damn orange fuzzy thing was too tasty looking to ignore!  It is an //unnatural abomination!//  I had just got a new job at the seaweed hut… But you killed me and devoured my body on my first day of work!  I have a family and my kids just joined the School of Fish!  You ruined everything.  All my plans, dispersed and settled into the muck.  You have murdered me, Taylor!  Now my children are //fatherless!//” wails the fish-ghost.

You are so shocked that you have been unable to muster a single word in response.  //Is this real!?  Is my brain fucking melting?  What the fuck is happening!?  Ahhhhhhhhh…. I guess it doesn’t matter... //  

The finned specter floats around above you, giving off an eery silvery glow.  It appears to be waiting for a response from you.

Fish don’t even feel pain, so stop being a pussy and resign yourself to your existence as a fish-stick.”

The fish-ghost gasps in horror and then disappears in a puff of pink smoke.  

You wake up the next morning with a mild headache but otherwise feel fine.  You vaguely recall a strange dream but you can’t //quite// remember it in detail.  You now have an odd craving for seafood.

“I am sorry!  I didn’t mean to… or well, I kinda did… but I didn’t know… or I did but I didn’t think about the consequences of my actions!”  You begin to sweat as you become conscious of how lame your apology sounds.

The fish flops with outrage.  Its gills open and close menacingly.  “So you admit your crime!” the fish yells, his round, flat eyes bulging with rage.  “I owe you no mercy for your honesty.  I will give you only //my wrath!//  Whenever you close your eyes you will see me!  I will haunt you, Taylor!  Blub, blub, blub!  Haunt you until you //drown yourself in sorrow//, ha ha ha!”

You try and find some neutral ground.  “Evan, I am having fun too.  We have done some crazy shit together but we need to be careful too.  We are just two perverts on a boat.  What the fuck are we even doing out here?”

Evan moves to the seat directly behind you.  “I know you’re not really my girlfriend or anything… but maybe you should be.  I don’t just like you because you’re sexy.  Taylor, I like you because… you’re //you,//” he explains with surprisingly bluntness.  

//The fuckin’ guy just masturbated into a lake and now he is confessing to me!?

You don’t get a chance to react as Evan suddenly kisses you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/canoe.jpg&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
“Mmmmphmm…”  You try and push Evan away but the awkward angle and Evan’s immense size makes that impossible.  Evan seems determined to kiss you into submission and amazingly it works.  His strong, toned arms wrap around you.  After a few moments, you lose the will to fight.

You drift throughout the still lake while making out with your best friend. 

After what seems like ages, you withdraw from Evan.   You float in a state of suspended disbelief.  “Why did we do that?” [[you wonder aloud.]]  //What the fuck just happened!?//

When I am around you, common sense just flies right out the window and I only see you and how badly I want you.”

You have no idea what to say to Evan, so you choose to say nothing.  Two of you stay close together, just idly drifting across the glassy water until it begins to cool off.

“That was kind of fun,” you admit.  Evan grins.  “//The boat ride,//” you clarify.  //The kiss was just… too much!//

Still, you cannot deny that your time with Evan on the lake and your close proximity has awakened a few passions of your own.

You help Evan pull the boat ashore.

Evan looks at you like he cannot wait to strip you bare.  You bet he as already mentally done so.  //This damn pervert…  Fuck!  Too bad he isn’t the only one...// 

“Come with me, Taylor,” Evan beckons you.

[[Follow Evan into the cabin|Then so be it.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="998" name="You feel your heart being gripped by a vice of panic." tags="" position="1997,16200" size="100,100">“Evan!” you shout again, mentally aware that every second counts.  //He could be drowning!//  You try and dive but your life jacket prevents you.

Your shaking hands struggle with the straps.  Once loose, you finally drop into the water.

You move closer to the canoe using your jacket as a flotation device.  When you reach the canoe you take a deep breath and dive as deep down as you can.

You frantically dive over and over again.  //Holy fuck!  Evan is dead… or drowning…  I can’t find him!//  You want to cry out in frustration but instead you instinctively devote your efforts to finding your friend.

You dive until it becomes obvious your timetable has expired.  You begin to weep.  &quot;Evan...  where are you?&quot;

“You done swimming yet?” Evan casually asks you.

You turn to Evan and your eyes light up.  Your friend has risen from the dead!  “Evan!?  You’re alive!  Oh thank fuck…  I was scared I lost… where did you go?”

“I was in the canoe,” he sheepishly answers.

You instantly become pissed off.  “I thought you were fucking dead!  And here you are //hiding…// You’re unbelievable, Evan.”

“Wow.  You really got upset when you thought I died.  You must //really// like me,” Evan teases you.

“Waaaaaah!  You’re a fucking asshole, Evan!”  You swim ashore and walk back to camp, leaving [[Evan to deal with the canoe by himself.]]

The noise, the warm glow, the all encompassing pleasure and confidence overwhelms you and you become certain that your life will never be //quite// the same again.  

Instead of letting you enjoy your blissful moment, Mitch takes command.  With an iron grip, he leads you into his bedroom where he forcefully undresses you.

After you are naked, Mitch follows suit.  He sits on the edge of bed and strokes his rapidly stiffening cock.  “Come over here and sit on it,” Mitch casually orders you.

You are so flooded with strange feelings and chemicals, that you obey without question.  Besides, Mitch has already trained you quite well.

As you move towards Mitch, your hand brushes your crotch.  You are frightened at how warm you feel.  You can’t help your body’s natural responses.  To your immense embarrassment, [[you can feel your love juice dripping down your thigh.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1001" name="You close your eyes and rub your soft legs together." tags="" position="14741,6786" size="100,100">You still feel like a stranger in your own body, so you aim to //familiarize// yourself.  Every time you look down, you are conscious of how much you have changed.  Your hands roam over your unfamiliar curves and the delicate flesh that covers your body.  You can’t help but touch your butt and the outside of your new pussy.

“Oh my god that feels really good!”  //I hope my sex drive didn’t transfer over when I changed… otherwise I know that once I get going I won’t be able to stop.  Curse this Roux libido!//

You just //have// to continue.  As you stroke your inner labia, you feel a distracting warmth begin to pool and emanate from your vagina.

“Ooooh!” you squeak as you brush up against your clitoris.  “Eaah!”  The little bud is too sensitive to stroke directly.  It reminds you far too much of your missing manhood that you suddenly stop.

“Fuck!  Way to ruin the moment, Taylor…  now I am thinking about //dicks!//  God damnit!”  

Memories of your missing manhood… and Damien’s float through your mind.

[[You soak until the water… and your own head begins to cool off.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1002" name="You soak until the water… and your own head begins to cool off." tags="" position="14582,6841" size="100,100">After finishing your bath and dabbing yourself dry with a towel, you retreat to Damien’s room.  You steal some clothes.  You change into an oversized T-shirt.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayoversizet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Damn… I look good in anything!” you remark as you catch your reflection in Damien’s mirrored closet.  You shake your head and mentally chastise yourself.  //It isn’t that I want to look like this or anything!  I guess I am just naturally cute.//

You suddenly feel weary.  Your hot bath has put you in the mood to sleep.  You head to the downstairs and pass out a few seconds after throwing yourself down onto the couch.

The next day, you wake up after Damien has already left for you work.  You feel claustrophobic and decide to take a brief walk.  After a cautious stroll through Damien&#39;s neighborhood, you feel a bit refreshed but overly self conscious.  You soon decide to head back to Damien&#39;s.

You spend the rest of your day searching the internet for answers that may not even exist.

Damien doesn’t arrive home from work [[until almost eight in the evening.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1003" name="until almost eight in the evening." tags="" position="14740,6942" size="100,100">To your surprise, he doesn’t appear overly drunk.  Damien grins at you as he carries in several plastic shopping bags of seemingly random items.  He sets down one with a loud //clunk.//  Excluding the bag with a potential bowling ball, it looks a bit like Damien just robbed a pharmacy.

“Taylor, I have a great idea and I already got us some items to experiment with!” Damien announces once inside.

“Is that whipping cream?” you shout in alarm as your eyes fall on one of the open bags.

“That is for later.  Don’t worry.”

“I am fucking worried!”  //Even more so now!//  “That better be for a banana split.”

Damien grins at you.  “Most of this is for legitimate experiments!  I am a simple scientist.” Damien asserts.  You can’t help but roll your eyes.  

“I am never trusting you again, you big ass creep!  The next green potion you give me I am going to break on the table and then cut you with the shards of glass,” you threaten.

Damien shakes his head in irritation and clucks his tongue.  “Taylor, we have already established our mutually beneficial relationship.”

[[“I just want to return to normal!”]] you whine.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1004" name="“I just want to return to normal!”" tags="" position="14584,6983" size="100,100">“And I think I can help with that!  I got a few things I want to test out tonight.  Let’s go check out //my basement.//”

“Way to make that sound menacing.  Why your basement?   What’s down there?”  //If he says, “sex dungeon” I am going to murder him.//

“I guess you could call it… my lab,” Damien answers.  “It used to be a sex dungeon but I repurposed it.  We all must make sacrifices for progress.”

You blink twice.  “You have a lab!?  Here?  One we can use to figure out what happened to me?”

“Taylor, you know I have always been a big science geek.  As for quality, you will see for yourself, but I got a decent set of kit.  I think with what I brought tonight we might be able to learn a few useful things about your condition...”

“Why have you been keeping this from me?”

“I didn&#39;t want to get your hopes up.  I wanted to pick up a few things to some tests.  [[The truth is, I have been experimenting with a little bit of your blood at night…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1005" name="The truth is, I have been experimenting with a little bit of your blood at night…”" tags="" position="14741,7089" size="100,100">“Huh?  //You took my fucking blood!?//  What the fuck?  You goddamned vampire!  Did you like stick me with a needle or some shit while I was asleep?  //And then// you took advantage of me?”  You are aware how shrill and angry you sound but you can’t help it.  “Fuck you, Damien!”

“Hey!  I needed it to… learn how to help you,” Damien explains with a notable pause.  //Lying asshole...//

You have a very bad feeling about this situation…  Damien has lied to you in the past but you are desperate and forced to either trust in your old friend… or strike off into the terrifying world alone.  It seems Damien has plans for you… either as a sex slave or a lab rat.  //Fuck!  But he is really smart and there is probably a decent chance he can help me figure this all out… if I can bribe or manipulate him into doing so...//

You look at Damien’s bright, alert eyes and can’t help but feel a slight lack of confidence when it comes to the wit department.

“Let me show you what I discovered last night,” Damien says as he leads the way into his basement, the old wood stairs creaking obnoxiously with each step.

[[Go into Damien’s basement.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1006" name="Go into Damien’s basement." tags="" position="14589,7133" size="100,100">True to Damien’s word, the lab is surprisingly well equipped.  You suspect much of his equipment has been stolen from highschool and the hospital he works at.  You note several shelves of labelled chemicals along with a large number of books and beakers.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/basementlab.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Maybe I will actually learn something useful!// you silently hope.  The chance of you being abducted by a mysterious corporation will be much lower if you keep a low profile.  That means making use of whatever you have access to.  //I really don’t want to be Damien’s labrat though...//

“I got something for you!” Damien declares.  He takes out an obviously heavy box and opens it, [[revealing a bottle of bright yellow liquid.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1007" name="revealing a bottle of bright yellow liquid." tags="" position="14742,7225" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/yellowpotion.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You object right off the bat.  “Ohhhh no-no-no nooo! NO! Not this shit again.  What did I say earlier about offering me fucking potions made from unnamed chemicals?”

“This is a //different// potion! This one is //yellow,//” Damien insists, speaking slowly, as if to an idiot.

You barely resist the urge to throw the bottle at Damien’s head.  “You have got to be kidding me.”

“Nope.  This is totally legit,” Damien replies with a straight face.  You open your mouth to argue with Damien but he bulls on.  “And it seems to react with elements in your blood.  This is definitely worth a shot.  I don’t know what it will do… but it will probably do //something.//”

“That sounds awful.  What if that something is making my head explode?”

Damien nods his head thoughtfully at the scenario.  “That is a possibility.  Scientific progress often comes at great cost.”

[[“Fuck this!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1008" name="“Fuck this!”" tags="" position="14592,7270" size="100,100">“Well, if you aren’t willing to experiment you will probably be stuck like that forever.  Not a huge loss I guess…” Damien muses as he eyes your chest.

You heft the disgusting looking potion.  “Dude…  Where did you get this anyway?  What is it made out of?  It looks like fucking piss!”

Damien looks away.  He bites his lip and seems a tad embarrassed.  “I know a guy…” Damien begins and you groan at how shady his explanation already sounds four words in.  “And he is well connected.  I needed something a bit special for this experiment and he provided it for me.  It wasn’t fucking cheap either; I am adding that shit to your tab by the way.”

“Dude!  I had sex with you and sucked your wee-wee!  If anything - //you// owe //me//.”

Damien shrugs and gives you a faint smile.  “My “wee-wee” thanks you.  And I am a very reciprocal person.  That is why I got this,” he says with a gesture to the potion in your hand.  “If we-I can figure out what happened to you and how to control it… Taylor, I will be fucking rich and super famous.  I will even throw you a double bone: my penis and part ownership in the company.  I need you to consent to these tests.  It isn’t legal… but it could easily make us both millionaires,” Damien speculates.

[[“Or I could explode!” you angrily counter.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1009" name="“Or I could explode!” you angrily counter." tags="" position="14748,7374" size="200,200">Damien shrugs.  “Or that.  All great endeavours have their risks.  It is up to you, though.  All I know is that whatever changed you seems to react to whatever compound is in that bottle.”
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
“Huh?  Wait-what?  You don’t know what is in it either!”

“Not really, no,” Damien admits.  “I just know the basics...”

“What aren’t you telling me!?” you demand.

Damien sighs.  “It is //slightly// radioactive once you take it out of its lead case.”

You cannot believe Damien’s stupidity.  With surprising calmness, you set the bottle on the table and back away from it.  “Gee, asshole, thanks for the cancer,” you remark through clenched teeth.

Damien frowns at you.  “I think cancer is the least of your worries.  And I said //slightly// radioactive.  Even a banana is relatively high in radioact--”

“Damien just shut up for a second and let me think.”  You stare at the potion that seems to be beckoning you forth.  //Is it giving off a slight glow or is that just me?//  Maybe you are just a shot glass of radioactive piss away from returning to your own body.  //I have already been exposed to stuff like this...  Still… the dangers are clearly huge…. But maybe I will end up with super powers!  That is a thing, right?//  You feel conflicted.  You still have yet to learn anything important about your condition but you don&#39;t really have a deathwish either.  Can you really let such a chance slip by?

[[Drink Damien’s concoction]]
[[Argue it needs more refinement and testing first]]x

You silence the screaming voices in your mind.  //I have to get the fuck out of here before I go nuts…//  You walk back to yellow potion and pour yourself a glass.  It smells like vinegar.  You steel yourself, take a deep breath, and then plug your nose as you pour the bubbling liquid down your throat.

“Aggh!  Ech!  Gross!”  You were not expecting the bizarre assault on your pallet.

The yellow potion tastes like a fruity cocktail with a disgusting undertone of gasoline.  It leaves a foul metallic aftertaste on your tongue.  As soon as you swallow, you regret your decision as you bend over and retch.  The liquid burns your esophagus on the way down.

A warm flush, like the creep of alcohol after taking a shot, slowly spreads through your body.  For a few moments it feels pleasant... until it doesn&#39;t.  The next thing you know, you are gasping for breath.

“Damien… help….  I am… dying…”  Damien just watches you without acknowledgment, impassively marking down notes on a pad of paper.

You feel your point of view shift even lower, as if you are shrinking.  “Fuck!  This is obviously not working!” you curse and shout as you stomp your way upstairs and run into the bathroom.  You stare at the mirror with open-mouthed shock as your appearance begins to shift and transform.  You fall to your knees as a sickening tremor spreads throughout your extremities.

“Oh my … fucking… arghh….”  //I am definitely going to die!  Why did I drink that shit?  What the fuck is wrong with me!?  Ahhhhhhhhhh!//  A strange, icy tingle spreads through your body.  You feel a dull pain in your hips as your bones seem to compress themselves.

You blink as your skin tone begins to change, becoming noticeably lighter.  Your hair also transforms, spreading out from root to tip, becoming a golden blonde until almost none of your original brown pigment remains.

After an agonizing ten minutes, the pain stops entirely and you stagger to your feet.  [[You are horrified when you next look in the mirror.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1011" name="Argue it needs more refinement and testing first" tags="" position="14892,7675" size="100,100">Refinement sminement!  Maybe next time.

“W-what happened to me?” you wonder as you stare at your reflection.  Your voice sounds high pitched and unfamiliar.  You had only just gotten somewhat used to your new soprano and now your voice is even higher.  You sound like a little kid.  //And I kinda look like one too.  Fuck.  I shrunk!  Errr--I am shrinking!//  Before your very eyes, your clothes begin to slip and fall off your slender new body as you shed another two inches. After an agonizing transformation, you inspect your changes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ltrans.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Noooooooo!  Not again!//  

You cannot help but gape at the girl in the mirror.  “Is… that me!?  What the fuck?  This can&#39;t be happenening again.... Why did I listen to Damien?&quot;  You look at your shockingly slender hands and despair.  &quot;I guess I am never opening another jar again...&quot;  Your eyes catch your own in the mirror.  &quot;Wow, I look so //young!//”  You estimate you look at least three or four years younger than you did before.  You doubt many would place you at a day over eighteen.  

Hoping it is all just a dream, you run your hands over your body.  Although your breasts seem to have been reduced in size, the round outline still remains while your face and body are still unmistakably soft and female.

“I have transformed into a little girl…  NooooOOOoooOOOoo!  [[This is the worst fate imaginable.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1013" name="This is the worst fate imaginable.”" tags="" position="14584,7685" size="100,100">“Oh stop being melodramatic, Taylor.  You look hot!” Damien comments from the doorway.  “Your ass is amazing.  I love the new look, by the way.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ltransb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“What the hell, man?  That’s your first fuckin’ thought!?  Look at me, you asshole!”

“I am.  Like I said, you are //soooo// hot. AND you&#39;re super cute to boot!”

“GRRrrr!  FUCK!!  You pedo!  This is even worse than before!”

“Hey you are of age!  We are both adults so anything we do is completely legal,” Damien argues.

“Huh!?  “Anything we do?”  We are //never// doing anything again!  [[You ruined me, you moron!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1014" name="You ruined me, you moron!”" tags="" position="14732,7779" size="100,100">“Honestly, I think this change is a huge improvement,” Damien opines.  Damien shifts uncomfortably and you notice he has a prominent erection tenting his pants.

“DAMIEN!  Get a hold of yourself.  //Now//,” you warn Damien through clenched teeth.  “If you touch me again I will kill you.  I swear!”

“Noooo!  You can’t do that to me.  You’re just soooo cute now.  There is no way I can keep my hands off you.  You’re //adorable.//  I just want to cuddle with you and fondle you for a bit.”

“Touch me with one of those dirty hands and you will lose the fingers!”

Damien seems unperturbed by your threats of violence.  “Hmm… but you are awful small now, Taylor.  Do you even have the strength to resist?  I bet if I tickle you for a bit we will discover you are a little tsundere sex pot waiting to be stirred up… by my cock,” he adds with a leering grin.

//Is he threatening me?  What a dick!  Even if he is joking… there is something seriously wrong with this guy!//  You shake your head in a state of angry disbelief.  “You are seriously really messed up in the head.  Being turned on by young looking girls, [[you’re just sick.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1015" name="you’re just sick.”" tags="" position="14587,7832" size="100,100">“Yep.  //Love-sick// for some petite beauties,” Damien answers with a laugh.  “It is evolution, Taylor,” Damien explains as if you are a real child.  “Your body is perfect for sex.  You’re young… and I bet you are so fucking tight… Ughh… I just would take you and fuck you so hard uh….” Damien imagines as he rubs at his crotch.  “Yep, nothing to get weirded out over,” he insists.  “It is just the two of us doing what we want-have to do.  Should we go upstairs or fuck right here?” Damien asks you, point blank.

You cannot help but imagine having sex in this new tiny body and cringe at the resulting image.  Damien’s girthy cock would tear you to shreds if you attempted such a thing.  //Fuck!  What the hell am I even thinking about!?  Calm down, Taylor!  Snap out of it!//

“What you have done to me certainly isn’t consensual!” you counter.  “You fuckin’ creep,” you add for good measure.

Damien breathes deeply and his eyes noticeably glaze over.  “Mmmm...Are you sure about that?” he asks you as brushes his hand across your leg, his fingers on a gentle path down your thighs.

Your body reacts without your input.  You feel your tiny pussy begin to tingle in anticipation.  

“I-I--...” you stammer.  You don’t know what to say.  

“Taylor, our fates are already tied together.  No one will believe you looking like that… it would be impossible for you to get shit done easily.  I am your only ally so we might as well fuck.  You have nowhere else to go.  So we should keep each other company while we work together.  We are stuck with each other, so we might as well learn to enjoy ourselves, right?”

“Oh my god…”  Your head is spinning.  

[[“I need you to help me!”]]
[[“Are you sure the cops will believe you?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1016" name="“I need you to help me!”" tags="" position="14733,7966" size="100,100">“Damien, please…  I need you to help me!”

Damien’s face lights up at your words.  “Great!  That’s settled then!”  Damien then scoops you up as if you are a weightless little doll.  Your tall friend then carries you upstairs and into his room while you squeal and protest in vain.

You feel humiliated.  You haven’t been carried like this since you were a //baby.//  You push back against Damien’s strong arms and broad chest and find him to be immovable and impossibly strong, like a wall of muscle and steel.

You feel powerless and completely at Damien’s mercy.

“Heeeelllp!  Let me down, you brute!”

As you shout for help, your face gets mashed into Damien’s armpit and you are silenced.  You can do nothing except squirm and inhale smell the strong odor of Damien’s sweat mingled with his spicy smelling deodorant.  

Damien cradles you like a baby in his arms for a moment before he gently sets you down on his  bed.

[[“This is going to be awesome!”]] Damien predicts.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1017" name="“Are you sure the cops will believe you?”" tags="" position="14432,7924" size="100,100">Damien frowns. “You’re not going to call the cops,” he replies without a second thought, calling your bluff.

“Fuck you then!” you shout before changing your tone. “I am just a scared little girl who needs help!~ I am being held hostage by this insanely creepy dude named Damien! Please officer, saaave~ me!” you demonstrate some choice words you might use against him.

Damien’s frown deepens. You match his gaze, like a brave bunny staring down a giant. 

“Ahhh! Fine!” Damien relents. He then proceeds to unleash a litany of curses under his breath. He knocks a bunch of stuff off the table before wrapping his head in his hands.

You decide a change of subject is in order. “Where the hell are you getting all this shit from anyway?”

Damien’s mood remains dark. “The chemicals? Ahh… It isn’t easy. I have this contact…” he vaguely replies.

“Uh huh… AND? Who’s your contact.”

Damien answers slowly. “His name is Dr. Trustworthy.” 

“Wait a second. You’ve been putting my// life// at risk by buying chemicals from a guy named //Dr. Trustworthy?//”

“That’s right.”

“Are you fucking kidding me!?” you explode.

Damien looks annoyed by your reaction. “No!” is his terse reply.

“And you don’t think there is anything shady about that?” You can’t help but let a note of anger temper your words.

The slender man shrugs. “Something shady about a guy who sells radioactive potions? Not really. There is a market for everything. He also sells //pangolin scales,//” Damien adds, as if that is somehow relevant.

You facepalm. “Agggg…” //Maybe I have overestimated Damien’s intelligence...// “With a name like //Dr. Trustworthy// how could you //not// believe this guy!?”

Damien nods. “Yeah, fair enough.”

“I am being sarcastic! Damien, how in the fuck did you even get into medical school?”

Damien looks wounded. “It is because I am super smart! Besides, I think the Dr. Trustworthy thing is just an alias or some weird branding attempt. I doubt the guy has any medical credentials. He is more of a supplier or a pharmacist than a true doctor.”

“Obviously!”

Damien sighs. “Do you want to meet the “doc” or not?”

[[“I guess we don’t really have a choice…”]]
[[“No way, that sounds way too shady!”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1018" name="“This is going to be awesome!”" tags="" position="14584,8032" size="100,100">You glare at Damien.  “Speak for yourself!”

“I am speaking for both of us,” Damien insists as he unbuttons his shirt, revealing a set of lean muscles.

“No!  Just no!  Stay the hell away from me!” you shout as Damien inches towards you.  “If you touch me I will kick your ass.”

Damien pauses.  His face scrunches up and he looks somewhat wounded.  “I don’t think it is like that,” he says as he takes off his shirt and sits down on the bed, pushing you over with his incredible weight as he lies down.  Without a further word, Damien’s huge hands begin to fondle your entire body.  Powerless in his hands, he grabs at your ass roughly, digging his fingers into your soft flesh until you yelp in pain.

In Damien’s arms, held in his unbreakable grip, you feel utterly helpless, like a wounded animal that has given up and submitted to being devoured by a predator.

Seeing no way to escape Damien’s clutches, you grit your teeth and resolve to stoically bear your mistreatment until a moment to escape appears.

“Oww… you’re too damn rough!” you complain.

“Suck it up, man,” Damien says with a laugh as he gives your ass a fairly hard smack.

“Ouch!”

[[“Don’t be a bad girl, Taylor,”]] Damien warns.  “Otherwise I will have to //punish// you.”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1019" name="“Don’t be a bad girl, Taylor,”" tags="" position="14732,8124" size="100,100">
“What is wrong with you!?” you yell at Damien but he ignores you and continues his erotic escalation.  Damien seems to become more unhinged by the minute.  “Let me gooo!” you wail until Damien does something unthinkable: he covers his lips with your own.

“Mmmmphgagrggagblahhh!  WHAT THE FUCK, DAMIEN!?”

“I can’t help myself, Taylor…” Damien pants.  “You’re just too cute… I need you.”

With a strange warmth spreading throughout your body, you feel your resistance fade.  Soon your protests die completely as you submit and let Damien molest you.  “Oh wow… you’re so soft… I like you so much better like this!”  Damien gropes you for what feel like an eternity.  Eventually your whole body is red and tingling.  You want to scream but Damien’s hand is so close to your privates that it is making your groin uncomfortably hot.  //And… wet… Nooo!  Why is this happening to me?//

Damien shifts position and places his large, muscular arm between your legs so that your labia are spread across his forearm.  He smiles, clearly feeling your warmth, separated by nothing but air.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienfeel.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien finally rubs your slick vagina, pulling away a long strand and fingers coated with love juice.  //My love juice… fuck…  Ahh!  This is so wrong!  I need to get out of here!//

“See?  You seem to be enjoying yourself, Taylor,” Damien notes.  He then returns his middle finger and casually penetrates you.

“Uhhhn!  Don’t!”  Even Damien’s middle finger seems too large for your tiny pussy.  //Anything bigger would tear me apart!//  Damien finger fucks you until you finally work up the courage and strength to [[try and push Damien’s hand away.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1020" name="try and push Damien’s hand away." tags="" position="14579,8181" size="100,100">Damien chuckles at your response and lets you hold back his hand.  You squeak and shimmy away, trying to stand up on the bed while willing yourself to flee.

“Taylor, sit back down,” Damien commands you, a note of iron in his voice.

You glance longingly at the door but think better of escaping after a moment of thought about where you would go.  With a sigh, you decide to obey.  //This will just have to be our secret… Soon this will all be a memory!// you desperately hope.  Yet the heat between your legs keeps growing.  You become conscious of an uncomfortable yearning; an internal itch in your lower belly.  

Damien grabs you by your hips and pulls you back down to the mattress.  He repositions you as if you were weightless.  Damien smirks at you as he begins to kiss your stomach, his face gradually descending upon your burning nether regions.

“Nooooooooooooooo!”  Your howl quickly morphs into a moan of pleasure [[as Damien works his hot, wet tongue into your vagina.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1021" name="as Damien works his hot, wet tongue into your vagina." tags="" position="14724,8271" size="100,100">You feel so uncomfortable you want nothing more than to crawl away but Damien holds you firmly down.  The foreign sensation of Damien’s tongue invading your pussy makes you buck your hips and squirm.  //This feels so wrong!  Eww!  This is so fucked!  I have Damien’s tongue inside me!  In ... my pussy... I have a pussy and it is being eaten!  Faaa...//  At first you did not find the experience enjoyable but after a couple of minutes of letting Damien tongue and kiss your pussy you begin to change your mind.

The pressure inside you builds until your internal dam bursts and unleashes a wave of shivering bliss that reverberates all the way down to your toes.  You become awash in endorphins, vaginal secretions and pleasurable warmth as your hips rock violently against Damien’s face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damieneat.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh!  Oh!  OH!  Hoooly fuuuuuckk!  Uhhhh………….”

That was definitely the most crazy orgasm of your life.

“Uhh…. uhhh…. Uhhnnn…. Damien… why did you do that to me?”  You feel like you are overheating.  You are dripping with sweat and love juice.

“To get you ready!” Damien replies.  “You are going to have to be wet and willing in order to take my monster cock.”  As if to underscore his statement, Damien strips off his pants and boxers and [[presents you with his massive penis.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1022" name="presents you with his massive penis." tags="" position="14578,8337" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damiendick.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien’s cock completely fills up your vision.  With its appearance, you feel yourself overheat another ten degrees.  You slap away the first ten thoughts that slip into your head until the dam bursts and you capitulate to your desires.  //I have to do something… I can’t let him fuck me with that thing!//  

You muster your courage and shake your head.  “Nooo, Damien….  I can’t…  It is too big… I just can’t take //that thing// inside me,” you stubbornly insist.

“You already did once before!” Damien objects.

“But… not like this!  I will die… like seriously…  I am too young to die!  And I am not going to get killed in such a disgusting way!  What the hell would they write on my tombstone?” you wonder.

“Here lies Taylor Roux: I shouldn’t have drank the yellow potion,” Damien suggests.

“That was a rhetorical question!” you snap.  “Fuck, I wish I could go back in time…”

“Hah.  I like you way better this way to be honest.”

“I don’t care what you think!”

“Well, we will just have to keep experimenting.  Speaking of //experiments,// how about we try out your new body… specifically that little pussy of yours.  I bet you are tight as fuck.”

“I am not having sex with you while I am like this.”

[[“I will settle for a blowjob,”]] Damien concedes.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1023" name="Try and change the subject." tags="" position="4392,10360" size="100,100">&quot;Do you play these games, or just talk about them?&quot; you taunt Craig.  &quot;How about a match?&quot; you request with a gesture at the nearby TV and console.

His eyes widen as he realizes your meaning.  &quot;You w-w-w-ant to play with me?&quot;

&quot;Sure.  It is a good way for us to get to know each other.&quot;  //And if I get paid to play video games for a few hours a week with this big manchild… well every real job in the world sounds worse than that!  Jackpot!//

Craig starts up a fighting game.  You haven&#39;t played this particular one, but it is reminiscent of every button masher you have played in recent history.

Craig isn&#39;t a terrible player, but even without any practice, you learn quickly and are soon dominating every match.

&quot;You&#39;re so good…&quot; Craig remarks with amazement as you combo his ridiculous wrestler character into the dirt with your agile femme fatale.  &quot;S-sophie used to play… but she was really bad…&quot;

&quot;Hah!  She probably just let you win.&quot;

&quot;T-tammmy… you know Sophie?&quot;

You try choose your words carefully.  &quot;Uh… yeah, sort of, we used to be friends but it has been a few years since I last seen her.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot;

[[&quot;So what games do you have?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1024" name="&quot;So what games do you have?&quot;" tags="" position="4244,10414" size="100,100">Craig brightens.  &quot;I have lots of good ones!  I got //Soul Blades// and that dragon game where you fight with balls!&quot;

&quot;Show me!&quot;

You play a few bouts and find yourself having fun.  //It has been a while since I played a game like this...//

After about half an hour, Sandra returns.  &quot;Oh great!  I am so glad to see you two getting along.&quot;  She smiles as if a bright idea just occurred to her.  &quot;Since you are doing so well… do you think it would be alright if I stepped out for a few hours?  Is that okay with you, Craig?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Craig shouts.

&quot;Sure thing,&quot; you reply with a shrug.  You had suspected Mrs. Bell might try something like this.  Sandra&#39;s relief is immediate and obvious.  

&quot;Thank you so much.&quot;  Sandra then mouths the words, &quot;I owe you.&quot;  You notice Sandra has already changed into a striking red v-neck dress.  //Who in the hell is she going to meet dressed up like that?// you cannot help but idly wonder.  You recall Mr. Bell is a fairly easy going guy.  //If she is going to meet up with him he is a lucky man!//

&quot;Just a sec, Craig.&quot;  You pause the game and follow Sandra out into the hall and entryway.

Sandra gives you a hug.  &quot;I promise I won&#39;t be too late.  There is food in the fridge.  You have my number if you need anything!&quot; Sandra says to you as she departs.  You note Sandra runs away from the house like she was just released from two years of house arrest.  //Hmmm… maybe that is pretty accurate…  I bet Craig can be a handful.  He seems pretty easy to please though!//

You return to Craig&#39;s room and play a very weird coloring game that appears to be designed for ten year olds.  Craig seems mesmerized and you smile and play along, splashing the screen with [[a rainbow of colors.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1025" name="a rainbow of colors." tags="" position="4392,10512" size="100,100">After an hour or so of painting crude pastoral scenes, Craig suddenly stops playing the game and throws down his controller so hard the item nearly breaks as it bounces off the floor.  You sit up in surprise.

&quot;I am //THIRSTY//!&quot; Craig announces in a shockingly deep voice.

You raise an eyebrow at him.  In that moment, even though you are pretty sure Craig is at least twenty, he looks like an absolute child.  //Yeah… here we go… let the weirdness begin...//

You take Craig&#39;s hint.  //I guess I am supposed to be looking after him...//  &quot;Craig, what would you like to drink?&quot; you ask your ward.

&quot;I want the good juice!&quot; he answers, as if you should understand by that description alone.  

&quot;The //good juice?//  Which one is that?&quot; you ask Craig.  

&quot;Uhh…. Uhh… the //good// one!&quot; Craig repeats, somewhat flabbergasted. 

//Fuck, is this going to be a guessing game?  I hope Sandra appreciates this...//  You sigh.  &quot;Is it orange juice?&quot;

&quot;N-no!  Ew!  That is the //worst// juice!&quot; Craig remarks with a shiver.  &quot;Makes me pee!&quot; he adds angrily.

&quot;I am pretty sure that is a quality of all drinks….&quot; you remark dryly.  &quot;So, do you like apple juice?&quot;

&quot;Ugh!  That is even worse than the orange juice.&quot;

&quot;Craig, you will have to tell me what color it is or show me the juice.  Is it made from a powder or concentrate?&quot;

Craig ignores you and lies down on the floor.  &quot;Agh!  Help!  Aghhh!  Accckkkgaarggllaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; he begins to choke and mewl.

You instinctively move to help him.

&quot;Craig!  What the hell is happening?  Are you alright?  Your mom didn&#39;t say anything about seizures!&quot;

When you touch Craig&#39;s arm, he miraculously recovers.  &quot;I am just thirsty,&quot; he answers as if nothing is amiss and he [[wasn&#39;t just desperately choking a second earlier.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1026" name="wasn&#39;t just desperately choking a second earlier." tags="" position="4249,10566" size="100,100">It takes most of your willpower to calm down but you manage to resist smacking Craig.

&quot;Show me which juice you want.&quot;  You follow Craig to the kitchen where Craig opens the freezer and presents you with a canned frozen drink concentrate for &quot;fruity tooty punch.&quot;

&quot;The good juice!&quot; Craig says while gesturing at the can.

You pull the tab off and remove the lid.  Craig immediately snatches it out of your hand.  He then begins to greedily lick the frozen juice from the top of the lid.

Craig notices you staring at him and flushes red.  He then offers you a lick of the lid.

&quot;Uh… no thanks, that is all you!&quot;

You dump the concentrate into a jug and add a few cupfulls of water.  A few seconds later, you present Craig with his &quot;good juice.&quot;

Craig begins to drink with such intensity you soon suspect he intends to consume the entire jug himself right then and there.

[[Bewildered, you lean back and watch him.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1027" name="“Sure.  That would be sweet!”" tags="" position="13102,16901" size="100,100">While you are setting up a game Evan disappears.  He returns a moment later with a bottle and two glasses.  “What?  It is still early!” he defends himself as he pours two drinks.  He pushes one towards you.  

“Free booze?  Why the hell not? Cheers!”  You clink glasses and drink,  the strong liquor pours easily down your throat.

The two of you start to play a hockey game.  The alcohol dilutes your performance but you find yourself having a good time.

“Ha-ha!  Another one bites the dust!” you cheer as your team clinches a winning goal.  “I win!” 

“Let’s play something else!” Evan grumbles.  “You only won because you are distracting me.  And your team is //stacked//.  It’s totally unfair.”

“You’re kidding right?”  You start a new match, this time with the teams reversed.  You then proceed to go on a drunken ass kicking spree to prove your point.  “Ha-ha!  I win again,” you taunt Evan as you clinch another victory.  With a glance at Evan’s clock radio, you fight back a yawn.  You stretch out your slender limbs and consider calling it a night.

Evan moves behind you.  “Here, let me give you a massage…”

“You don’t have to,” you murmur.  You feel warm, stiff, and strangely disconnected from the moment.  You let Evan touch you.  Whether it was because you are drunk, or because of how good Evan’s touch feels, you cannot say.

Your lack of protest encourages Evan.  “Mmm…” you moan as Evan gently works your neck muscles.  You close your eyes and feel yourself zone out for a moment.  You are somewhat disappointed when Evan withdraws his hands [[but that dissatisfaction is short lived.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1028" name="but that dissatisfaction is short lived." tags="" position="13256,16947" size="100,100">You stiffen in shock when Evan starts to fondle your breasts from behind.  

“Oh my god!  These are fucking amazing!” Evan says as he gleefully gropes your chest.  

“Ev, why…?”

“I can’t help myself!  It isn’t a big deal, right?  I just want to check things out.  Your tits are wicked, Taylor.  They feel so soft and warm… uhh!  I have been wanting to touch these puppies since the moment I first saw you like this.”

You don’t know how to respond to such a statement.  You try and pull away but find Evan’s hold on you to be firm and unyielding.

You try and do your best to ignore Evan.  You start a new game but your performance suffers immensely as Evan gropes you.  You are soon defeated as your attentions are focused elsewhere… to an uncomfortable spark of arousal that is beginning to take light inside you.

Evan slides his hand under your shirt to gain better access to your flesh.  He pulls down your bra cups and then resumes his groping.  The feeling of Evan’s rough hands on your sensitive skin make you tense up.  The game controller drops from your hands.

Evan soon has both of his index fingers rubbing delicate circles over your areolas at the same time.  

“Wow… your nips are rock hard!” Evan notes.

[[“It isn’t my fault…”]] you mumble in embarrassment.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1029" name="“It isn’t my fault…”" tags="" position="13104,17045" size="100,100">“I know.  Your new body is just so… uhh…”  Evan trails off, unable to find the right word.  “//Hot,//” he finishes.  Evan hugs you from behind, repositioning the the palm of his hand over your crotch.  “Oh wow, Taylor.  You are like a// furnace// down here.  You’re just made for sex…  You are fucking painful to be around sometimes.”

“Don’t say shit like that to me…”

“Hey, Taylor, do you … wanna //do it?//”

Evan’s audacity absolutely floors you.  “Fuck no!  Get a grip, man.”

“I do have a grip…” Evan gives your breasts a playful squeeze.  “You know, Tay… We are both friends… and we are both horny and kind of drunk…”

Evan continues to molest you in silence for what seems like ages.  Eventually, Evan slides his fingers between the gap in your pants.  As soon as Evan touches your pubes, you lurch forward as alarm bells go off in your head and [[rouse you back to reality.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1030" name="rouse you back to reality." tags="" position="13248,17095" size="100,100">You scurry away on hands and knees and put some distance between you and Evan.  When you turn back to your friend, you feel a host of conflicting emotions… and the same gooey warmth and arousal that Mitch has instilled within you.

//No...//  You can feel your impulse control crumbling.  //Damnit… Evan was right!  I am getting turned on.  Damnit  DAMNIT!//  You feel like you have no control over your actions.  You have become a pleasure seeker and Mitch’s abuse has changed you in ways that you struggle to comprehend.

One thing is clear: you have undergone a sexual awakening.  Despite your best wishes, you’re aroused… and so is your friend.

Evan stands up, revealing an obvious erection.  Your eyes are drawn to Evan’s groin.  [[He then swaggers over to you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1031" name="He then swaggers over to you." tags="" position="13100,17201" size="100,100">//Zzzziiiip!//

As Evan unzips his fly, his dick flops out nearly hits you in the face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockshock.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Whoa!  What the fuck, Evan!?  Don’t just take your weiner out…. Holy fuck, man!”  You can feel the heat radiating off his prick.

“Pretty nice, eh?”

With your close up view, you don’t //quite// agree.  Evan’s dick is pretty big…  He is at least two inches larger than you once were.  To your dismay, you feel a tad jealous… and //hungry//.  After staring at Evan’s dick for a long, tense moment, your mouth eventually begins to water.

//I can’t believe I am thinking about this…// you fret.  You wish you could just turn your brain off.  //I just need to stop thinking…  Mmmm...//  [[You mindlessly submit to the pursuit of pleasure.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1032" name="You mindlessly submit to the pursuit of pleasure." tags="" position="13247,17247" size="100,100">You slowly lower your head over Evan’s groin.  //Just pretend it is a banana… Evan’s banana… Fuck.//

You feel dizzy as you touch Evan.  You wrap your hand around his penis and give him a few soft pumps.  Evan siffens in your hand.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/evansuck3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You sigh, finding your own breathing to be uncomfortably deep.  You flush and revel in a moment of drunk euphoria.  //I have already come this far… I might as well help Evan out...// You run your tongue up and down Evan’s shaft and, within a few seconds, he is fully engorged.  Although a bit smaller than Mitch, Evan&#39;s penis is enormous.  His size looks comically big next to your tiny hands.

Your head bobs up and down as you perform fellatio on your friend.  You kiss Evan’s dick.  You then cover Evan’s glans with your hot, wet mouth and swirl your tongue around while gently stroking Evan’s shaft.

“Holy fuck!  Have you… done this before?” Evan asks you.  “Ohhhh!  Wow… You have like a PhD in cocksucking!”

You stop your actions and glare at Evan.  You are about to walk away when Evan mollifies you.  “Hey!  I didn’t mean it that way…  I was just saying you’re awesome.  It feels really good.  Great job.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.”  WIth a large hand on the back of your head, you let Evan guide your face back to his penis.

Much to Evan’s delight, you resume your service.  You glide up and down Evan’s cock until your senses are muddled with a salty taste and heady, masculine scent.

“Mmmm….  Mhhhmmmm….”

Your eyes catch Evan’s.  He is looking at you with surprise while his mouth remains open in a silent moan of pleasure.  “Have you always been like this?” Evan asks you.  “Taylor, you need to drink more often!  And....you know, if you need a cock to suck, I am always here.”

[[“Please just shut up and cum,”]] you request.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1033" name="“Please just shut up and cum,”" tags="" position="13102,17353" size="100,100">“Yes ma’am!”

“Don’t call me that!”

Evan ignores you.  “Oh my god!  Here it comes!  Taylor, I am cumming!” Evan announces as he begins to rapidly stroke his cock onto your face.

“Evan!  Wait-- I don’t want that shit on my faaa-----”  You are splattered with cum before you can finish your sentence.  “---ce…  Fucking damnit Evan!  Look at what you have done!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanfacial2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I ~am!” Evan moans as he continues to jerk off, the last vestiges of his orgasm still spasm throughout his body.   //Well, I am already dirty now...//  As Evan finishes, you thrust out your chin and take Evan’s load like a boxer.  After a few dribbling spurts, Evan has your lips covered in his seed.  

As the sheer magnitude of your embarrassing actions sink in, Evan pulls out what appears to be a decade old condom.

You balk.  You are drunk but not drunk enough to consider fucking without protection.  Being around Evan is already dangerous enough as it is in your new form.  “We aren’t using that,” you shut down Evan.

Instead of disappointment, Evan reacts in the opposite manner you expect. “You mean?  //Bareback!?//” Evan’s voice cracks with joy.

“No, you fucking moron!  I mean…”  //What DO I mean?  My head hurts...//

[[“I mean: go get another condom.”]]
[[“Fuck off, you ungrateful bastard.  I am going downstairs.”|Sleep on the couch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1034" name="“I mean: go get another condom.”" tags="" position="13246,17398" size="100,100">Evan doesn’t need to be told twice.  He dashes out into the hall.  You listen with a faint smile as Evan ransacks the bathroom in his quest to find a condom.

Evan returns a few minutes later with a look of despair.  “I couldn’t find one.”

You examine the one he left behind.  It is flatter than a quarter.  “Dude, this expired like nine years ago.  Who the fuck were you trying to have sex with nine years ago?”

“Any girl who would have me!  It just sort of… never worked out.  I kept it as a good luck charm though!  And look, here we are and my luck has changed.”

“Creep.”

“C’mon, Taylor, let’s bang!”

“No.”

“Awww…”  Evan examines your expression. You glare at him to reinforce your position.  “Fine.  I REALLY appreciate what you did for me earlier,” Evan adds while bowing his head.

[[“You fucking better have!”]]  You are reminded of the weird taste in your mouth.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1035" name="“You fucking better have!”" tags="" position="13098,17504" size="100,100">“Please, just do me one more favor.  Let me see your boobs so that I can die a happy man!”

Enduring Evan’s pestering seems a lot more annoying than just showing him.  You slide your shirt over your head.  Your clumsy fingers fumble with your bra clasp, soon revealing your perfect, perky breasts towards your friend.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytopless3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnnfgggh…”  Evan’s eyes bulge as he stares at your tits.  For a moment Evan looks like he is having a stroke but eventually he recovers.  “Wow.  Wow.  WOW!  Holy shit, Taylor… Thank you.  This is like the greatest night ever,” Evan says as he begins to stroke himself.

You are shocked to see Evan’s cock rapidly return to life.  Once erect, he begins masturbating a foot away from you while admiring your heaving chest.

“Evan…”

“It is okay.  I am almost… done… uhh…”

Evan suddenly moves closer to you, looming above your topless, vulnerable figure.  “Evan, what are you---? Eeep!” you squeak as Evan rubs against you.  Evan seems to have lost control, for he hooks his fingers into your pants and [[pulls them off in a single, swift motion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1036" name="pulls them off in a single, swift motion." tags="" position="13242,17542" size="100,100">You are now underneath Evan wearing nothing but a small pair of panties.  //If Evan finds out how wet I am… Ahhh...//  You can’t even finish the thought, for it disturbs you too much.

With a strong hand on your hip, Evan rolls you over.  Once on your stomach, he presses down between you shoulder blades, pushing you into a precarious position where you feel exposed and powerless.  

Evan grabs your ass.  As he he touches you, his hand brushes against your center.

You feel something hard press against your groin, its advance held back only by a thin layer of wet fabric and flesh.  //I REALLY hope that is just a finger...//

You struggle to crane your neck and look backwards.  You can sense the vague outline of Evan mounting you from behind.

[[Thankfully, he withdraws before penetrating you.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/goddamnitevan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uhhnnn!  This ass!  I can’t take it!” Evan howls as he ejaculates all over your panty clad butt.

Evan’s semen pools in the crack of your round bum.  Satisfied and exhausted, Evan falls over like a dead man.  A minute of panting later, Evan is sound asleep… leaving you with a sticky situation and a feeling of guilt.

//I almost had sex with Evan!  Yikes… I need to get my life in order.//

You feel too uncomfortable to sleep next to Evan with your soiled underwear.  You gather your clothes and head into the bathroom.  You strip off your panties and run scalding water over them before washing your face.  You put your panties in your pocket and decide to go sleep without underwear.

You then stumble downstairs and fall onto the couch.
[[Sleep on the couch]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1038" name="“I will settle for a blowjob,”" tags="" position="14731,8424" size="100,100">“That is still sex!”

“Not really…  C’mon, don’t leave me hanging here.  I can’t exactly focus on changing you back with this big distraction here.”

You gulp.  //Big distraction.//  That was an apt way to describe Damien’s bouncing cock.

Given Damien’s state of arousal, you doubt you will be able to escape without providing him some sort of service.  //Eww… am I really thinking about getting Damien off?  Fuck, yes I am...  But do I have any other choice?//  

You wipe the sweat off your burning forehead.  You fan your face desperately with a hand.  “Why do I feel like I just drank more of that green shit?” you huff.

“I might have mixed a little bit in with the yellow,” Damien casually admits.

You grit your teeth.  Your tiny hands ball into fists.  “Damien!  You //double-drugged// me?  How fucking dare you?  Guh!  Oh shit… I…don’t feel so good…”

//Oh my god!  I am fucking roasting!//  Your unfocused, spotty vision gradually returns.  You catch Damien’s eye.

Damien beckons you forth.  After a few seconds of angry internal monologue, you crawl towards him.

As you approach, the sour smell intensifies.  You stop a foot away and Damien pushes forward, rubbing his precum leaking penis all over your closed lips.  

[[“Just open up!  You can do it!”]] Damien encourages.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1039" name="“Just open up!  You can do it!”" tags="" position="14583,8479" size="100,100">//Fuck my life...//  You open your mouth to let Damien inside.  “Omm…”

You can barely fit the tip of his cock in your mouth.  You extend your tongue and taste the salty, bitter fluid that is already dripping from Damien’s manhood.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lsuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“My cock in your mouth is a great look for you!  Suck that dick, Taylor!  Heck yes!” Damien encourages you.

Although you hate yourself, you do your best to please Damien.  Lewd sucking sounds fill the room.  You slurp and lick away until Damien’s dick is shiny and slick, coated with your saliva.  Damien’s musk, the smell of sweat and the taste of cock eventually dominate your senses.

Despite your poor service, Damien isn’t able to last long.  [[You stay on your knees as Damien covers you with his jizz.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1040" name="You stay on your knees as Damien covers you with his jizz." tags="" position="14736,8573" size="100,100">“Uhhhhhhhh!  Oh yeah!” Damien groans as he jerks off, expediting the explosion of cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lfacial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After a disturbingly vivid thirty seconds of watching Damien ejaculate, Damien’s stinky cum drips down your face.  Damien  isn’t finished though.  He rubs his dick against your face and milks his cock until every drop of semen is squeezed onto your youthful, innocent face.  You feel used; marked like a possession.

//I can’t believe this happened… again...//

With Damien momentarily satisfied, you use the opportunity to flee from Damien’s room [[before your own green and yellow potion infused desires seize hold of you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1041" name="before your own green and yellow potion infused desires seize hold of you." tags="" position="14579,8626" size="100,100">After your ordeal is over, you retreat to the shower and scrub your pale flesh until it is red and stinging.  Despite a half hour being pelted with hot water, you step out feeling unclean.  Damien has sullied you again.  

“I look like an innocent little angel… and the first thing that pervert does is defile me!” you complain to your reflection as you step out of the shower.

You notice a towel and some folded fabric near the doorway.  //Did Damien drop this off while I was in the shower?  I am kind of amazed he didn’t try and join me...//  “Thank fuck he didn’t.  I would have shoved a shampoo bottle up his ass.”  You pick up and inspect an incredibly tiny pair of panties.  “Where the hell did he get these anyway?  Why the fuck would he have such small panties on hand?”  //Errr… I probably don’t want to know the answer to that...//

You regret your choice to stay with Damien.  He seems very pleased with your latest transformation.  On the other hand, you //hate// your new form.  It is obviously frail and weak and you suspect it would be difficult to get people to take you seriously while you look so immature.

//I have to get out of here before I become trapped!  But even if I do… how am I going to return to normal?//

After you change, [[you follow the direction of your rumbling stomach to the kitchen.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1042" name="you follow the direction of your rumbling stomach to the kitchen." tags="" position="14736,8735" size="100,100">You help yourself to Damien’s fridge and begin to make a sandwich.  After confirming Damien is still in the basement, you sit down for lunch.

You eat half the sandwich and feel stuffed.  “No…  This… is awful…  My stomach has shrunk too.  I love food!  Now I can barely eat!  Noooooooooooo!” you wail as you rub your swollen belly.

“What’s wrong with you?” Damien interrupts you.

His sudden appearance startles you.

“You scared me!”

“Sorry…  How are you feeling?”

“Uhh…”  You rub your legs together.  You are reminded of the strange yearning still percolating inside you.  The green potion is still clearly in effect.  Given your small size, it might even last for longer than your previous use.  “I am fine…”

“Are you going to eat that?” Damien points at the half sandwich.

“I can’t!  Because of //you!//” you rage as you stand up and storm off into the living room.  Damien doesn’t even wait until you are gone before he grabs the food and devours it in three large bites.

You turn on the TV and try and occupy your mind.  Halfway through a funny cartoon show, Damien sits beside you.

You give him a dirty look and shimmy to the edge of the couch.  An hour later, Damien has already inched his way towards you to the point that [[your legs are now touching.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1043" name="your legs are now touching." tags="" position="14583,8779" size="100,100">You scowl at Damien.  “Can you not sit so fucking close to me?”

“But you’re so cute… I just want to tease you.”

“You know, you are probably an even bigger creep than Evan.”

Damien raises an eyebrow.  “Definitely.  That guy is an amateur.”

“You seem pleased with yourself.  That isn’t something to be proud of.”

The spot where your legs are touching has become sweaty and hot.  You try and move away but discover you have long since run out of room.

“Ahh!  What are you doing!?” you yelp as Damien begins tickling the soles of your bare feet.  “Ahh ha!  Stop iiiit!” you cry as you flail around and attempt to escape.  

[[“I knew you were ticklish!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1044" name="“I knew you were ticklish!”" tags="" position="14739,8877" size="100,100">“Stooooop!  Ahhhhhhhh!  Ah ha ha ha….”  Damien wraps you in his arms.  You are trapped.  Damien’s nimble fingers tickle your neck, ankles, and armpits before teasing the soft flesh of your belly and thighs.  Damien continues toying with you, his huge hands coaxing giggles and involuntary shudders from you. 

You struggle against Damien’s enveloping arms until you manage to squirm away.  You kick Damien in the chest but he doesn’t even seem to register the blow.

Damien seems to have lost his mind.  He is clearly living out some pervy fantasy.  //Why the fuck does it have to be with me!?//

“Get away from me!” you screech as you run into the bathroom and splash some water onto your face.  When you return to the kitchen, Damien has two frosty glasses of fruit punch on the table.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/punch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[“That is definitely what I need to cool down.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1045" name="“That is definitely what I need to cool down.”" tags="" position="14587,8932" size="100,100">Damien grins at you.  “I made you one,” he says with a gesture at the closest glass.

“Hah!  I am not an idiot, Damien.”  You walk over to Damien and swap the cups, stealing Damien’s beverage.

You drink deeply.  The delicious tropical cocktail makes you immediately feel reinvigorated. 

Damien frowns at the glass in front of him.  “Did you think I spiked it?”

“Sounds like the kind of shit you would do.  I would say our trust level is close to zero.”

Damien grabs the glass in front of him and downs it in a few big gulps.  “Ahhh.  Yum.”

“I guess it wasn’t spiked,” you observe with a shrug.  You follow Damien’s example and swallow the rest of your punch.

Damien leans forward and gives you a toothy grin.  “No,” he says, “but the one you just drank was.”

“Huh!?  What the fuck!?  //You spiked your own drink!?//  What is wrong with you?”  //He knew I would switch them?  How in the fuck-- what a manipulative cunt!//  Damien has clearly read you like a book.

Damien begins laughing, his mirth expanding until he is slapping the table.

“You’re bluffing!”  You pray Damien is lying but his reaction and the growing warmth inside you makes you certain your old friend [[has again gotten the better of you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1046" name="has again gotten the better of you." tags="" position="14735,9025" size="100,100">You retreat to the living room and Damien follows you.  He sits down on the couch and you sit on the opposite side of the room.

“Taylor, come here please.”  Damien pats his lap.  You look at Damien and shake your head.  Your brain screams “no” but your aphrodisiac infused body has other ideas.  Your whole body is now tingling… with a pronounced yearning emanating from your groin.  Instead of an erection, you now possess an indistinct, feminine desire.  

The green potion’s effects seem to increase by the second until you fear you will spend the next week mindlessly masturbating.  //I can’t do that… Hnnn…  Damien’s already here….//

“You can never tell anyone about this,” you finally say to Damien.

“My lips are sealed.  Now hop on daddy’s lap.”

“You’re //not// my daddy.”

“Not yet,” Damien replies.

Flushing with embarrassment, you take a seat on Damien’s lap.  He places his hands on your waist and effortlessly repositions you over top of his throbbing erection.  //What the hell?  Damien’s dick is pressing into my butt… // You cannot help but feel mortified yet also undeniably aroused.  You can see a damp spot forming [[on the front of your panties.]]  //This is so wrong...//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1047" name="on the front of your panties." tags="" position="14578,9079" size="100,100">“Ugghh!” you moan in surprise and Damien begins to caress a sensual line down your pubis, rubbing both sides of your inner thighs before moving on to fondle your delicate center.  Damien rubs the sodden fabric into your crevice.

//Oh my god,// you think as your mind goes blank as Damien’s practiced fingers coax a tingling warm sensation from between your legs.  //No, not just warmth,// you realize, //wetness…//  Damien begins stirring his fingers into your sopping pussy.  

Damien realizes it too.  He chuckles as he slides his fingers under your panties and pulls them up back into view so that you can see your glistening secretions on his fingertips.

“Uhhh…”

He slides off your panties and you don’t protest.  It was pointless to fight back against Damien.  You feel like a child next to an adult.

Damien inspects your pussy.  You can feel his hot breath on your labia.  “Ohh wow… that looks awesome!  A little bit of gold hair by your pussy…  Now you can’t object!  Remember that old adage about “grass on the field?””

“I hate you so much,” you murmur absently.  You try and think about anything except how horny you feel.  It is difficult to deny the growing, [[bubbly warmth that is surging up inside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1048" name="bubbly warmth that is surging up inside you." tags="" position="14729,9180" size="100,100">You zone out for a moment, lost in the strange sensations surging throughout your new body.

The next thing you know, Damien is down to his underwear.  A second later, he loses that as well.

Damien’s penis flops out and grinds against your pussy.  For a moment, you are disoriented and can only look at your two slender legs and the massive cock that is standing erect between them.  From this vantage it almost looks like it belongs to you.  Your flat chest and youthful features kind of make you look like a little boy with a humongous dick.  It would be almost funny if it wasn’t so absurd, fucked up, and //scary.//  //If that monster cock goes inside me…// there is little doubt you would end up in a hospital with internal bleeding.  //I might even die...//  Yet some things were worth dying for.  //I am so fucking horny!  I am going insane!//

It horrifies you that a small part of you //wants// Damien to continue.  //I really hope that is just the green potion!  Of course it is!  It is all that potion… It is just too potent….//

As you look at Damien’s long, thick, and very veiny penis you mentally appraise him at eight inches.  //His dick is almost bigger than my fucking forearm!// you fret.

Where your pussy meets Damien’s manhood feels incredibly hot.  You can see the midpoint of his shaft is stained from your [[wetness where you have been rubbing against him.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1049" name="wetness where you have been rubbing against him." tags="" position="14580,9235" size="100,100">Fearing for your dignity (or what little remains of it), you decide a preemptive assault might be beneficial!

You wrap your hand around Damien’s shaft.  You are taken aback by its heat and hardness and also how your slender fingers barely close around its meaty girth.  Damien truly does have a glorious dick.  You stare at it with a feeling of envy.

//There is no reason to be jealous now,// you chide yourself with embarrassment.

You begin to jerk off the cock jutting between your legs as if it were your own.  Your tiny hand glides up and down its length, coaxing moans of pleasure from Damien and ample precum from his glans until your hands are well lubricated and lewd sounds [[are sent echoing throughout the room.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1050" name="Evan greets you first." tags="" position="10247,27186" size="100,100">“Hey, Taylor!” Evan shouts as he rushes over to you.  “Yikes, what happened?  Long night?” he asks you after notes your bedraggled appearance.

You rub at your eyes.  “Nothing!  I just have been kind of mixed up lately,” you respond.  “Even more than usual.”

“Do you wanna hang out tonight?  I got us some--”

“Sorry Evan,” you interrupt.  “I already have plans with Drew.”

Evan scowls.  “Why are you spending so much time with that loser?”

You shrug and a raise an eyebrow.  “Because he is my friend.”

“Well what about me!?  Aren’t //I// your friend too?  You haven’t even let me motorboat you once since you got those boobs!”

“Man, Evan, you are such an asshole sometimes.  Drew has just been having some trouble and he has been helping me with mine.  Drew needs my help….far more than your stupid near-constant need to be a creep.  We will talk later!”

“Wait a second!” Evan shouts.  Evan appears concerned.  He leans in close to you and whispers in your ear.  “What’s up with you and Drew?  You two have been weird lately.  Well, Drew is always weird, but the last couple weeks [[both of you have been on a whole new level.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1051" name="both of you have been on a whole new level.”" tags="" position="10397,27247" size="100,100">It is hard enough to organize and understand your own thoughts, let alone explain to Evan what is going on.

Evan studies your reaction.  “Taylor, did Drew like //do// something to you?  Wait a sec!  Does this have something to do with Drew being sent to the hospital?  What the hell happened, man?  Is Drew like guilting you into doing something perverted?”  Evan peppers you with questions.

“What!?  No!  It is just…  Fuck, man… there are //weird// people following me.  One of them beat up Drew,” you explain.

Evan is amazed… and angry.  “What the fuck!?” he explodes, drawing the attention of most of the other students.  “You are in danger and you ask that dweeb for help?  Drew would lose in a fight against a fucking kitten.  Why didn’t you tell me?”

“I didn’t tell you //because// it is dangerous.  Drew got involved by accident.  I didn’t want to draw either of you into whatever shitstorm I have stumbled into.”

“So?  Man, if you need help, just ask and I am there.”

“Evan, it isn’t that I don’t appreciate your offer because I do--thank you!  But this isn’t like helping me move a couch or something.  The truth is that things are //mega fucked up//.  There are violent people after me!  Whatever caused my transformation is bad news and has drawn the attention of I… don’t even know what!  Rogue billionaires?  Government organizations?  Multi-billion dollar companies?  All of the above?  Dude, I am fucked!  Believe me, if I thought you could help me navigate this shitstorm even an inch forward I would ask for your help.  But things as they are… it is probably best you keep your distance.  [[If someone asks questions about me tell them you have never fuckin’ heard of me.”]]

“I will get this sorted out.  Don’t worry!” you reply, trying to sound upbeat.

Drew arrives uncharacteristically late, perhaps as a conversation avoidance strategy.  The three of you enter class without another word.

Mr. Deter lectures about old fashioned psychological techniques.

You walk away from the class with brutal images of ice-pick lobotomies and electroshock therapy etched into your mind.

You notice Evan and Drew standing nearby talking to each other.  Evan says something to Drew and he walks away looking ashen faced.

You head to your next class and learn fascinating facts about pottery… and communism.  

“Meet me by the benches after class,” you [[text Drew after your class is finished.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1053" name="text Drew after your class is finished." tags="" position="10388,27397" size="100,100">Drew arrives after his final class finishes.  He slows as he approaches you as if you give off an aura of repulsion.

Drew comes to a stop a few feet away.  He seems exceptionally nervous.  You stare at him.  It takes obvious effort for Drew to meet your gaze.

“H-Hey, Taylor!” Drew greets you.  His voice cracks when he says your name.

“Hi, Drew!  We didn’t get to talk this morning.”

“I know.... I am really sorry.  I already know what you are going to say!”

You raise an eyebrow.  “Oh?”  //Even I don’t know what the fuck I am going to say...//  “Drew, I have been doing a lot of thinking…”

“Aww… That’s what I thought.”  Drew takes a deep breath.  “Taylor!  It’s okay.  I know you don’t want to go out with me.  You don’t have to.”

[[Agree to go on a date with Drew]]

Drew looks confused.  “You mean…?”

“Yes, Drew.  I will go out with you on a date,” you confirm.

Drew’s mouth drops open in surprise.  It was clear he thought you would refuse his request.  “REALLY?  That is… //amazing//,” he remarks.  “You’re the best, Taylor!”

“Hey!  Don’t get too excited.  We are just going to do one.  Make it count.”

“That’s enough, Taylor!  And more than I was hoping for.  Thank you for this opportunity!”  //Opportunity?//  Drew seems giddy and light on his feet, almost like he is about to break into dance at any second.  //Geez… it is just a date…  And it isn’t like I am much of a catch…  I am like an extra weird transformative tranny...//  You fight off a sudden shiver.  //And now I am going to go out on a date with my best friend...//  

//Well, since I already agreed to this...//  “So, Drew… what do you want to do?”

“//R-right now!?//” [[Drew stammers in alarm.]]

We are both free right now.”  You look up at the cloudless sky.  “It is a nice night.”  //We might as well get this over with.  Quick and painless - just like a bandaid!  And Drew may have a permanent +10 added to his happiness score.//  The more you think about it, the more you firmly you believe that going out on a date with Drew is inconsequential considering how much time the two of you have already spent together over the years.

Drew takes a few deep breaths and seems to calm himself.  “I have a couple ideas,” he begins.  “For starters, there is a fair in town!  How cool would that be?  They even have a ferris wheel!”

“Wow!  A giant, deadly contraption that looks like it is made to please rodents.  And if it breaks loose it becomes a wheel of death!”

“Oh.  I always thought of them as… romantic.”

You shake your head at Drew and can’t help but laugh.

“Well, we could always just have a big marathon game night too.  I have a few titles I haven&#39;t even tried yet.  There is that new //Space Citizen// game that looks crazy.  They made an entire universe and it has seven hundred hand crafted shuips and a FPS mode.”

“Oh.  That could be fun!”  //But isn’t that we always do?  Would it really be different with a date atmosphere?//  You gulp.  //Yes, it probably would be fucking weird… but maybe doing something “safe” like just hanging out would be best for both our nerves.//

“I also found out something interesting.  It might sound a little weird, especially coming from me, but hear me out.  [[So there is this abandoned hospital…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1057" name="So there is this abandoned hospital…”" tags="" position="10249,27635" size="100,100">“Did you say //“abandoned hospital”?//” you can’t help but interrupt.  “Seriously?  What the fuck, Drew?  That sounds like the plot for an awful horror movie… or a bad game.  I thought you wanted to go out on a //date//.”  You think about Drew’s latest offer for a moment and find it to be surprisingly palatable.  “It actually isn’t that bad of an idea,” you muse.  “I am always game for a little adventure.  It actually might be pretty fun… kinda like a haunted house or something.  You know I love those post apocalyptic games too!”  

Drew pulls up a picture on his phone.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hospbuild.jpg&quot;&gt;
“That place looks like it is right out of //Quiet Hill//!” you remark.  “Spooky.”

“Yeah.  It gives me the creeps.  I start to think of all the people that died within those walls and how they--”

“Whoa!  That’s enough, Drew.  Are you sure about this?”

Drew nods.  [[“If you want to go, then I do too.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1058" name="“If you want to go, then I do too.”" tags="" position="10397,27697" size="100,100">You grin at Drew.  Still, it seems odd that Drew would suggest such an idea in the first place, as he always disliked horror games and movies.

“Is it even possible to get inside this place?”

“I think so.  The city is pretty cheap in general and I can see the same applying to their security.  I think we will be able to get in if we wait for long enough.”

“Okay.  Interesting choice!  But the next obvious question is: why is it closed down?  It isn’t //haunted// or anything, is it?”

“Well, part of the reason I suggested it is because Trans Corp used to own it as a private hospital through its medical operations wing.  I know we probably won&#39;t find anything but I thought there was a chance.”  Drew sighs.  “Sorry… I didn’t want to get your hopes up.”

“That’s really thoughtful…  I am sure we will have a good time no matter what we do.”

You decide to...

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1059" name="Cut through the park" tags="" position="3642,2090" size="100,100">You decide it would be quicker to cut through the park.  You shamble through the paths as quickly as you can without breaking into a run but soon find the pace unsustainable.

You try and tough it out for as long as you can.  One moment you feel like your skin is burning, the next you feel like you are about to shit your pants.

You glance over at the edge of the park and spot a public restroom just as the boiling in your guts reaches critical levels.

Your mind furiously calculates the distance and compares it with your walk home.  &quot;Fuck!  Ohhh…. I am not going to make it....&quot;  You begin to stumble towards the toilets with a feeling of terror.

You barely get your pants off in time and sit in agony as you do your business.  Even once you are completely cleaned out, you still feel ill.

As you pull off the last square of toilet paper from a nearby roll, you do a double take as your action reveals a secret message scrawled in purple crayon.

You stare at the tp roll incredulously.

&quot;Taylor, if you need help, go to the storage shed,&quot; it reads.

&quot;What the fuck?&quot;  //Is this some kind of elaborate practical joke?  They know where I am.  They know my name...  And poisoned me!? Or at least gave me laxatives...//  &quot;What the fuck!?&quot; you repeat, holding your still gurgling stomach.  &quot;Why would someone do this?&quot; you wail as you chuck the tp roll message into the garbage.

Your anger overwhelms your good sense.  When you turn the corner you are shocked to see an unfamiliar young woman instead of one of your stupid friends.

The stunningly beautiful brunette waves you over with a delicate hand.  She smirks at you as you approach.

&quot;Sup,&quot; she greets you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorrouxf.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Whoa…&quot;  Your breath catches in your throat as you get a close look at the woman.  She is barefoot and bright-eyed.  She is wearing gold hoop earrings.  Her dark blue dress frames her perky breasts in a way that you can&#39;t help but stare.

&quot;Yeah, I know.  I am fuckin&#39; mesmerizing,&quot; [[the girl remarks with a laugh.]]

Who the hell are you?  Did you give me laxatives or something?  Who put you up to this?&quot; you shout out your questions.

The brunette looks annoyed.  &quot;First of all, yeah, I am full of myself because I am fucking awesome.  I&#39;ll answer your questions in reverse.  No one put me up to this.  And, no, I didn&#39;t give you laxatives-- you are in for a lot of bullshit but it isn&#39;t going to be coming out of your ass,&quot; the young woman jokes.

There is something vaguely familiar in the way the woman speaks. You can&#39;t quite put your finger on it.  //She almost sounds like a caricature of...//

&quot;Wait a second…  You look //really// familiar…&quot; //No, I&#39;ve never seen this chick before! It has to be my imagination!//

&quot;Ahhh… I am … //dying//…&quot;

&quot;Hah, you wish.  Man up!&quot;

The woman&#39;s words are hard to understand.  You feel like your spirit is rising up over your dead body.

The woman grabs you by your collar.  &quot;No, don&#39;t touch me…&quot; you protest in vain as her warm hands caress your flesh.  With surprising gentleness, the woman touches your neck and whispers into your ear.

&quot;The winds of fourteen corners shall make the mountains rise,&quot; she purrs.

&quot;Aghhh!  Gaahh!&quot;  You choke and sputter.  Suddenly you can breathe and think again.  [[All your previous pain has vanished.]]

You open your mouth to argue but think better of it.  //So, what?  This nutty chick is claiming to be… my fucking clone?//  &quot;What&#39;s my favorite game then?&quot;

&quot;Erotic or non?&quot;

You squint at her and decide to test the woman&#39;s resolve.  &quot;Erotic.&quot;

The woman grins wickedly.  &quot;Are you sure you want me to LOUDLY MENTION THAT YOU ENJOY DATING SIMS WITH CUTE LITTLE HIGHSC--&quot;

&quot;WAIT!  Stop it!  That&#39;s enough!&quot; you interrupt.  You aren&#39;t sure what to make of your situation or this mysterious young woman.  //Maybe she is a hacker....// you guess, still unwilling to believe &quot;Taylor&#39;s&quot; story.

The female Taylor gives you a dirty look.  &quot;I just saved your life,&quot; Taylor replies evenly.  Her dark, penetrating eyes stare you down, an eerie mirror image of your own.  The woman clearly possesses the same intimidating nature as your sister.

&quot;For all I know you fucking poisoned me and then gave me the antidote!&quot; you object.  &quot;That is a way more likely than whatever the fuck //this// is!&quot;  You gesture angrily at the woman, your stomach, and the park.  &quot;You&#39;re obviously some kind of //trickster!//&quot; you yell, morphing the last word from &quot;scammer&quot; at the last moment.

The strangely alluring woman giggles.  [[&quot;That is probably not far off the mark!&quot;]]

She seems to be taking this role quite seriously.  I wonder how far she will go before she breaks character and admits this is all a fucking sham?  Alright, bitch!  You&#39;re mine!//  

You grin at &quot;Taylor&quot; as you get an idea.  &quot;Okay then.  Since we are both the same person…  And you are from the future or whatever, that means you //have seen me naked.//&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; she responds with a yawn.  &quot;You&#39;re below average too, by the way,&quot; Taylor says as she leans back and crosses her long legs.  Your eyes are drawn to her shapely limbs.  You find yourself imagining what it would be like to pry those pale thighs apart and see for yourself what&#39;s under that dress.

//What the hell is wrong with me?// you silently wonder as you become conscious of how profusely you are sweating.  As your eyes sweep over Taylor&#39;s chest, you feel a tightness in your own…[[and in your pants.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1066" name="you get a phone call." tags="" position="10390,26837" size="100,100">“Hello!” you answer.

“This is Fantasia.  You’re still alive I take it, Mr. Roux?”

“Yep; no incidents to report!”

“I see.  That’s a shame.”  Bloom seems a tad displeased you have survived without her protection.  “I have completed my first round of analyses,” Dr. Bloom informs you.

You literally jump for joy.  “Yes!  That’s great!  Thank you so much!  What did you find out?”

“A lot of things… mostly technical minutiae that I won’t bore you with but I have learned much of importance.  It is clear reverse engineering this technology will be lucrative, so I appreciate you sharing with me.  I now understand the principles by which these strange nanomachines operate but I haven’t discovered a suitable explanation for the source of their power.  Every question I answer seems to spawn another in its place.”

You feel a portion of your confidence disappear.  [[“How long is that going to take?”]]  You can’t help but let a worried tone coat your words.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1067" name="“How long is that going to take?”" tags="" position="10242,26889" size="100,100">Dr. Bloom sighs.  “Science is like art.  It doesn’t get produced on a schedule.  To complete my second round of tests will take at least a month.  I have already got the machines to respond to certain signals.  It is only a matter of time and experimentation before they will offer up all their secrets to me.  But it could easily take a year or perhaps even several to unlock a suitable reaction.  I am only a single multi-billionaire with near limitless resources.”

You feel like you are on an emotional rollercoaster.  “Wait… that sounds really great actually!”

“And why should I devote all of those resources to you?” Fantasia bluntly asks you.

Dr. Bloom appears to playing hard to get.  After a brief pause to consider your options, you reply:
[[“Because I gave you the tech freely and you are obviously a person of honor, unlike Elon Smell.”]]
[[“I think you know why.”]]
[[“For the benefits!”]]

Fair enough,” she replies.  The Doctor seems impressed.  “I will call you once my supercomputer has spit out some command signals to test.  Have a good night!  And watch out for men in black!” Bloom teases you as she hangs up.

You resume walking to school with a spring in your step.  //Hopefully this is my last month as a girl...//  “If I want to help Drew out and maybe have some fun like this my time is limited.”  You had been so caught up in the madness of your transformation that you had not stopped to enjoy it.  “Taylor, wake up and smell the roses!”  You feel liberated.

When you arrive at school, you spot Evan outside Deter’s lecture hall.  [[Evan greets you first.]]

“Good idea.  It will be extra spooky and easier to get by any security.  How about we get some dinner first?” you suggest.

At the mention of food, [[Drew’s face brightens.]]

“The wheel has spoken!” you intone.  “Looks like we are eating Chinese food.”

“Alright!  I love Chinese!” 

You roll your eyes.  “Name a type you //don’t// like.”

Drew shakes his head.  He looks absolutely mystified.  “Every culture has their great foods!”

[[Go to the Chinese restaurant with Drew]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1075" name="Go to the Chinese restaurant with Drew" tags="" position="10244,28081" size="100,100">A fifteen minute walk later, you are standing in front of a colorful looking Chinese restaurant.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chineseout.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Wow this place looks cool!” you comment.

“Their cooking is even better,” Drew opines just as three asian men walk by carrying greasy boxes labelled “MSG” in black ink.

“Did you just see that!?”

“What?  Oh, the fresh stock!  Yeah, I know… makes my mouth water.  Mmmm!  [[Let’s hurry inside.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1076" name="Let’s hurry inside.”" tags="" position="10392,28143" size="100,100">You follow the three men inside.  You are pleasantly surprised the five star rating appears to hold true.  The interior decor is equally impressive.  //Let’s hope that holds true for their food...//  

For some reason the hostess seems to be acquainted with Drew.  “Duhrewwwwwwww!” she wails as she dashes forth and throws herself into Drew’s arms.

Drew hugs her while they exchange pleasantries before graciously whisking you away to a secluded table.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chinesein.jpg&quot;&gt;
“You seem popular,” you say to Drew as you sit down.  

“Oh… uh… I have been here before,” Drew admits.

[[“Obviously…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1077" name="“Obviously…”" tags="" position="10236,28245" size="100,100">The pleasant smells of fresh cooking make you salivate as you flip through a fairly thick menu.  Every dish sounds tasty but you eventually make your choice.  You order a sweet and spicy chicken dish named after a famous Chinese general.

A suspiciously short time later, your food arrives.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chinesefood.jpg&quot;&gt;
Drew seems impressed with your choice.  He steals a piece of chicken from your plate and begins to regale you with [[an almost encyclopedia like level of recall.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1078" name="an almost encyclopedia like level of recall." tags="" position="10396,28299" size="100,100">“General Tso was instrumental in crushing the Taiping rebellion…” Drew begins to ramble.  You marvel simultaneously at how pointless the information seems while being impressed with Drew’s memory and breadth of knowledge.

You let Drew lecture for a bit before interrupting, “AND he made good fuckin’ chicken.  What a great guy!”

“Well, actually, the dish was created long after Tso died by an American chef borrowing an idea from Hunan…” Drew informs you.

“That sucks.  The General didn’t even get to try his own chicken!” you lament.  You spear another sauce covered chicken nugget and plow it into a field of rice before devouring it.  The sweet and spicy flavors do battle on your tongue.  “Mmmm… he really missed out!”

“Hm…  The communists looted his tomb and destroyed all the historical artifacts.  Then they threw the General’s body into a bog just about the time this chicken dish was invented.”

You stop eating, the food halfway to your mouth.  “That is pretty grim…  See, this is why I hope ghosts do exist.  Those assholes deserve to be haunted.  What a bunch of fucking dicks trying to destroy history and replace it with their own bullshit.”

Drew takes out his cellphone.  [[“Oh, did you see this?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1079" name="“Oh, did you see this?”" tags="" position="10244,28397" size="100,100">Drew taps at his phone for a few seconds and then turns it towards you.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bonepile.jpg&quot;&gt;
On screen is a picture of a sandy hill with what appears to be a lot of sun bleached wood.  //Wait, that isn&#39;t wood...//

“What am I looking at?  Are those what I think they are?”

“See that huge hill?”

“Of course.”

“It is made out of //mummies,//” Drew explains.

His words send a shiver down your spine.  For a second you think Drew is joking, but as you look closer you can see that Drew is in fact correct.  All over the hill you can see scattered white bones and rags.  //There must be hundreds of them...//  The action seems so shockingly cold and disrespectful it genuinely outrages you.

“What the actual fuck!?” you explode.  An elderly chinese man sitting nearby glares at you.

“After the Arab Spring there was no police so desperate people looted all the museums and tombs,” Drew explains.  “They are digging up all the historic sites and wrecking everything.  They looted the tombs and then ripped apart all the mummies to find jewelry, then just tossed them in a big heap for the dogs.”

Your ancestors were not Egyptian but the information makes your blood boil nonetheless.  “That really pisses me off!  All those looters //deserve to be cursed and haunted!//”

[[Drew attempts to change the topic.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1080" name="Drew attempts to change the topic." tags="" position="10396,28443" size="100,100">“Speaking of haunted… are you sure about, you know, breaking into a hospital?”

“Yeah, well, I think I am more likely to break into a hospital than you are.  Besides, we are just “entering;” we won’t break anything.  We are just going to take a little peak!  We won’t take any mysterious artifacts or do anything that would warrant a haunting,” you add.

“Several of the ancient curses in the Valley of the Kings are said to be activated merely by entering the tomb,” Drew informs you.

“Well it is a hospital, not a tomb,” you correct Drew.  //Although a lot of people probably died excruciating deaths there… err…  I guess that is true of all hospitals... //  “Besides, I didn’t think you believed in ghosts.”

“Of course I don’t!  Ghosts do not exist,” Drew confidently asserts as his logical mind overrules his fear.

Drew orders a surprisingly large bottle of Chinese beer that the two of you split [[as you enjoy the remainder of your dinner.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1081" name="as you enjoy the remainder of your dinner." tags="" position="10249,28549" size="100,100">At about eight o&#39;clock the two of you exit the restaurant and head for the hospital.  You feel a bit bloated and are grateful for the exercise.  Drew seems less enthused but matches your pace.  You watch Drew out of the corner of your eye.  //Was he always so fast?//

//It isn’t him.  It is these damn small legs… I have to make so many extra steps!//

“You okay, Taylor?” Drew asks you.  “You have been quiet.”

His words snap you out of your weird thought spiral.  “Yep!  Just lots on my mind lately.  Bloom called me earlier.  She said she will probably have something for me in a month or so.”

“That’s great news!” Drew responds.  He does indeed sound happy but his words are clearly tainted with a sad undertone.

“So, let’s have fun and enjoy our “date.”  It is a beautiful night.”

Drew grins at you, seemingly content to be at your side.

You enter a street of shops.  You and Drew take your time and [[window shop along the way.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1082" name="window shop along the way." tags="" position="10397,28599" size="100,100">You stop in front of a storefront with women’s clothes modeled on manikins.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/windowshop.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Do you think I would look good in yellow?” you ask Drew.

Drew turns to you and says deadpan, “You would look good in anything.”

His somewhat cheesy line would normally have made you cringe, but the seriousness upon which he delivers the statement renders you unable to think of a suitable reply.

“HEY!  HEY!” interrupts a man homeless sitting nearby.  “Can you two help me?  I am DYyyyyYYYyyING!” he wails as he leans back against the building and starts shaking.

After a brief moment of consideration, [[Drew begins to move towards the homeless man.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1083" name="Drew begins to move towards the homeless man." tags="" position="10245,28701" size="100,100">“Be careful!” you whisper.  //I am all for helping the homeless but some of these guys are super shady!//  You are suddenly quite glad that you have Drew with you.  You know you wouldn’t feel completely safe alone.

Your warning does not stop Drew.  He kneels down next to the homeless man.  “What’s wrong?  Are you okay?” he asks the distraught man.

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!   Ahhhh!  I am STARVING!  Starvin’ tah death!” the man yells while clutching at his belly.

You note the man’s somewhat emaciated figure.  “He does look kind of hungry,” you say when you join Drew.

“Yeah!  Please help me before I just die here on the street!  My stomach is dissolving itself!  I feel… really… not… good,” the homeless explains his condition.  He looks like he is going to pass out at any moment.  “Just like… twenty bucks… maybe thirty bucks… that would save me!” he says, making a somewhat passive request.

You look at Drew and study his concerned, round face.  Drew has always been a compassionate guy.  He has already spent more time on this guy than you would have under most conditions.  You feel a bit guilty.  //Maybe I should carry more change or something...//  You begin to reflect how debit cards have kind of screwed a lot of panhandlers.

[[“I will help you!” Drew declares.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1084" name="“I will help you!” Drew declares." tags="" position="10397,28747" size="100,100">“Bless you, son!” beams the old man.  He grins and holds out his hand.  Drew leaves the man hanging.  He spins on his heel and walks into a nearby shop.

You follow and watch Drew fill a small grocery basket with various foodstuffs along with some prepared food items like a giant sandwich.  He rings up over thirty dollars worth of food and carries it outside.  You smile in approval as Drew sets a hefty bag of groceries in front of the starving homeless man.

The homeless man gapes at the food and then at Drew.  You expect him to shower Drew with praise but you witness a surprising reaction.  “You fucking dumb mother fucking asshole!  What the f-f-fuck am I supposed to do with this shit!?” he screams at Drew.  The man&#39;s demeanor transforms from friendly to hostile in an instant.

You and Drew are equally stunned.  “You… eat it?” a confused Drew suggests.  “I got you a big sandwich!”

The homeless man grimaces.  “Why couldn’t you just give me the fucking money, you stupid tub of lard!?” the man shouts as he throws the bag of groceries out onto the street.  You hear a glass item break.

“What the hell?  Hey, you said you were //starving!//” you object. 

“I am!  Just not for this!  My dealer doesn’t accept “big fuckin’ sandwiches!”  Get the fuck out of here!  You damned morons are scaring off my customers,” the homeless man replies through gritted teeth.  

A part of you wants to purge this community of this particular member of its underclass, but you think better of your actions.  “C’mon Drew, let’s go.  You are just wasting your kindness with this one.”

You pick up the grocery bag and leave.  You walk another block and finally spot your destination looming in the distance.

“Spooky hospital sighted,” you say to Drew [[as you marvel at the size of the derelict building.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1085" name="as you marvel at the size of the derelict building." tags="" position="10249,28845" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hospbuild.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Whoa this place is huge!” you comment.  “It will take ages to explore.”

Drew gives you a nervous smile.  “Yep-if we can make it inside.  Let’s find a spot to wait until night.  A concealed entry will increase our chances of success,” he sagely adds.

As the last of the daylight illuminates the structure, you and Drew find a spot on a nearby hill to wait.

The two of you sit down on the grass.  Drew opens the leaking grocery bag that you took turns carrying and hands you a bottle of juice.

You twist off the cap and take a sip.  “Ahh, delicious!  That skinny guy doesn’t know what he was missing.”

Drew stares off into the distance.  “I feel sorry for him,” [[he admits.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1086" name="and in your pants." tags="" position="3511,2738" size="100,100">You turn away to hide your boner and take a deep breath to calm yourself.  As you inhale a strange cherry fragrance, you feel your disposition shift in the opposite direction.  Your mouth becomes a desert while your vision swims.

You look at the woman claiming to be you and feel emotions far beyond anger.  You suddenly desire this beautiful woman and find her more attractive than any other you have set your eyes on.  //She makes Sam look fucking plain…//  You take another breath, inhaling deeply through your nose.  You revel in the refreshing park air and that delightful undertone of black cherries, it&#39;s so sweet you can almost //taste// the breeze.  //No, that isn&#39;t true… Sam is the best!// you argue with yourself.  You take another look at the seductress in front of you and your mind goes almost completely blank.  //Yes, it is true...//

You have never been more captivated by someone in your life.  You start to pant and flush with warmth and embarrassment.  You feel your heart thundering in your chest, pumping blood to your crotch until your raging erection is all you are conscious of.  You now desire this strange [[woman more than anything else.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1087" name="woman more than anything else." tags="" position="3361,2792" size="100,100">//If she is going to fuck with me then I will definitely fuck with her!//   You decide to play dirty.

&quot;I want to see you naked!&quot; you shout when your good sense finally capitulates to lust.

The girl tilts her head sideways and raises an eyebrow.  After a few seconds she begins laughing uproariously.  &quot;I see.  At least you’re honest.&quot;

Your embarrassment gets pushed to the back burner when you realize the girl seems to be up for it.

You decide to press your advantage.  &quot;Fair is fair, right?  If you show me, I would //almost// believe your story.”    //Alright… now she will show her true colors!  This babe is going to crumble like a Chinese skyscraper!//

&quot;Alright.  Follow me,&quot; Taylor answers without missing a beat.  She begins walking towards the rear of the storage sheds.  You are completely floored.  //Is she for real?// you silently wonder.  You follow after her a second later.

Just as you catch up to Taylor, she kicks over a decorative flower pot and steals the contents.  She holds the flowers to her nose and inhales deeply.  &quot;Mmmm!&quot; she purrs in approval before [[offering you a flower to sniff.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1088" name="offering you a flower to sniff." tags="" position="3515,2895" size="100,100">You attempt to smell the flower but its earthy odor is drowned out by something else.  You can&#39;t seem to shake this strange, fruity scent that seems to dog you wherever you go.  It seems to get stronger the closer you stand to this weird chick who claims to be you.  It is like she is surrounded by an aura of //thick air.//

&quot;Your… perfume….  is really strong,&quot; you mutter as you struggle to breathe properly.  Your words seem distant; hard to recall.

&quot;Hm?  I don&#39;t wear perfume,&quot; girl Taylor replies.  She jogs forward behind one of the largest sheds and then turns to face you.

You look around at the fairly open area.  You spot someone walking their dog about two hundred paces away.  [[&quot;What are we doing back here?&quot;]] you ask your mysterious guide.

Your jaw drops open.  You can’t believe your eyes.  &quot;Hnnnngghh….&quot;  //Holy fuck!  She isn&#39;t wearing underwear!// &quot;Are you for real?&quot;

You feel blood rush to your head and penis.  You are engorged and painfully dizzy a second later.

//Is this a fucking dream?// you wonder as Taylor steps forward and snatches the flowers from your hand.

You stare on in disbelief, admiring the stunning beauty in front of you.

//A few minutes ago I was dying… now there is a naked mega-babe in front of me claiming to be me….  I have no idea what the fuck is going on anymore.//  You consider the possibility that you are dreaming or perhaps even deceased.

//Maybe I had a stroke on the toilet and this is my brain&#39;s last gasp of DMT.//  Any explanation seemed more likely than the one offered by the crazy chick in front of you.

//Naked… crazy… chick...//  As you look on, your rational mind rallies only to be crushed by your perverted side.

You snap back to reality and raise a skeptical eyebrow.  &quot;So… no, then?&quot;

The woman claiming to be you sighs.  &quot;I am all woman.  I guess I am just you if you would have had a little chromosome swap… well, plus a few additions too.

&quot;Wrong.  I am a real person.  You, on the other hand, I am not so sure about…  You and Evan are one dimensional sometimes.&quot;

“Evan Moore?  I knew it.  He put you up to this!”

The woman raises an eyebrow and shrugs.  “Do you really think that if Evan had a lady friend that looked like me that he would keep it secret from you?”

“Hmm.  Good point…”

“Wow, your little friend sure is eager!” Taylor comments as she sashays forward and places her hand over your groin.

“Whoa!”  //I can’t believe this is really happening!//

“How about we make a deal,” Taylor suggests with a purr.   “I will help you out if you help me.  Deal?”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/porno.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You feast on the sexy visuals.  The porn star moans in pleasure as she throws her round butt backwards to meet the pistoning member that is fucking her from behind.  

“Oh yeah… Fuck her good!”

You rub your middle finger down your wet vagina.  The sensation reminds you of jacking off, but the unusual motion knocks you out of your fantasy for a moment.  You focus only on the feeling of pleasure and manage to drift back into the right mindset.

You can&#39;t decide which of the onscreen models is having the most fun. “Damn, she looks like she is having a great time… Ohh….”  //Schlick schlick...//

You imagine yourself fucking and then being fucked.  Both perspectives are exciting in their own way.  You begin to breath heavily; the pace of your stroking accelerates.  With each pass up and down your vagina, your finger sinks incrementally deeper inside you.  Soon you are penetrating yourself, gently [[probing the roof of your vaginal canal.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1096" name="probing the roof of your vaginal canal." tags="" position="10244,26448" size="100,100">“Eep!” you squeak as you hit a particularly sensitive spot.  The soft flesh of your finger massages a rough location.  //Did I just hit the g-spot jackpot?//  “Mmm….” you moan as you continue your self exploration.

You withdraw a glistening finger and find yourself drawn back to the tingling top of your vagina.  With your wet fingers, you gently peel back your clitoral hood and begin to work your fingers into the delicate flesh.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/clitrub.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ohhh…. Uhh…  God damnit that feels so good...”  Your eyes are drawn to a video in the sidebar.  Your curiosity quickly gets the better of you.

[[You click the link]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1097" name="You click the link" tags="" position="10396,26542" size="100,100">A very sexy blowjob video begins to play just as the pressure inside you reaches critical levels.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/hotbj.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A beautiful young woman licks a penis from ball to glans.  She then begins to suck on the head as if it is the most delicious lollipop in existence.  As she sucks the cock she smiles, her expression is one of bliss.

“Oh fuck.  That girl loves cock!” you pant as your eyes greedily take in the scene.  Your eyes dart back and forth between the woman and the penis.  //Why the hell does she look so happy?//  You feel flushed and hot.  //Am I… jealous?// the thought makes your head spin.  Your mouth begins to salivate.  You increase the pace of your masturbation until cumming is all you can think about.

Just as the erotic pressure within you reaches critical levels, you notice a cumshot video in the taskbar.

A cute babe is on her knees in front of a big cock.  Immediately, the man begins to cum, jerking off huge spurts of semen into the babe’s waiting mouth.  As he unloads and she eagerly slurps up his cum, milking his shaft clean, you lose it.  [[You begin to masturbate in a frenzy as you fall over the edge into depravity.]]

I can’t---uhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnn! Ahhhhhhhhhh!” you scream as your body switches to autopilot.  Your hips buck and rock, humping your hand as you submit to the call of beckoning pleasure.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taymast2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The last image you have before you cum is of a dick.  //Drew’s dick.//  Memories of your naughty moments spent with Drew flood home.

“Uhh…. Wow…  That was … intense…  Why do these fantasies turn me on so much?” you wonder.  As you inspect your dripping hand, you resume your internal battle.  //What the fuck is wrong with me?//  You are now satisfied but also a tad guilty and confused.

As you consider you rhetorical question, you lie back in a pool of your own sweat and juices, basking in your orgasm’s afterglow.

[[“Holy fuck…  I REALLY need to get my head together!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1101" name="“Holy fuck…  I REALLY need to get my head together!”" tags="" position="10242,26740" size="100,100">“Why am I thinking about dicks?  And boyfriends?  And Drew?  Ugh…”  You step outside for a moment of fresh air.  “Drew would make a pretty good boyfriend,” you predict.  You wince when you realize what you just said.  //Why did I say that?//  “Aghhh….”  You shake your head and give your face a few soft slaps.  “Yep!  I am //definitely// going nuts.  Probably all this fresh air I am getting, that shit is poisonous,” you remark.

You return inside and plop yourself in front of your PC.  You load up the first appealing game you find on your desktop.

You kill aliens for a while until you kill a boss monster that reminds you of a great moment years earlier with Drew.  //The two of us have conquered a lot of worlds together...//

You pause the game.  //Why can’t I stop thinking about Drew?  What the heck is wrong with me?  I should just refuse his stupid idea!  But I can’t… And worse yet…  I am really considering going on a date with Drew!//

You lie down in bed and stare at the ceiling.  Sleep is elusive and morning arrives far too quickly.

The next morning, you eat a light breakfast and head to school.  On the way to class [[you get a phone call.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1102" name="he admits." tags="" position="10393,28899" size="100,100">You raise an eyebrow.  “Don’t feel sorry for that guy.  He has made his choice.”

“I don’t know.  I just keep thinking that maybe he was a good person once,” Drew imagines.

“Or maybe he was always a piece of shit,” you counter.

Drew frowns.  “I think everybody has that potential.”

“What do you mean?  The potential for what?”

“//For anything//.  I think we all have the potential to be great… or to be a piece of shit.  If you get addicted to drugs a lot of people can’t pull themselves out of it.  Those that do often spend a fortune on rehab.  Easy to say “don’t do drugs” when everyone else is doing it and it is the only cheap escape from your shitty life.”

Drew’s sad tone and depressing words make you sit up.  //He kind of sounds like he relates to that guy...//  “Drew, are you happy?” you suddenly ask your friend.

Drew blinks rapidly a few times, as if he had never been asked such a question before.  “When I am with you I am happy,” he answers after a moment.

“Hah.  I enjoy your company too.”

“It is a lovely night… I am just glad I get to spend it with you, Taylor.”

The two of you lie back on the grass and [[watch the sunset together.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1103" name="watch the sunset together." tags="" position="10241,28997" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sunsetcity.jpg&quot;&gt;
Your city’s skyscrapers stand tall against a mesmerizing orange and pink sky.  As dusk finally overwhelms the day, the two of you shift your attention back to the hospital and a lonely security guard patrolling the area. 

You watch as the very portly security guard completes his rounds. The guard returns to a small booth near the parking lot entrance and slumps over almost immediately.

“Either he is dead or asleep,” you whisper to Drew as you head towards the gate.  Drew stops you and points to closest corner of the fencing.  The two of you creep to the opposite side of the parking lot and find a hole previously cut by vandals.  “Nice!  Now is our chance!”

Drew’s shirt gets snagged on the sharp metal but he crawls through.  He follows you as you head to the main entrance.

“What are the chances this is open?” you ask Drew.

“Fifty-fifty?”

With a deep breath, [[you push open the front door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1104" name="you push open the front door." tags="" position="10389,29039" size="100,100">With a groan the doors give way, revealing a sparsely illuminated lobby.  The first thing that surprises you is the presence of various wheelchairs and hospital beds.  You would have guessed all this stuff would have been cleaned out long ago.  

“I guess that&#39;s why they guard this place…”

After about three seconds in the dark, oppressive atmosphere of the old hospital, you begin to regret your decision.  //Who the fuck goes to an abandoned hospital on a date!?//

You use your phone’s torchlight to look around and film at the same time.  Drew is eyeing the way you came in but you give him a reassuring smile and step forward into the darkness.

[[Explore the hospital]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1105" name="Explore the hospital" tags="" position="10237,29141" size="100,100">The two of you proceed deeper into the spooky hospital.  You find yourself having a great time.  Exploring the hospital is an exciting albeit creepy adventure.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/hosptalexp.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“This place is like a giant haunted house,” you remark as you scope out various mostly empty rooms.  Many seem to have very expensive (if a bit dated) medical equipment left intact.

You hear a creaking noise and cast your light in the direction of the sound.  You find nothing except shadows and cobwebs.

“Did you hear that?” you ask Drew, only to discover he isn’t nearby.  [[“Drew?  Drew?  Where did you go?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1106" name="“Drew?  Drew?  Where did you go?”" tags="" position="10389,29191" size="100,100">You walk to the other side of the room an inspect a broken mirror.

//Smash!//

You jump into the air at the sound.  “Eeep!  Holy fuck!” you yelp as you fall backwards, almost knocking Drew to the ground in the process.  “That scared the hell out of me!”

“I am sorry.”

“It’s ...okay, I don’t mind,” Drew replies.

You are suddenly aware of your compromising position.  Your butt is pressed against Drew’s groin while your right foot is hooked around Drew’s.  You awkwardly untangle yourself.

“Where the hell did you get off to?”

“I was just looking out the window.  It is getting dark,” Drew warns.

You return to the hallway.  You have already been through most of this current floor.  In front of you are two somewhat imposing doors.

[[Try the large door on the left]]
[[Try the metallic door on the right]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1107" name="Try the large door on the left" tags="" position="10234,29293" size="100,100">You push open the door on the left.  With a hauntingly loud creek the door gives way revealing a pitch black hallway.

As you walk forward you note that this section is drafty and appears to have been previously vandalized.  

The windows in this area are all broken.  There are various messages spray painted on the walls.  Most of them are delightfully crude.

At the end of a hall of empty rooms, you enter a large room that reminds you a bit of a gymnasium.  The entire place has been trashed, nearly every square inch has some spray painted message.  Someone has written “death awaits” on the floor.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hospitalvandals.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Charming.  Somebody destroyed this entire wing I think.  Why can’t people just let good things be?  What a bunch of dicks.”

“I bet it was //teenagers//,” Drew speculates.  You giggle.

The two of you sweep through the wing.  Just as you start heading back the way you came, you [[discover another room hidden in the darkness.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1108" name="Try the metallic door on the right" tags="" position="10540,29289" size="100,100">You try the metallic door on your right.  The door seems stuck, although doesn’t appear to be locked.  

You give the door several solid kicks and it slides open a fraction of an inch.  You frown at your progress.  “I guess I don’t really have the mass I used to…”

“This is a job for--ME!” Drew says as he steps up.  “This is my moment to shine!”  With a comically light tap, Drew pushes open the door…  triggering a piercingly loud alarm.

//AAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!// the sound echoes around you.

The sudden sound nearly scares you half to death.  You and Drew exchange horrified, wide eyed glances as the only logical course of action leaps into the front of your mind.

[[“Let’s get the fuck out of here!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1109" name="“Let’s get the fuck out of here!”" tags="" position="10508,29783" size="100,100">Current end</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1110" name="discover another room hidden in the darkness." tags="" position="10386,29351" size="100,100">“I wonder what went on here…” you say as you look around at the piles of debris and broken tile.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hosproom.jpg&quot;&gt;
Drew examines the chair that is the room’s centerpiece.  

“Hmm…  I am not sure.  Perhaps this was for some kind of oral surgery or dental work maybe.”

“I was going to say “torture apparatus” but your explanation is pretty close.”

[[Search the room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1111" name="Search the room" tags="" position="10238,29445" size="100,100">Inside a wastebasket in the corner you find a tattered notepad with what appears to be an old invoice stapled to the front.

The paperwork is hard to read in the dying light but it seems to list a partial manifest for some items that were moved from the hospital.  On the notepad is a brief message: “The dismantling of the basement expansion is complete.  All equipment secure.  Immovables stripped and left in place,” you read aloud.

You hand the note to Drew.  “Hmm… it sounds like they would have taken everything of value,” he says after looking through the papers.

“That isn’t shocking,” you reply.  The two of you exit the room and then freeze when you enter the hallway.  

With your pounding heart threatening to escape your body, you slowly turn to Drew and whisper, [[“Do you see that?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1112" name="“Do you see that?”" tags="" position="10398,29499" size="100,100">“See wha----whooooaaaa….”  Drew trails off as he spots what has caught your interest.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hhall.jpg&quot;&gt;
At the end of the hall, you can see a //shadow// standing //within the light.//  It looks like a sunspot in your vision, something caused by eye strain.  Yet as you blink and pinch yourself, the figure only grows in size.

A chill runs down your spine.  You feel an intimidating presence.  Every fine hair remaining on your body stands on end.  There is clearly something //wrong// about what you are witnessing.  “What the fuck!?  It is moving!” you shout in warning as the shadow swells in size, becoming darker and larger until it takes up the entire doorway.

“Drew!  Get back!” you shout.

Drew needs no further urging; the two of you retreat down the hall.  When you think you have put enough distance between you and the mysterious phenomenon, [[you fearfully look over your shoulder.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1113" name="you fearfully look over your shoulder." tags="" position="10242,29589" size="100,100">You find that the hall is completely empty.  There is no sign of any trace of the black shadow.

Losing sight of the ghostly figure makes you incredibly nervous.  “It’s gone…  I could have sworn it was following us.  Where did it go?”  //I have faced enough terrifying virtual monsters over the years… but //invisible// foes?  Yikes...//  You have always preferred to sneak up on your target before annihilating them.  //But how do I sneak up on something invisible?//

“It //disappeared//…” Drew mumbles in disbelief.  He suddenly takes off his glasses and begins to polish them.

“Drew!  Snap out of it.  Seriously man, what the fuck was that!?”  You hope Drew has a logical explanation for what you just witnessed.  

Yet it is clear Drew has no answers… or at least ones you probably wouldn’t care to hear.  Drew is now so pale, he looks quite ghostly himself.  “It looked like a mini black hole! It could have been so many things... maybe it was an illusion or perhaps it was just a trick of the light,” [[he hypothesizes.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1114" name="he hypothesizes." tags="" position="10376,29640" size="100,100">“Or it could be a… a… ghost!” you lamely joke.  Yet your words provoke no laughter.  You are both genuinely freaked out.  “Did you get that on film?”

“No, I was too busy running for my life.”

“Fuck I just turned mine off too in order to conserve battery life.  The ghostbusters will never believe me!”

You stop at a nearby staircase and glance back towards the hospital’s main entrance.  You have already explored most of the hospital.  You seriously consider leaving the potentially haunted building then and there.

“Up or down?” Drew asks you, seemingly content to let you dictate the journey’s outcome.  You can’t help but be a bit touched by Drew’s bravery.  He is clearly terrified, but still willing to continue… if you are.
&lt;&lt;set $ghostpath to true&gt;&gt;
[[“Let’s get the fuck out of here!”]]
[[Go to the basement and search for “clues”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1115" name="Go to the basement and search for “clues”" tags="" position="10246,29837" size="100,100">“Let’s head down there,” you say, gesturing into the darkness.

“Down there?” Drew repeats doubtfully.  “Really?”

“Drew, you’re the one that suggested this “date.”  Say it with me.  Ghosts-”

“Do not exist,” you finish together in unison.  Your mantra makes you feel a bit more confident.  Drew visibly perks up as well.

Drew blinks rapidly.  “That’s right!  There has to be a logical explanation for what we saw!”

“Or a spooky one.”

“Ghosts do not exist,” Drew mumbles as he follows you down into the basement.

“Wow it is fucking creepy down here.”  The basement is shockingly cavernous.  You see no sign of anything, living or dead.

“It is like a warehouse.  I can’t believe how big this area is!” Drew remarks as he directs his light to the high ceilings.

In the corner of the basement is a row of concrete structures that appear to be connected to some kind of ventilation system.  “What are these?” you wonder aloud.  After inspecting one of the objects, you notice Drew has stopped.  You shine your light at him.  His face is ghostly white.  “Drew?  What’s wrong?”

[[“Taylor, I don’t think we should be down here.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1116" name="“Taylor, I don’t think we should be down here.”" tags="" position="10388,29895" size="100,100">
“What the hell?  There isn’t even anything down here!  Except for these…”  //What are these things?//

Drew swallows audibly before finishing your sentence.  “//Incinerators.//  Taylor, they are //incinerators!//”

“//All of them!?//  What the fuck!?  I could see needing //one//.  That is still creepy as fuck but what the hell would they need so many incinerators for?”  As soon as you ask the question you regret it.  

Just as your imagination runs wild, Drew answers, “Burning a lot of bodies…” he grimly concludes.

An immensely creepy montage of half remembered black and white Auschwitz WWII photographs plays through your mind.  “This place was a crematorium?  How is that even possible?”

“I don’t know…  But I think we should leave before that //thing// comes back.  I don’t think I want to know what Trans Corp was doing here!  It isn’t worth dying over!” 

“Yeah, I am getting a really bad vibe from this place,&quot; you agree.  &quot;Let’s [[get the hell out of here!”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1117" name="confused Drew." tags="" position="10394,30043" size="100,100">“We almost got caught!” you say as you squirm from underneath Drew and sit up.  Drew is conspicuously silent.  He looks like he just witnessed an alien landing… or maybe a ghost.  //Except he is looking at me...//  He keeps silently mouthing words that you can’t quite make out.  You feel a tingle of excitement and laugh at Drew’s expression.  “Okay Drew, I gotta admit this was actually a pretty great idea.  That you brought me to this weird ass hospital… Just so we could have a small chance to learn about something that might help me.  You’re always looking out for me… even on a date.”  You sigh in frustration.  “This is at least half about you.  Our time like this is short and you still want to spend it helping me.  It isn’t right, Drew.  This is your date too…  Come here for a sec.”  You beckon Drew forth with a wagging finger.

You kiss Drew on the cheek except this kiss cannot be blamed on accident.  “That was… very sweet of you, Drew.  This was the best date I have ever had,” you whisper to your friend.

You kiss Drew again and this time your lips find his.  The two of you begin to make out.  For a brief moment, you forget you are in the lobby of [[a fucking haunted hospital.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1118" name="a fucking haunted hospital." tags="" position="10242,30145" size="100,100">You find Drew’s response to be clumsy but also oddly cute at the same time.  Your lips meet and part ungracefully.  Drew’s inexperience just makes you want to take the reins and //teach// him properly.  You both seem to enjoy the awkward exploration of each other’s lips.  Eventually you break apart and the two of you sit in stunned silence as you both process what has just happened.

“Wow, that was...//amazing,//” Drew says while breathing heavily.  He seems utterly captivated by you.

You bite your lip, unsure of what to say.  //Or perhaps I wouldn’t trust myself to say the right words…  I don’t want to make things worse!//  

Drew blinks and adjusts his slanted glasses.  He looks around and becomes visibly alarmed.

“We should get out of here,” he says to you.

“Oh… I thought you might want to stick around.  [[It was kind of cozy there, wasn’t it?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1119" name="It was kind of cozy there, wasn’t it?”" tags="" position="10390,30199" size="100,100">Your meaning seems to escape Drew.  Drew shoots a glance over his shoulder.  “What if the ghost comes back?”

“Ghosts don’t exist!” you snort.  

“We both saw it, Taylor.”

“I blame bad lighting and possible food poisoning from that Chinese,” you conclude.

The idea seems plausible to Drew.  He nods his head thoughtfully.  “I do get food poisoning a few times a month…”

You shake your head in amazement.  “Dude, that is way too frequent!  You need to start taking care of yourself.  Eat a vegetable on occasion please, for me?”

“I-- I’d d-do anything for you…” Drew stammers.

“Really?  You would eat a vegetable other than a potato?” you tease Drew. 

He nods eagerly.  You stare at each other in the dim light until it becomes clear that [[you will have to take control.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1120" name="you will have to take control." tags="" position="10246,30297" size="100,100">“Where were we, Drew?”  You feel your heartbeat accelerate and an almost unbearable tension encase both of you.

You set a hand down on Drew’s knee and run your soft fingers down his leg.  Soon your hand finds its way to Drew’s groin.  

Drew tenses up immediately.  “Taylor!  Are you… sure?”

“It’s not that big of a deal!” you assure Drew.  //Err--I mean it kinda is...//  You know doing sexual things with Drew will probably not be good for your long term friendship but you can’t help yourself.  //That’s right!  When I change back into a dude our relationship will already be super weird!//

A queer realization suddenly strikes you in that moment.  “But I am not a man… at least not completely…”

“Taylor?  Are you okay?”

“Huh?  Yep!  I am just … [[sorting out my thoughts.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1121" name="sorting out my thoughts.”" tags="" position="10386,30347" size="100,100">“I am still kind of shocked you suggested this,” you admit to Drew.

Drew nods thoughtfully.  “It is kind of scary but also thrilling at the same time.  With you around I feel like I can do… what I actually want to do.  I get to be the way I want to be, instead of the way I am… or was… even if it is only temporary.  If that makes any sense...”

“Not really.”

Drew gives you a sad smile.  “You don’t judge me.  You make me braver.  You make me want to be a better person.”

You return his smile.  “We all want to become a better version of ourselves.”

“Chasing happiness is a waste when you’re everything I have ever wanted and you’re right in front of me.”

Drew&#39;s confession leaves you speechless.  Drew looks around nervously as you begin to rub his erection through the fabric of his pants.

//Right now I am just a girl… on a very weird date with my best friend…  My first and last date with Drew Drachmann...//  

You feel horribly mixed up but above the fray you have two dominant feelings: a sense of obligation and arousal.

Your hand unzips Drew’s pants and slips into his underwear.  You coil your fingers around Drew’s shaft and begin to slowly jerk him off.

Drew gasps and then moans.  “That feels so good!”

Suddenly you are blinded by light.  [[“WHO IS THERE!?” a voice shouts at you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1122" name="“WHO IS THERE!?” a voice shouts at you." tags="" position="10242,30445" size="100,100">“Holy fuck!” you scream in panic as you and Drew both struggle to rise and flee at the same time.  You knock heads and nearly drop back down between the lobby seating.

“Halt!  Stay right there!” orders the guard.  You hear running boots and the jingle of keys.

You grab hold of and throttle your panic.  “Fuck that!”  You bounce back to your feet and offer Drew a hand.  He nearly drags you back down as he struggles to rise.  

The two of you run in the opposite direction as your pursuer.  You head [[back out into the hall.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1123" name="back out into the hall." tags="" position="10386,30491" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hhall.jpg&quot;&gt;
“OH fucking no!  Just no.  NOPE!  We are going this way Drew!” you point at a nearby emergency escape exit.

Drew needs no further encouragement.  You push through the door and hear the click of another alarm being set off.  //Let’s hope that one is just for the fire department!//

“Let’s run, Drew!”  You grab Drew’s sweaty hand and pull him out into the cool night air.  You can hear cursing… and a weird howling sound following close behind you.  You run past the guard station and jump over the divider.  The two of you keep running until you reach the end of the hospital’s road.

Drew doubles over while gasping for breath.  [[You use the opportunity to look over your shoulder.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1124" name="You use the opportunity to look over your shoulder." tags="" position="10242,30589" size="100,100">You see the guard finally reach the divider you just crossed.  The portly fellow ungracefully climbs over the barrier and then stops dead.  As you watch the guard sweep his flashflight around the area, you notice an ominous shadow coalesce behind him.  //What the fuck!?//  

//VROOOSH!!!//

One instant the guard is standing there, the next only his bloody boots remain.

You can’t believe your eyes.  You look at Drew with a look of terror but he is luckily still facing the opposite direction.  You desperately wish you could //unsee// the previous five seconds.

[[Every fiber of your being screams at you to flee.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1125" name="Every fiber of your being screams at you to flee." tags="" position="10390,30639" size="100,100">You grab Drew’s hand and drag him out onto the main street.  You flag down the first cab you see.

You feel a tiny bit safer once inside the car.  You give the cabbie your address and ride in silence with Drew back to your place.

“Thanks for the most memorable date of my life,” you say to Drew when you arrive.  Drew just nods and gives you a somewhat blank look.  He seems traumatized.  

You feel even worse after what you just witnessed.  You give the driver Drew’s address and pay him.

“I will call you tomorrow Drew.”

You watch the cab depart until it disappears from view.  You head into your house and walk into your room, immediately collapsing on the bed.  You felt incredibly mixed up before you had left this morning.  Now things are much worse.  //I kissed Drew.  I encountered a murderous ghost...//  

“Yep, my dreams are going to be so FUCKED tonight,” you predict.  “If I can even fall asleep.&quot;

It takes ages as well as a cold shower before you feel tired.  When you finally fall asleep, you find [[your prediction to be accurate.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1126" name="your prediction to be accurate." tags="" position="10246,30745" size="100,100">
You open your eyes and find yourself in your underwear, in a room with indistinct boundaries.  The dark purple walls are foggy.  You feel like you have stumbled onto the set for a B-list horror film.  //Either that or I am dreaming…  Wait… If this is a dream why the heck am I still a chick?//

“Hello?  Is there anybody there?” you call out into the darkness.

“Taylor!” a voice shouts from behind you.

You spin on your heel and find Drew standing before you, his body cloaked in wispy white clouds.

“Drew!?  Where are we?”

Drew winces and ignores your question.  “I need your help,” he says to you as he stares off into space.

“What’s wrong!?  Are you hurt?”  Something in Drew’s tone drives you to take a step forward out of concern.

As you move towards Drew the fog dissipates, [[revealing Drew’s naked body and erection.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1127" name="revealing Drew’s naked body and erection." tags="" position="10390,30795" size="100,100">
You stop dead.  Your eyes are drawn downward, passing Drew’s prominent belly, and landing on your friend’s pink cock.

“Why the fuck are you naked!?” you screech at Drew.

He stares at you impassively, standing perfectly still like a statue.  “I need your help,” Drew repeats.

//This has to be a dream!//  You close your eyes and pinch yourself.  When you open them again the room has changed.  Although Drew remains, you can no longer see the walls.

“This is a dream!” you assert.  “I have to wake up!”

To your horror, the Drew doppelganger begins to masturbate.  You retreat through the swirling fog, your footfalls echoing around you like gunshots.

Your internal compass spins in all directions.  You run until you are out of breath.  An eddy in the fog reveals a clearing and you seize the opportunity and step through.  You enter a room with a PC sitting on a table.  Aside from the computer and a small chair, the area is seemingly empty.

You sit at the PC and [[put your hand on the mouse.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1128" name="put your hand on the mouse." tags="" position="10246,30893" size="100,100">The PC rumbles to life as you hear the fans and drives spin up.  The screen flashes and greets you with a very explicit scene:
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumonbody.jpg&quot;&gt;
You see an image of a woman with cum from her pussy all the way to her nose.  She has semen  all over her stomach.  It looks like the photo was taken a moment right after the guy pulled out.  You note the girl’s satisfied smile.  With her eyes cut off like that you can’t quite make out the face.  //She could be anybody… maybe even me… Aghh!//

“She clearly enjoyed herself though…  And the dude too…  Fuck, he really blasted her!”  The distance of the ejaculation shocks you.  “How the hell do guys cum so much?  There is no fucking way that is half a teaspoon…”

“Aghh!  Fuck!  Why am I thinking about this?  Who in the fuck’s computer is this anyway?”

A nameplate suddenly appears over the monitor.  With an uneasy feeling, [[you read the writing.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1129" name="you read the writing." tags="" position="10398,30939" size="100,100">//Drew Drachmann.//

“Uhh…”  //Oh man…  Why am I dreaming about this?// 

You click the mouse again.

You are greeted by the picture of a familiar penis.  You blink twice.  //Wait a sec…  that’s Drew’s dick!//  “Fuck…  This is seriously not a good sign I can pick my friend’s dick out of a lineup.  You try and find the edge of the screen but the computer interface does not work as intended.

You madly click the mouse until a desktop appears from a blur of pronographic images.  The wallpaper of a Terran destroyer is nearly covered with icons.  

You open one of the documents and are greeted with a giant spiral of confusing data.  You randomly check through several of the icons and find only porn.  Soon you find random bits of information.  //It looks like Drew was researching my condition.  He really put a lot of effort into all this…  Is this supposed to represent a snapshot of Drew’s mind or my own?  Or maybe how I see Drew?  Or maybe this just a dream and I am nuts!//  As you inspect the final document, [[you feel overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1130" name="you feel overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt." tags="" position="10250,31041" size="100,100">A significant number of the reports have something to do with your transformation and cover a variety of explanations.  It is plain that Drew spent a shitload of time researching your condition.  //All to help me...//

“This is just a dream though,” you assure yourself with a sigh.  “But dreams are influenced by reality… damnit!  I don’t need a weird dream to know Drew is a dedicated friend!”  It is because of Drew&#39;s efforts that you are on the road to recovery and that you now have a good chance of getting your old life back.  You have to acknowledge that perhaps a small part of you doesn’t want to go back just so you could preserve your current friendship with Drew.  You doubt you would feel comfortable hanging out on a game night in the future given what you have already done.  //It just wouldn’t feel right…  But what does feel right anymore?  Fuck!  Aghh...//

“Drew...He’s practically saved my life…  And all I have done is make everything ...weird and confusing.”  You appraise your own jumbled thoughts and suddenly realize that Drew probably feels the exact same way.

[[You click on a numbered file with a default icon.]]

A picture of cum covered young woman holding a large penis appears on screen.  “Holy…” You feel a dull tingle begin to spread throughout your lower body.

Your left hand is drawn to your uncomfortably wet pussy.  The tingle intensifies until you can no longer resist.  You slowly begin to stroke yourself but your movements soon become rapid and deep.

“I can’t seem to stop… Uhhh…   I have to get out of here!”  //Ahhh!  Fuck I am horny!//  You feel the erotic pressure building within you.  Instead of fleeing, [[you click again.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1132" name="you click again." tags="" position="10246,31193" size="100,100">An image of a green eyed beauty fills the screen.  She has a big mouth full of cum that she is displaying to the photographer.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/compfacial2.jpg&quot;&gt;
You find the sight to be very arousing. 

“Hnnggh…  She is so fucking hot… and she loves it…  She loves cum!”  You wish the image was animated and that the pictured girl would swallow the semen pooled in her mouth.

//Semen… pooled… in her mouth… ?//  The sight frightens and excites you.  //She looks so sexy!//  To your dismay, you realize you are slightly //jealous//.  You lick your suddenly parched lips and shake your head.  Even though it is a dream, the room now feels sweltering.  You are embarrassed but intrigued.

Your bouncing hand keeps stimulating your clit.  As you stare at the picture and masturbate, an intense orgasm approaches and beckons you towards greater heights of bliss.

“Uhhh ohh!  Uhnnnnnnnnnnnnn!” you howl as your hips buck and twitch during your release.  You cum hard and surprise yourself with the volume of your bodily secretions.

You hold up a cum drenched hand to inspect.  To your surprise, it looks and smells like it is covered in semen.  

“What!?  How did I….?”

[[You look down and nearly scream.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1133" name="You look down and nearly scream." tags="" position="10390,31235" size="100,100">Your stomach has somehow been splattered with a large amount of cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lower.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Wow…  There is so much!  Fucking gross!  Where did this come from!?”  //Dreams don’t always make sense!// you tell yourself as your mind struggles for a suitable answer.  You feel sick when your next thought adds, //But this is a product of MY fucked up mind!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!//  

You stare at the viscous white fluid.  //If this would have //happened// inside me…  Fucking hell!  I don’t want to get pregnant.  Or dream-pregnant!  … Immaculate conception?!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  Why are my dreams so fucked up!?  Why am I so fucked up!?  What is wrong with me!?//

You snap awake.  You are covered in sweat.  A probing hand, touches your soaked underwear.  //Ugh… maybe girls do have wet dreams...//

[[The next day you wake up feeling guilty.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1134" name="The next day you wake up feeling guilty." tags="" position="10246,31345" size="100,100">Most dreams seem to fade away not long after waking.  This one is an exception.  Your confusing thoughts dog you all the way to school.

Luckily you don’t have Deter’s class on Tuesday mornings so you manage to get through the day without seeing Drew, even thought he is frequently in your thoughts.

After class, you continue your self introspection on the way home.  “I wanted that date to be special for Drew…  Instead, he almost ruined it just for a small chance to help me!  Ugh!  And we could have fucking //died!//”  Drew’s actions were incredibly frustrating.  //How the hell can I ever pay him back if he keeps adding to the debt!?//  It makes you even angrier knowing that Drew would never see it that way.

“I will do something nice for him…” you murmur to yourself.  Your eyes fall on a dilapidated box in the corner of your room.  You smile as you read the label.  “Cowper’s Cosplay.”  //I just had a great idea!  I think it is time for Taylor the maid to make her glorious return!//

A couple minutes later, [[you are staring at your fidgeting reflection.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1135" name="friend&#39;s pale cheeks." tags="" position="3206,3193" size="100,100">You bask in the soup of endorphins left by your orgasm.  &quot;Sweet… merciful… fuck… that was amazing.  I can&#39;t believe that just happened…&quot;  You direct your spotted vision up to the sky and feel a moment of clarity return to you.  With your arousal momentarily quenched, you now feel very embarrassed… and a tad scared.  //What the fuck just happened!?//

You look at the girl and catch her staring at you.  She grins at out you, wiping your cum off her face into her hand… and then slapping you across the face with it.

The rapid assault stuns you.  Cheek stinging, your first instinct is to apologize but the young woman cuts you off with a wave of her delicate hand.

“Great!  Now I need your help for something tomorrow,” she says offhandedly.

//What did I just agree to do?//

“That sounds… //vague//,” you reply.

Taylor shrugs.  &quot;I got to keep my head down for the next couple of days.  Mind if I crash with you?&quot; she asks you while batting her long eyelashes.

//She wants to… stay with me!?//  Alarmed, with lewd thoughts flashing through your mind, you feel your cheeks flush.  You imagine this babe staying in your room for a week.  //The two of us snuggled up together… eh he he he HA HA!//  The idea of having a total fox hang out with you is very appealing… still, that babe definitely has a screw loose….  //Or more than a few!  Hmm… I really want to bang this chick but I also don’t want to get murdered…  Decisions!//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1136" name="Invite the strange girl to stay with you" tags="" position="3117,3338" size="100,100">Against your better judgement, you invite the mysterious girl to your house.

“See, I knew you were cool!” Taylor says while slapping you on the back.

//I guess I have a new roommate… a super hot one!// 

&quot;So are you homeless or something?&quot;

&quot;Not anymore,&quot; she answers with a smirk. &quot;I appreciate your understanding though. I have a quick errand to run. I&#39;ll meet you back at … //our// place in a few hours.&quot;

&quot;Wait, I haven&#39;t told you where I live…&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I already know everything. I can always let myself in with the spare key under the cat statue.&quot;

//What!? How the fuck does she know about that?!// Your thoughts must be conveyed by your expression.

Taylor shrugs. &quot;Magic.&quot;

//I think I might have just met my very first stalker… and invited her to live with me.//

You part ways and return home. A few minutes before midnight, there is a knock at your front door.

&quot;It&#39;s me!&quot; calls a familiar voice.

Like an ongoing strange dream, the woman from earlier returns into your life.

In the enclosed space of your house, you find her cherry perfume to be absolutely stifling. You gawk at her awkwardly in your entryway, amazed that such a beautiful woman has sought out your company and help.

//Maybe she is just taking advantage of me but… do I even care!?//

You give Taylor a pillow and blanket and she is sawing logs on your couch within a minute.

&quot;I guess she is tired…&quot; You study Taylor&#39;s face. &quot;She is really pretty… and familiar… I wonder if I have seen her somewhere before… Ahh, what a day!&quot;

You return to your room and fall into bed.

In the morning, [[you wake up with someone lying beside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1137" name="Tell her she will have to find her own place" tags="" position="3311,3338" size="100,100">(Current end for now!

&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $bustytay to true&gt;&gt;
Your plan is either a stroke of genius or an incredibly irresponsible and stupid idea.  

“And I can’t even tell which it is anymore…. fuck.”

//I will become the girl he wants me to be… at least for a little while!//  “I will become his tailor made maid… again…”

You concentrate on your reflection and increase your bust and hip size.  The eerie sensation makes every hair on your body stand on end.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bustytaypic.jpg&quot;&gt;
You hold up your hand and concentrate.  You will your nails to become black and they soon morph to an ebony tint.  

“Wow, the makeup industry might put a hit on me too!”

You mess around with you physical appearance until you begin to feel like you are using an in-real-life character creation screen.

[[“Fuck, I could be here all day…”]] you joke as you play with the color of your irises. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1139" name="“Fuck, I could be here all day…”" tags="" position="10242,31493" size="100,100">An hour later you are in front of Drew’s house.  You stop short of knocking and take a moment to collect yourself and slip into character.

For some reason you find this act to be strangely exciting.

You rap on the door.  “Hello, master!” you greet Drew when he answers.  He nearly has a heart attack when he sees you.

“Taylor!?”

“The Maid!” you finish the introduction.

Drew just stares at you with his mouth hanging open.  “It isn’t my birthday…”

“Who said anything about a birthday?  I am just here to provide some, uh, maid service!”

“Taylor, you don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.”

“Drew, I want to,” you answer.  //Well, kind of… more than I should at any rate...//

“I should be the one thanking you, not the other way around!” Drew vehemently objects.

[[“I am not sure what you mean…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1140" name="“I am not sure what you mean…”" tags="" position="10390,31539" size="100,100">Drew takes a deep breath before answering.  “Our, uhh, //moment// together really meant a lot to me.   Thank you Taylor, from the bottom of my heart.  That was by far the best experience of my entire pathetic life.  Thanks for the best date ever!”

Drew’s earnestness strikes a chord with you.  //The best date ever…?  I fucking witnessed a murder!  Fuck, c’mon, Tay, don’t think about that!//  You blacklist any thoughts about ghostly murders and focus solely on the young man in front of you.

“It could always be better,” you say, surprising even yourself with the unusually spontaneous reply and its implications.

Drew seems to be confused, staring at you blankly until you lead the way into his bedroom.  

“What would you like me to do?” you ask your “master.”

Drew closes his eyes for a moment and begins to silently mouth a familiar mantra.  

“I am the master and Taylor is the maid?” he mumbles, the words more a question than a statement.

[[“That’s right,” you confirm.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1141" name="“That’s right,” you confirm." tags="" position="10242,31641" size="100,100">Drew looks you right in the eyes as he begins to speak in a hoarse voice.  “I want...you…”  The words bold hang over your head like a dark, ominous cloud.  “to lie down on my bed,” he commands you.  //Yikes, that is only marginally better!//

You can’t help but be surprised by Drew’s sudden turn around.

Maybe your time with Drew has nurtured a tiny streak of self confidence.  You bend over and reposition yourself on the bed.  To your surprise Drew follows you, flipping up your skirt to provide a prime view of your panty covered real estate.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/maidservice.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Drew begins to touch you immediately.

“Hey!  What are you doing down there?”

“What I have wanted to do to you for ages.  [[I am your master, remember?”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1142" name="I am your master, remember?”" tags="" position="10396,31690" size="100,100">“Uh…”  //I knew this was a bad idea...//  “Yeah…”

“I was thinking, Taylor, that maybe there is a chance this is fun for you too.  Am I right?”

Your blushing face is all the answer Drew needs.  He begins to rub your panty covered slit.  Soon your vagina is tingling and warm.

//Am… I getting aroused by Drew?//

It suddenly strikes you how bizarre this whole scenario truly is.

//I am standing in front of Drew dressed like a slutty French maid!//  Your friend looks up at you with open-mouthed rapture and a look of intense longing.  You can’t help but be encouraged by his reaction.

“Taylor, I want you to… Uh… [[Show me your boobs please--er just show them!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1143" name="Show me your boobs please--er just show them!”" tags="" position="10240,31788" size="100,100">
 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/maidservice2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You have already dug yourself into a deep hole.  //The only way out is to keep digging deeper!//

“I guess I can’t really blame you… I played with these puppies in the mirror for quite awhile before I came over.”

Without further ceremony, you bare your huge breasts for your best friend.

Drew gasps in amazement.  “They are //awesome//…” is all he manages to say for several minutes.  “I want to touch them too,” he finally says.

You sigh.  The room feels uncomfortably hot.  //Maybe it would be nice to shed a few clothes...//  “Go ahead.”

With your permission attained, Drew begins to grope your ample chest.

“Whoa… These are spectacular!” Drew mumbles as he kneads his thumbs into your soft flesh.

“They sure are…”  You let Drew fondle you for a small eternity.  He is like a kid lost in a candy and toy story with an unlimited budget.

Eventually you begin to feel unbearably hot.  You notice that Drew has discovered your hard nipples.

“Uh… that’s enough, Drew, er “master.””  You pull away from Drew and pull up your bra. [[“How about I make you some dinner?”]] you suggest.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1144" name="“How about I make you some dinner?”" tags="" position="10396,31838" size="100,100">At the mention of food, Drew’s eye’s light up.  “Yes,” he agrees.  “Make me dinner!”

You retreat outside Drew’s stuffy room to the kitchen.  You survey Drew’s immense, fully stocked pantry.  //Fuck I could make almost anything… if I knew how...//

You decide to:
[[Put some effort into it]]
[[Make a simple dish]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1145" name="Put some effort into it" tags="" position="10241,31936" size="100,100">Drew eagerly watches you glide around the kitchen.  You defrost some chicken and vegetables while you prepare a marinade recipe you stole from your mom.

It takes you over an hour of chopping and cooking but you finally have prepared most of the base dishes.  You put the chicken in the oven as you start to boil some rice which you mix with a medley of chopped onions and celery.

“Wow, I made a huge mess… Good thing I am a maid,” you note dryly as you survey the mound of dishes.

Drew doesn’t speak to you much while you are working.  He seems lost in his own thoughts… and your curves.

After another hour you finally serve Drew a dish that looks like it [[belongs in a pricey restaurant.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1146" name="Make a simple dish" tags="" position="10539,31936" size="100,100">simplicity is the death of cousine!

Drew devours the meal while you watch with a faint smile.

“That was the best chicken I have ever had,” Drew remarks once finished.

“The last chicken you ate is usually the best one, right?” you tease.

Drew’s eyes narrow.  “That is a tad insubordinate,” he notes.

You laugh.  “Then //punish me, master//!” you reply jokingly.  Except Drew doesn’t seem to take it as a joke.

“Okay, bend over that chair there,” Drew replies.

“Are you kidding me?”

[[“Bend over,” Drew repeats.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1148" name="“Bend over,” Drew repeats." tags="" position="10245,32080" size="100,100">You default into your role as a maid.  You do as commanded.  //This is definitely going too far… but maybe I already crossed some invisible line long ago,// you think as you drape yourself over a stool at the island.  A second later, Drew pulls up your skirt and you brace yourself.  You expect Drew to rub your panties, instead he slaps you //hard// across your ass cheeks.

“Ow!  Whoa!  What the hell Drew?  That hurts!”  Instead of replying Drew gives you another few loud smacks.

The suddenness of the assault makes you tense up.  You don’t resist when Drew slips a hand into your underwear.

He begins to rub the outline of your pussy.  When he withdraws his hand, you both notice it is covered with glistening clear fluid.  //Uh oh...//

“I think I know why you are really here,” Drew says to you.

[[“And why is that?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1149" name="“And why is that?”" tags="" position="10397,32138" size="100,100">“Because you want this too.  I don’t know why I didn’t realize this earlier.  You’re a woman now and women have //needs// just like men.”

“What kind of needs?” you ask, instantly regretting your question.  

“Sexual ones.  You are going to… to drop to your knees and give me a blowjob.” 

“Whaaat?”  //Did Drew just get possessed by the ghost of Evan!?//  “I am going to give you a blowjob?”

“Yes, you are.  You’re the sexiest maid in the world.  Please help your master out.  I have been like this since the moment I opened the door,” Drew says to you as he unzips his fly, presenting you with a familiar pink erection.

You decide not think too deeply about your actions.  //We are just two friends in the moment...//

You grab a nearby towel from a laundry basket and throw it down [[before dropping to your knees in front of your best friend.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1150" name="before dropping to your knees in front of your best friend." tags="" position="10245,32240" size="100,100">
 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/maidservice3.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You waste no more time, setting to work with your earlier experiences and fantasies in mind. 

You do your best to make Drew feel good.

“Taylor!  OH my… uhhhh….. Ahh…. ohh….”

Soon you are mindlessly pleasuring Drew, sucking and [[jerking off his rock hard penis.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1151" name="jerking off his rock hard penis." tags="" position="10397,32286" size="100,100">“Mwah.”  You kiss Drew’s glans and then like the salty transference from your full lips.

You massage Drew’s penis and rub his balls while swirling your tongue over his head until Drew is moaning with ecstasy and clearly pushed past his breaking point.


 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taylormaid.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Using your tongue as a landing pad, you stroke Drew to completion.  He ejaculates all over your waiting, eager tongue.

In an epic finale to your show, you swallow the huge load in one big gulp and then playfully lap up the last of Drew’s semen.

Drew is covered in sweat and swaying slightly.  His eyes are unfocused.  “H-how does it taste?” Drew asks you when his huffing and puffing subsides. 

You can’t help but analyze the flavor lingering on your tongue.  It tastes like fishy snot if you had to describe it accurately.  You take a deep breath and fight off the urge to gag and retch.  //I am just putting on a show for Drew!// you rationalize.

You look up into Drew’s eyes and find your answer.
[[“It tastes so good…”]]
[[“I hope you appreciate this.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1152" name="“It tastes so good…”" tags="" position="10246,32444" size="100,100">You tell Drew exactly what he wants to hear.  You lick your lips clean.  “Mmm… it tastes //soo// good, Drew.  Thanks for the //delicious// treat,” you moan to Drew in your best porn star voice.

With those words and the taste of Drew’s seed on your tongue, he seems content to die right then and there.

Drew faints, toppling over onto the couch.  [[You are left alone with a vague feeling of accomplishment and embarrassment.]]



</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1153" name="“I hope you appreciate this.”" tags="" position="10548,32440" size="100,100">“I hope you appreciate this.”

You dutifully swallow Drew’s seed and do your best to hide your distaste.

[[You are left alone with a vague feeling of accomplishment and embarrassment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1154" name="she commands you." tags="" position="3357,3092" size="100,100">Despite a feeling of intense unease, your instinct is to obey.  You stumble forward but stop short when the woman places a cold palm just above your groin.

You look down in disbelief as the crazy chick drops to her knees while undoing your pants.

Your dick flops out and nearly clubs her in the face.

&quot;I guess it does look a bit bigger than I remember from this point of view…&quot;  The woman begins to give you a handjob.  Taylor looks irritated but also incredibly sexy.  

The combination of her heady perfume and soft hands stroking your penis is magical. 

&quot;Hol--y… shit… UGH!&quot;  You groan.  Your day started off on a bad note but now it is changing into one of the highlights of your life.  &quot;I am going to--uhhhhhhhhh!&quot;  When your partner senses your orgasm approaching, she begins to pump your cock with an intensity that soon drives you over the edge.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/helpout.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You nearly fall over as you go weak in the knees, cumming all over your new [[friend&#39;s pale cheeks.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1155" name="get the hell out of here!”" tags="" position="10249,29986" size="100,100">The two of you dash up the stairs and make your way back to the lobby.  Just as you are about to step outside, you see a flashlight sweeping the area.

“Shit!  Get down!” you hiss as you pull Drew down between two rows of chairs.

Drew falls on top of you, pinning you to the floor with his considerably greater weight.  Your faces end up hovering close together.  You feel Drew’s hot breath on your lips and become conscious of your flushing face.  You look through Drew’s lopsided glasses at his big, surprised eyes.

“Taylor!”

You see the yellow halo of a flashlight land on the wall above you.  “Shhh!” you hush Drew, covering your lips with his.

After an agonizing twenty seconds, you hear retreating footsteps and finally release a sweating, [[confused Drew.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1156" name="are sent echoing throughout the room." tags="" position="14728,9334" size="100,100">“Uhhh!  I am…” Is all Damien manages to stammer before he begins to buck his hips and thrust forward, nearly throwing you from your already awkward position as he climaxes.  Damien’s cock bulges and you can feel the internal muscle convulsions launching his semen forward.  For a moment you almost laugh, feeling proud and a tad naughty….  only to suddenly become aware that the huge cock you are massaging is aimed at your face.  Due to your small body and awkward position, Damien’s manhood is mere inches from your face and pointed directly at your open mouth.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lshot.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh no,” you say as Damien ejaculates all over your face.  You find yourself frozen, unable to do anything but dumbly receive his seed.  Several massive spurts of Damien’s smelly semen coat your cheeks and tongue.  It’s strange fishy taste and odor overwhelms you.

“Ick! So much….  You came so much…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lfacial2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Yep, all for my little girl.  That is such a good look for you!” [[Damien compliments you as his cum drips from your lips.]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1157" name="Damien compliments you as his cum drips from your lips." tags="" position="14578,9378" size="100,100">You flee from Damien’s room and spend the next hour showering and rinsing your mouth out.

Afterwards you find that you are exhausted.  You pass out on the makeshift bed you made on Damien’s couch.

At some point in the night you have a dream that you are being carried away.

The next morning you wake up with a splitting headache.

You look at your strangely small extremities and inspect your tiny, delicate hands.  “Fuck.  This wasn’t a dream…” you say as you sit up.

“No, it was all real… All real… Mmm...” Damien murmurs sleepily from beside you.

“Huh?  What the f--....  Eww…”  You cringe as your eyes land on Damien’s naked figure.

“Good morning beautiful,” Damien murmurs.  He extends his hand out to touch your face and you slap it away.

“Damien!  Why the hell am I in your room again!?”

“Hmm.  I guess you really are a horny little minx and you just couldn’t help yourself?” Damien suggests.

“You totally abducted me from the couch last night!” you accuse him.  Damien’s face flushes with embarrassment, [[confirming your suspicions.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1158" name="confirming your suspicions." tags="" position="14729,9482" size="100,100">“Damien, you are such an asshole.  I don’t know what I can say to get through to you.”

“So what then?  I was just supposed to //ignore you//?”  

“Yes!”

“You’re saying I should //not have carried you to my room?//  Do you not hear how insane that sounds?”

“You’re the one that sounds insane!”

“No way!  You’re just too cute!  I saw you sleeping there… and I just had to bring you up here.  I love cute things!”

“I am not a //thing!//  Get yourself a stuffed animal, you big creep-o.”

Damien’s face falls.  “That isn’t the same.”  You recall the events of the previous night.  //Obviously not… what a pervert!//

“You’re just so… beautiful and angelic and cute!  And...and...and I really really want to defile you and make you mine!”

“I may look like a kid but you’re the one that is acting like one!  I can’t believe you are attracted to this kind of look.  They should use girls that look like this to screen for pedophiles on the net and then quarantine and execute all the people who search for the models.  You are supremely sick, Damien.”

Damien doesn’t seem to be listening, his eyes are lost in exploration of your youthful body.  “You’re like my personal cute little princess.  Hehehehe…” [[he deliriously mumbles as he crawls towards you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1159" name="jotted down several relaxation and concentration tips." tags="" position="6683,16949" size="100,100">You keep searching in vain but find nothing that truly stands out… or that you couldn’t have come up with yourself.

You look over your somewhat generic list.   “I don’t know if this will be enough…”  You keep stubbornly searching for several more hours, constantly on the lookout for something tangible that might give you an edge.

Just as you are about to call it quits, you find an interesting link.  “Want to increase mental and physical stamina?” reads an obnoxiously flashing ad.  You mouse over the banner and it switches to an image reading “Hire your personal zen master today!”

You click and it redirects you to a very shitty looking webpage that looks like it was ripped from the Geocities era.

“PersonalZenMaster.com?  “Find enlightenment today?” How about you guys find someone to make you a better website?”  

You doubt you will find anything useful on this page but [[your eyes are drawn to the top of the website.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1160" name="your eyes are drawn to the top of the website." tags="" position="6828,17051" size="100,100">“We have the answers to questions you do not even know to ask!” reads the website’s tagline.

“This reminds me of those TV Psychic shows.  Call in before it is too late!  We have the answers!  Only $12.75 per minute!  What a scam,” you mutter,  You go to exit the page but your cursor passes over a button labelled “testimonials.”

To your surprise, the page is loaded with gushing praise.  //Well, I guess it isn’t like they would advertise the bad results...//

“Personal Zen Master saved my life!  Two years ago I was in a terrible car accident and was left unable to walk and terrified of life.  Now I feel that I have been reborn.  My anxiety has disappeared and I now jog to work every morning!”

“After using PZM’s services for a a few months, I can say with certainty I am now happier, more confident, and in better physical shape now at 67 than I was at 27.”

“PZM helped me get over my crippling fear of approaching women.  Now I am married to a 10/10!”

You read through several dozen of the reviews and come away with mixed feelings.

“This is either the greatest thing ever or a huge scam…”  //Probably 75-25 it is a scam…  But even if there is a small chance it might still be worth it.//  “But I don’t really have money to waste on this either…”  You grin as your eyes land on a small flashing icon.

“Oh!  Sign up and get one session free?  Free is my kind of price!”  You yawn and stretch out, noting the surprisingly late hour.

You accept the “risk free” offer.  A signup page appears and you put in your information, pausing only at the line requesting that you identify your sex.

Your mouse hovers over the button for “male” then to “female” and back again.  “Fuck…  I can’t exactly sign up as a dude and then show up like this, can I?  Ahghh… Whatever!  It shouldn’t matter.”

“Aggghhh… what the fuck?  Then why would you offer it to me?  Okay, that is enough of this!”  You grumpily pull away from your computer and decide to shoot Drew a text before it gets too late.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1163" name="Sign up as a female" tags="" position="5989,17603" size="100,100">To avoid unnecessarily complicated questions, you choose to identify yourself as a woman on the sign up sheet.  //For now at least…  It is just a form!// you tell yourself.

“Congratulations!  You have successfully signed up for a free PZM session!” reads a popup.  You are then directed to a mostly open calendar for the next week.

“I guess I can just pick whatever day is convenient…  I guess the sooner the better, eh?”

You choose tomorrow afternoon for your appointment.  Once the date is selected, another window opens asking you to briefly describe yourself and your PZM goals.

“Uhh…”  You begin to type a somewhat awkward message, describing yourself as a young woman with anxiety problems.  “My goal is to relax, become calmer, and improve my mental and physical strength,” you conclude.

By the time you are finished it is after midnight.  “Shit, I wanted to call Drew!  I guess that will have to wait…”

You drag yourself to bed.  After staring at the ceiling for an hour [[while mulling over your immensely fucked up life, you finally fall asleep.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1164" name="while mulling over your immensely fucked up life, you finally fall asleep." tags="" position="5845,17693" size="100,100">The next morning you send Drew a get well message.

“Hey Drew!  I hope you’re feeling better!  I owe you big time!  I appreciate everything you have done for me… but I have to figure this out on my own.”  You cannot bear the thought of Drew getting hurt again due to your poor decisions.

You head to the address on the PZM website… which leads you to a sketchy looking back alley.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/backalley.jpg&quot;&gt;
You double check the address.  “What the hell?”  You are about to turn back when you spot a small nameplate and a familiar PZM logo.  Beside the nameplate is a steel door and intercom.

//That is some weirdly extensive security...//  “No wonder it was free…  They really need to work on their marketing and do some cosmetic upgrades.”

You feel a bit uneasy but press the intercom button anyway.

“Hello?”

“Hi there!  Welcome to the PZM School!” responds a cheerful voice.

“Uh, hi.  My name is Taylor Roux.  I have an appointment….”

“Come on in!”  A buzzer sounds and the steel doorway unlatches without further inquiry.

[[You push your way inside]] and are surprised that the building’s interior is the complete opposite of the outside.

“It is like a buddhist temple or something in here…”  You eye the elaborate golden statues and strange furnishings with interest.  

“What do you think of our Temple of Relaxation?” rumbles a deep voice from somewhere near the back of the room.

You turn to face the speaker, an enormous muscular man with a faint smirk framing his dark features.  For some odd reason, [[the man is shirtless.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1166" name="the man is shirtless." tags="" position="5837,17869" size="100,100">Despite his slightly greying hair, the Zen master possess a sculpted body that would make many men half his age red with jealousy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/masterpeeshi.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Hello!  Welcome to my school!” he booms.  “I am Master Peeshi, renowned Zen Master of the Fifty Grand Ways!” he introduces himself while striking a comical pose.

The unusual man instantly commands all of your attention.  You feel your nerves fray.  “Uh… nice to meet you, mister Pee….”

“//Master// Pee,” he firmly corrects you.

You almost laugh but manage to keep your composure.  “I am Taylor Roux.  I signed up for a free session last night,” you explain.

“Yes!  Of course!  Right this way, miss Roux.  I definitely think I can help you with your anxiety.”

You follow your host into a smaller room adjacent to the elaborate temple.  [[Once in the confined space, the master breathes in deeply.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1167" name="he deliriously mumbles as he crawls towards you." tags="" position="14581,9534" size="100,100">“I swear to fucking god if you come any closer I will karate chop your damned cock off!” you warn him.

Damien pauses.  “You wouldn’t dare!” he calls your bluff with exaggerated shock as he studies your expression.

“Try me, asshole.”  You raise your small fists into the air.

Instead of being intimidated, Damien chuckles and continues his advance, covering both of your hands with the palm of one of his own.  Although you strain against him, you are powerless to resist.  Damien gently lowers your guard and then begins to [[muzzle at your neck.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1168" name="muzzle at your neck." tags="" position="14728,9632" size="100,100">//Fuck!  I can’t get this big oaf off of me!//

“Damien!  Let me go right now!”

“Mmmm…. No…!  I will never let you go!”

Instead of releasing you, Damien hugs you tighter.  You can now feel Damien’s erection pressing into your thigh.

“No.... Please, Damien…”

Damien, lost in his delerium, continues his actions.  He gropes you for a small eternity.  Damien reverently caresses the skin of your cheek.  Unable to do anything except endure, you squirm in Damien’s arms as he explores your youthful figure.

Just when you are certain things can’t get any worse, Damien [[plants a kiss upon your lips.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1169" name="Taylor Quicksilver" tags="" position="6787,20499" size="100,100">“Wow… No fucking way!  That&#39;s Taylor Quicksilver!”

&quot;Are you a fan of hers?&quot;

&quot;Uh… not of her music per se…  Although I guess that one song is pretty catchy.&quot;

&quot;Ahh, you like to sing?  That will make this assignment a lot easier.&quot;

“I can’t believe Tay QS needs my help…”

The Envoy grins, flashing his pointed teeth.  “Humbling, isn’t it?  Here at the Agency - we change the world!”

“I wouldn&#39;t put it that way.  Still… Taylor is really famous….”  You cough into you hand.   //And I may or may not have fantasized about her previously...//  “I will do everything I can to protect her!” you declare.

The Envoy seems pleased at your enthusiasm.  “Does that mean that you will accept the modchip?”

“Er… I don’t know about that.”

&quot;How else are you going to master five dozen stage routines and two hundred and fifty songs in a weekend?  The implant is fairly non-invasive and it has the benefit of being instant and flawless.&quot;

“Why the fuck do I need a microchip to teach me how to dance?  That is stupid!  Especially if they are limited.  I want to learn kungfu, not how to wiggle on stage.”

“It isn&#39;t stupid, “wiggling” and fighting bothing have their uses.  In this case dancing well is a requirement… it is part of the ploy that the client has requested you use in order to ensnare the potential murderer.  We charge exorbitant fees for these special requests, and she has already paid in full.  You get a cut of this as well.  If you just wing it, it is highly doubtful you will be able to convince our client’s fans … or the potential murderer that you are genuine.  It is also possible you fail the mission and there will be potential consequences that are beyond my control.  [[Learning to sing and dance is absolutely imperative.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1170" name="arichip" tags="" position="5950,20850" size="100,100">&quot;The chip thing is safe?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely!&quot;

&quot;Does it hurt?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely not.&quot;

You stare into the Envoy&#39;s unblinking eyes. He doesn&#39;t appear to be lying, but you&#39;ve never met anyone like him before. //This is either going to be one of the best or worst moments of my life,// you predict.  &quot;Fine. Give me the chip.&quot;

The Envoy claps his hands in delight. &quot;Excellent! Your survival rate will definitely improve!&quot; he jokes with a pointy-toothed smile.

//I don&#39;t really want to dance or sing but the other skills might be pretty useful.// It feels a bit like cheating to have a chip take the place of hard work but shortcuts save time. You hear your father&#39;s voice echo unbidden through your mind, &quot;nothing is free.&quot;

The Envoy unzips a small fanny pack, revealing a giant syringe.

&quot;Whoa, wait a second! You&#39;re going to do this //here!?// In the park!?&quot;

&quot;There is no time like the present and no place more sterile than that which dwells under the light of the sun,&quot; the Envoy remarks.

&quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Taylor!  You will only feel a little //pinch,//&quot; the Envoy assure you as he loads his giant syringe gun with a tiny capsule. The Envoy holds out a pocket mirror.  &quot;If you would like to observe,&quot; he explains.

//I am really regretting my life choices right now...//

You shake your head.  &quot;No thanks. I don&#39;t want to see.&quot;

The Envoy shrugs and motions for you to brace yourself. You close your eyes, unwilling to witness the large syringe descend into your flesh.  You do indeed feel a slight pinch… and then nothing until [[the modchip begins to stimulate your brain.|arichipstart]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1171" name="Learning to sing and dance is absolutely imperative.”" tags="" position="6631,20557" size="100,100">
“I somehow doubt that.  No one will give a shit if I can’t dance as long as I am hot… trust me, I know the internet!  And what, have you never heard of lip syncing?”

The Envoy frowns.  “Your performance on this mission will be closely watched, not just by us but by your client&#39;s rabid fans.  It is possible you could get into serious trouble.  Taylor, you //must// succeed and make a convincing impression.”

&quot;I will do my best.&quot;

“Mr. Roux, I //highly// recommend getting the upgrade.  This mission could be very dangerous and without it you or your client could get injured or killed.  If you get the chip, your imitation will be flawless, of that I am sure.  Of course, it is your choice but I would have grave concerns about your safety and potential survivability if you rely on the standard courses.  Believe me, I have your best interests at heart!  Frankly, it would take years to train you properly.  Yet we only have a mere weekend… anything you learn will be, at best, superficial.  Who knows what you will be up against?  I would urge you not to half ass this.”

The Envoy makes excellent points.  Still, the idea of having a chip implanted in your brain is not only super creepy, but also a risk in and of itself.  //Hmm… but it might well be the less risky alternative.  I don’t want to fucking die… or screw up this mission…. Or get a brain implant.  The Envoy says there is no side effects but can I really trust this guy?  Still, some of the other skills sound useful.… and if I become a badass in the process, how the fuck could I turn that chance down?  I have always dreamed of kicking a bit of ass!  So what if I might have it shake mine a bit too...//

The sensation reminds you of the sensation of a suddenly recalled memory only in infinitely greater quantity and detail.  

After a few minutes you begin to feel sleepy.  After a few more, you fall asleep on the bench.

When next you wake, you feel refreshed but a bit uncomfortable.  You now have a dull pain behind your right ear along with a slightly different world view.

You can immediately sense that something is off.  //I feel different somehow...//.  &quot;How long was I out for?&quot; you mumble.

&quot;Just a few minutes!&quot; the Envoy answers from your side.

&quot;Wait…  I remember!  It is all here!&quot;  You make a fist and a torrent of self defense images flash through your mind.  &quot;This is amazing…&quot;

You feel like you have an endless reservoir of information and energy to draw upon.

&quot;What was… Natalie… What was //I// doing in 2005?&quot;  After a slight, painless buzz the answer pops into your head.  &quot;I was… I mean //Natalie// was on vacation in Barcelona!  This is pretty cool actually!&quot;

The Envoy watches your awakening with amusement.  &quot;Excellent.  Shall we go meet our client?&quot; the Envoy asks you with a sharp-toothed grin.

The two of you drive in awkward silence.  You park outside a luxurious apartment complex a few blocks away.  

You raise an eyebrow.  &quot;Natalie is //here?//  Shouldn&#39;t she be in like Hollywood or something?&quot;

&quot;Ms. Prynn is attempting to &quot;lay low.&quot;  This is a task that is difficult for such a high profile beauty.  She is also concerned about her safety given the, ahem, circumstances.&quot;

&quot;Huh?  Oh!  She&#39;s so gorgeous…&quot;

&quot;Use that picture to focus,&quot; instructs the Envoy.  &quot;Start to visualize, or whatever it is that you do.  Time&#39;s a-wastin&#39;!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t say I feel comfortable about doing this.&quot;

&quot;Oh please.  Don&#39;t get cold feet now.  You&#39;re already a beautiful young woman.  Such a transformation is a minor thing.  It is for a good cause.&quot;

&quot;I guess that is kind of true…&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to be Natalie&#39;s hero?&quot; the Envoy goads you.

You stare at the photograph, willing yourself to become her reflection.  You feel the strange icy-hot tingle return and spread across your sensitive, goose pimpled flesh.

You wordlessly accept a compact mirror from the Envoy and use it to subtly alter your features, switching your concentration back and forth between the images [[until you cannot distinguish any difference between yourself and the woman in the photograph.]]

&quot;Absolutely astonishing.  I think the Agency has struck gold.  You, Mr. Roux… you are //gold// and we shall forge you into art!&quot;

You glance down at the picture.  &quot;But still… //Natalie Prynn//…  This babe is a knockout!  Everyone loves her!&quot;  And now you get to //be// her… at least for a while.  You aren&#39;t sure how that makes you feel.  &quot;Who would want to hurt such a sweet lady?&quot; you ask the Envoy. 

You recall Ms. Prynn supports numerous charities and philanthropic organizations.  It seems unlikely she would have any significant enemies.  //Still, I guess any rich, famous person has probably stepped on a few toes…  Plus, I suppose I don&#39;t really know what Natalie is really like in person.  She is an actress so she could be a psycho hiding in plain sight for all I know.//

&quot;That is for you to ascertain.  It could be a stalker… Or aliens. Or perhaps something more sinister,&quot; the Envoy speculates.  [[&quot;Keep a lookout, Taylor!&quot;]] he advises.

You are the most convincing lookalike I have ever seen!&quot; she remarks.  &quot;We are like identical twins!  Are you my long lost sister, separated at birth?&quot; Natalie teases you.

&quot;Uh, no, I don&#39;t think so…&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;m Natalie… but I guess you already knew that!&quot;

&quot;Yep.  I am here to protect you.&quot;

&quot;I feel safer already!&quot; Natalie replies with a cute laugh that nearly makes you swoon on the spot.

Natalie continues to stare at you.  She seems more than impressed with the detail of your transformation.  &quot;Wow…  You look exactly like me.  I have a few lookalikes out there but this is just out of this world.&quot;

&quot;What are those guys doing?&quot; you wonder aloud, nodding at two men nearby using ladders.

&quot;We have spent a fortune upgrading security but I still feel uneasy…  Somehow these //threats// keep breaking through,&quot; [[she complains.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1180" name="she complains." tags="" position="7394,21445" size="100,100">You have a sudden urge to ask pointed questions.  &quot;Yeah, I heard you had some break ins.  What can you tell me about those?&quot;

Natalie&#39;s smile vanishes.  &quot;Not much to tell really.  Someone broke in, grabbed a few random items and ran off.  The police are useless!  It isn&#39;t the first time something like this has happened but the incidents are becoming more common… and more brazen.  I am terrified to leave the house most days.&quot;  Natalie glances around.  &quot;Just between us girls, I am a bit worried some pervert is going to steal my underwear.  Maybe I should get another guard….&quot; the young actress taps her lip thoughtfully.  &quot;I now have contracted security guarding me twenty four seven but I confess that I still do not feel safe, hence the extra precautions like yourself.&quot;

&quot;I see.  You should be secure within the apartment itself but it is always a good idea to stay on guard.  As I said, I will do everything I can to keep you safe.  What about your private security?  Are they from the Agency?&quot;

&quot;I have fourteen guards from three different security companies counting yourself.  Two of the fourteen are also your comrades from the Agency.&quot;

//Well, they aren&#39;t really my comrades…  They are probably rivals as well!//  You open your mouth to explain to Natalie that this only your first mission but you think better of it at the last second.

&quot;Oh!  I should introduce you to Pierre.  C&#39;mon Taylor…// Prynn//, follow me!&quot;  Natalie leads you inside her [[shockingly spacious apartment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1181" name="shockingly spacious apartment." tags="" position="7538,21543" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natapart.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
&quot;Wow, what a nice place!&quot; you comment.

&quot;Yeah, I have like ten more of these but I like this one too, it&#39;s kind of small and cute!&quot;

//This place is huge… I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.  Natalie is almost as rich as she is smokin&#39; hot!//

[[&quot;Come with me, Taylor. I think I can hear Pierre in the kitchen!&quot;]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1182" name="I can&#39;t say I like the idea of being the bait..." tags="" position="7543,21699" size="100,100">&quot;Well you probably want to have a look around before turning in for the night.  We have a big day tomorrow!&quot; Natalie says to you.  The beautiful actress and Pierre begin to whisper to each other.  You decide to give them some privacy.  You leave the couple and begin to wander around the apartment.

After getting a general sense of the apartment layout, you head out onto its attached balcony.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/agent29.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
When you step outside a man in a suit rushes up to you.  &quot;Ms. Prynn!  You shouldn&#39;t be out unescorted!&quot; he objects.

&quot;Natalie is safe,&quot; you reply.  

&quot;How can you be… She is…?  But you are… Oh….&quot;  The man&#39;s eyes narrow as he studies your face.  &quot;We did receive word there was a body double arriving but… wow, the resemblance is just uncanny!  I doubt I could tell you two apart.&quot;

&quot;That is kind of the whole point I think.&quot;

[[&quot;Geez.  How did they not offer you a multi million dollar porn contract?&quot;]] he asks you point blank.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1183" name="Once in the confined space, the master breathes in deeply." tags="" position="5986,17902" size="100,100">“Hoo… Your perfume is lovely,” the Zen Master comments as he seals you inside the chamber.

The man’s words make you a bit uncomfortable.  “I don’t wear perfume…”

Master Pee ignores you.  “Let’s practice some meditation techniques.  Sit with me.”  You follow his instructions and lower yourself onto a nearby mat.   “Now close your eyes and just //breathe,//” Peeshi instructs.  “Yes, good!  Follow my lead.  In and out - let your lungs expand to their limit and then yes, just like that, exhale… Perfect…”

The world around you goes dark as you close your eyes.  You figure you might as well take this training seriously.  You might even learn something valuable in the process.

You attempt to relax and practice breathing exercises.  Although it is difficult, you gradually find your steady, deep breaths to have a calming effect.

“Ahhepp!” you yelp when you suddenly feel hands around your waist.  You had not heard Peeshi move.

“No, no,” Peeshi chides you.  “You must allow yourself to fall into a deeper meditative trance to accomplish anything worthwhile.  You will always be nervous until you master yourself.  You must detach yourself from the //flow// of this world and attach your mind to a plane of higher benefit.  You don’t want to be reincarnated as a fly!” he warns you.  “You should not react to //anything// once you are in proper meditation form.  You must //concentrate// and then //release// yourself.  You will not react to stimuli in this world any longer because you will not dwell on the same level as these petty distractions.”

You mull over the man’s words for a moment.  Upon closer inspection, they don’t appear //quite// as crazy as they did on the first utterance.  You lock eyes with the Zen Master and decide that compliance would be more productive than arguing.  With a sigh, you again close your eyes.

[[After a few minutes your mind begins to drift.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1184" name="After a few minutes your mind begins to drift." tags="" position="5840,18008" size="100,100">
You forget where you are.  You start to daydream about cats...

//Snap-CRACK!!//  A loud noise rings out behind you, startling you and snapping you back to reality.  

“What the hell!?”

“Concentrate!” Peeshi hisses at you.  He slaps you lightly just below the shoulder with something that feels like a leather strap.  “Close your eyes and concentrate,” he adds in a dispassionate tone.

//Fucking asshole.  How can I concentrate if he keeps distracting me?//

You take a deep breath and try to slip into a meditative trance.

Just when you begin to feel calm, Peeshi again interrupts you.  “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” he screams in your ear and you flinch.  “Tsk tsk…  You need a lot of work, Taylor.  Here let us try burning some incense.  It often helps produce a [[state of calm and well being.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1185" name="You notice an alert on your phone." tags="" position="4244,10868" size="100,100">It seems that Sandra has sent you another email.  It reads: &quot;If you can get Craig to do his school work big bonus in it for you! &lt;3&quot;

//Big bonus, eh?  I like the sound of that!//  &quot;Don&#39;t you have homework or something to do?&quot; you ask Craig.  You are aware Craig is a few years behind on his schooling for obvious reasons.

Craig shakes his head.  &quot;I don&#39;t have to do it anymore because I am special.  Video games are way better!&quot; he opines. 

&quot;I think you should do some school work.  Got to exercise your brain as well as your thumbs.  I will help you out.  How does that sound?&quot;

&quot;Bad.  I want to play games with you instead,&quot; Craig insists.

&quot;That isn&#39;t a very good attitude.&quot;

&quot;L-let&#39;s play for it!&quot;

&quot;Play for what?&quot;

&quot;If you win I will do anything you want,&quot; Craig announces.

//But I suppose that would hold true for me as well…  These are big stakes but I am awesome at fighting games and Craig isn&#39;t exactly what I would call &quot;coordinated.&quot;  There is no way I could lose to him!//  You and Drew have prepared for these circumstances for far too many years for the prospect of a game tournament to shake you. &quot;So if I win--you will study and behave?&quot;

Craig goes silent for an uncomfortably long time.  &quot;Do I have to for the whole t-time?  All night?&quot;

“Of course!”

Craig grimaces but finally nods along.  &quot;I accept the challenge!&quot; he says.  The two of you return to Craig&#39;s room, juice in hand.  The young man waddles over to the TV and [[starts the game system.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1186" name="starts the game system." tags="" position="4392,10958" size="100,100">For some unknown reason, perhaps for immersive purposes, he makes you watch the game&#39;s entire intro video, replete with explosions, screaming, and hordes of attackers being beaten by weird looking fighters.

Most of the game characters make their ass kicking debut.  There are many different styles represented from karate masters to vicious catgirls.

Many of the fighters are unique looking and you note several that stand out including a massive balloon shaped monk and a warrior made of glowing rainbow fire.  

You recognize a cheap long legged fighter from a meme. You recall his playstyle is hard to beat and very unbalanced… but not much fun.  If you were playing with Drew, both of you would probably agree not to use his overpowered ass unless it was a mirror match up.

Craig seems to be waiting for you to make your choice.  Which character should you choose?

[[Choose your personal best fighter]]
[[Choose an agile character]]
[[Choose a random fighter]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1187" name="Choose your personal best fighter" tags="" position="4194,11160" size="100,100">You chose your best character.  //Or rather the one I am most familiar with...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/balanced fighter.jpg&quot;&gt;
Your fighter is well balanced and you have a good handle on his moves.  As long as you put a bit of effort into things you are certain in your victory.

In response to your choice Craig picks a giant fatass monk character that resembles an inflated balloon.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/monkfighter.jpg&quot;&gt;

[[You begin to duel against Craig.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1188" name="Choose an agile character" tags="" position="4392,11164" size="100,100">You pick an agile character, a fearsome cat girl named Mel.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/catfight.jpg&quot;&gt;
With her high speed and ferocious jumping attacks you expect the match will be decided by the accuracy of your pounce attacks.  //And if all else fails Mel has claws… heh.//

In response to your choice, Craig chooses a stunning redhead woman.  Judging by her build, you bet she has a similar profile to your own choice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/agilefighter.jpg&quot;&gt;

[[You begin the match against Craig.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1189" name="Choose a random fighter" tags="" position="4586,11160" size="100,100">Because you are confident in your gaming skills and aware of Craig&#39;s lack of hand-eye coordination, you decide to give him a handicap.  You choose a random character.

Craig bites his lip as you lock in your choice.  //Heh, he won&#39;t know which counter to pick since I am random!//

After a moment of flipping his selection cursor around the screen Craig decides on a balanced fighter.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/balanced fighter.jpg&quot;&gt;

//Shit that was who I was going to pick…  Oh well.//  You offer a prayer to the random number generator as Craig locks in the selection and the [[match begins.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1190" name="match begins." tags="" position="4734,11210" size="100,100">You have rolled a character you have never seen in action let alone played.  Your fighter appears to be some sort of witch that uses her staff as a broomstick to both levitate and fight.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/randommage.jpg&quot;&gt;

You grit your teeth.  This is clearly an expert level character with high speed and attack that will require a high level of skill and timing.  //If I knew the moves, maybe….//  You momentarily curse your arrogance for selecting a random character.

//Ding!// The match begins.

//I definitely can&#39;t lose this!  My best chance is to...//

[[Go all out with aggressive attacks]]
[[Play defensively and wait for an opportunity to strike.]]
[[Try to use a cheese strategy]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1191" name="Go all out with aggressive attacks" tags="" position="4992,11352" size="100,100">Since your character leans towards offense, you decide to press your advantage.  Without fully understanding the witch&#39;s moves, you shoot forward and begin attacking Craig.  You mash buttons and push him desperately back into a corner.

At first your efforts seem to be effective until Craig manages to get up and push you back with a few well timed counters.

You each return to the edges of the map.  With a glance at the health bars, hugely in your favor, you rush back and continue your assault.

You smash your staff into Craig&#39;s face and then sweep his legs with it.  Once he is on the ground your petite character begins to pummel his into the ground.

After a brutal beating, Craig manages to recover and the two of you resume your tepid face off.  The stats are hugely in your favor at the moment so you decide to:

[[Push your momentum and end the game]]
[[Wait patiently for an opportunity to strike.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1192" name="Play defensively and wait for an opportunity to strike." tags="" position="4842,11356" size="100,100">Since you are unfamiliar with your character&#39;s moves, you opt for a defensive strategy.

You quickly regret your choice when Craig responds to your passivity with unbridled aggression.

Craig launches an impressive barrage of alternating combos.

You manage to survive and strike back a few times but take immense damage in the process.

You grit your teeth as you reverse your gameplan, striking as quickly and aggressively as possible.  Yet the gap between your hp bars is already too large.

After a desperate retreating battle, [[you finally succumb to Craig&#39;s assault.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1193" name="Try to use a cheese strategy" tags="" position="4688,11356" size="100,100">Given your character&#39;s mobility, you imagine that you might be able to do a series of attacks in a cheap manner.

Your plan backfires spectacularly.  As you attempt to launch a sequence of ranged attacks, Craig merely closes the gap and lands several good hits.

You dance around and put some more distance between your opponent. You then continue your cheese barrage but the rapid weak attacks do little to wear down Craig&#39;s hp.

Your attempts to skirt around the edge of the map also allows Craig to easily read your moves.

Even though you manage to get a few decent licks in, Craig soon corners you and [[kicks your ass.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1194" name="Push your momentum and end the game" tags="" position="5189,11502" size="100,100">Your strategy has clearly been effective so you decide not to change it.  You fly forward and begin poking Craig&#39;s constantly defending character.

Your enemy deflects your first few attacks but your push in deeper and land a satisfying strike.  //I got you now, Craig!// you exult in a moment of triumph.  Except your glee is cut short when Craig&#39;s character steps forth and grabs your character and launches a devastating combo right into your little witch&#39;s face.

//Uh oh.//  You watch in horror as your slender mage is repeatedly body slammed into the ground. 

You just barely manage to break out of the loop just in time to eat Craig&#39;s special attack.  The two of you hop back to your corners with both health bars and the timer flashing red.

//Fuuuuck!//  You can&#39;t believe how close the match is.  You begin sweating profusely as the final seconds tick down.

[[Launch a glorious charge!]]
[[Ride out the clock]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1195" name="Wait patiently for an opportunity to strike." tags="" position="4999,11606" size="100,100">You decide to bide your time.  You experiment with different button combinations and discover an extra powerful staff charge move.

Craig seems frustrated as you dart away from him at every opportunity.

After a minute of playing tag Craig turns to you.  &quot;Stop running!&quot; he hisses at you.

&quot;Okay, Craig,&quot; you respond.  The next moment you execute your charge combo and spear Craig&#39;s fighter into a wall.

&quot;Noooo!&quot; Craig howls as you proceed to beat the ever living shit out of him.

&quot;I win; you lose,&quot; you inform Craig with a yawn.

He seems demoralized by your sudden victory and [[doesn&#39;t even bother to request a rematch.|The rest of the night passes uneventfully]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1196" name="Launch a glorious charge!" tags="" position="5134,11708" size="100,100">Your surging adrenaline makes you bold.  You zoom forward, floating upwards in a feint before dropping to ground level and executing your character&#39;s dash charge attack.

&quot;Noooo!&quot; Craig wails as your staff pierce&#39;s into his fighter&#39;s stomach and blows him back into a nearby rock.

His hp drops to zero while your witch hops onto her floating staff.  She raises her hands in a show of victory.

&quot;Yesss!!  I did it!  I kicked your ass, Craig.  Now do your fucking homework.&quot;

Craig slumps over in defeat.  &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; he mumbles, clearly amazed at your video game prowess.

[[The rest of the night passes uneventfully]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1197" name="Ride out the clock" tags="" position="5296,11664" size="100,100">You hover around the maps edges and dodge Craig when he advances.  A few seconds later the match is over.

&quot;You lose,&quot; Craig announces with a grin.  You cringe as Craig&#39;s fighter does an obscene victory pose.

&quot;What?!  It was a //tie!//&quot; you object

&quot;No it wasn&#39;t, I had like 2% more hp than you.  I won fair and square.&quot;  Craig gestures at the victory screen, clearly denoting the winner.

[[&quot;No way.  I lost?  That just isn&#39;t possible.  Best two out of three?&quot; you suggest.]]

&quot;H-hey!  That&#39;s cheating!&quot;

&quot;No it isn&#39;t!  Hoooooooooraaaaaaaah!&quot;  You continue your desperate assault.  Soon you have Craig on the backfoot.  You refuse to let up, pummelling Craig&#39;s fighter into submission.

Craig is one feather tickle away from death.  You wind up for the last hit… and Craig swats the controller out of your hand in real life.

&quot;What the hell?&quot;

You scramble forward to grab the controller but by the time you have it hand you have already been defeated.

&quot;You cheated, Craig!&quot;

&quot;No, //you// cheated.  You were trying to distract me.&quot;

&quot;That isn&#39;t true.&quot;

&quot;I won fair and square.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say fair and square…&quot; you drily object.  //Fuck, the last thing I want is to be in debt to Craig.  I don&#39;t want to be paying out jelly bean tribute for the rest of my life...//

Fear grips your body as your eyes meet those of your ward.  Craig now has an absolutely demented looking grin plastered across his face.  //I have a really bad feeling about this...// 

You swallow nervously.  &quot;So, you want me to buy you pizza or something?&quot; you venture hopefully.

“Pizza?  No!  I get that everyday.  I want something better.&quot;

//What is better than pizza?// you wonder.

&quot;I want to see your boobs,” Craig bluntly informs you of his request without any further time to think it over.

You balk and barely resist the urge to punch him in the stomach.  &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?  I will do something for you like buy you a damned video game, not let you feel me up.  You little pervert!  It was a fucking video game, not a slave contract!&quot;

Craig seems disappointed in your reaction.  &quot;You said you would do &quot;anything I want,&quot; and this is what I want,&quot; he stubbornly insists.  //I didn&#39;t say that...//  &quot;I thought you seemed l-like an honest person.

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful… and I won… so why are you so mean?  Why won&#39;t you show me?  All beautiful women are //mean!//&quot; Craig shrieks out a succession of questions.

You raise your hands to mollify him as you would a small child.  &quot;Craig, it isn&#39;t right…  That isn&#39;t a polite thing to request,&quot; you attempt to explain.  &quot;We just met… I am not into guys.  And you&#39;re kind of… uh…&quot; you trail off, unwilling to hurt his feelings.

Craig begins to cry.  &quot;I don&#39;t care!  Please just show me!&quot; he yells at you with tears streaming down his face.  &quot;Don&#39;t be a liar,&quot; he adds.

You stare into Craig&#39;s tearful eyes and feel nothing but pity.  //I guess I can kind of relate…  Although, of course I was never this pathetic.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1209" name="Let Craig come to you" tags="" position="4190,11316" size="100,100">You stop in the center of the arena and wait patiently for Craig&#39;s monk to waddle forward.  Craig seems to sense your intent, and attempts to speed around the edge of the map in an attempt to find a good angle to attack you.

You stubbornly stand your ground.

Instead of reciting the moves for a flashy, complicated combination attack, your thumb hovers over the button for //grab.//

When Craig finally attacks he gets a surprise.  He was clearly expecting you to go for a wild haymaker, instead he awkwardly dodges a nonexistent attack, right into your character&#39;s muscled arms.

//Yoink.// 

Your character grabs and lifts the comically large monk fighter.

&quot;Nooooo!&quot; Craig wails as you give his monk the beating of a lifetime.

When Craig notices that you didn&#39;t take a single hit in the battle he goes silent.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to play this anymore,&quot; he pouts.

&quot;Study time?&quot; you suggest with an evil grin.

When Craig enters your zone of control, you leap right at him, claws barred.

The two of you collide in mid air and Craig somehow manages to grab you and toss you down.

You leap away and aggressively poke away at Craig, launching numerous hit and run attacks.

Craig resolutely stands his ground, patiently countering and grabbing you when you stray too close.

You land a few decent hits but soon find yourself trailing in HP.

You are surprised when the match ends and Craig receives the victory for having the greatest amount of life.

&quot;Shit!  I lost track there for a second.  Damn…  So, uh, best two out of three?&quot; you suggest.

&quot;Deal.&quot;

The rematch begins and you redouble your efforts, striking as quickly as you can button mash.

You lose in half the time during the second fight.

&quot;How the fuck did that just happen?&quot; you idly wonder.

[[You have been defeated by Craig]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1212" name="Be patient" tags="" position="4339,11461" size="100,100">You choose to play it safe and be as patient as possible.  You have never been known for you impulse control but you suspect you have Craig firmly outclassed in this area.  You use your exceptional mobility and jumping skills to avoid taking much damage for the first part of the match.  With every annoyingly close dodge, Craig&#39;s attacks become increasingly reckless.

Your cat girl crushes Craig&#39;s balanced fighter with nearly full hp.

&quot;Did you want to have another round?&quot; you innocently ask Craig.

Craig slumps over.  &quot;No, I hate this game.  You win.&quot;  

&quot;Alright then!  Study time!&quot;

&quot;No!  Wait!  I will do another round instead!&quot;

&quot;Tough luck.  You have already conceded defeat.  Now do your fucking homework.&quot;

&quot;Girls aren&#39;t supposed to swear,&quot; Craig mumbles.

&quot;I am obviously not a typical girl…  And girls can swear if they fuckin&#39; want to.&quot;

&quot;You kind of remind me of someone…&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;Nothing…&quot;

On the other side of the balcony you spot a gorgeous young woman sitting beside a humongous rifle that looks like it fires anti-tank shells instead of bullets.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/agent12.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
As you approach the intimidating woman, her head swivels in your direction.  You are caught off guard by her bright eyes and unusual irises, shining like cold chips of pale blue ice.  You feel a chill run down your spine and it takes you a brief moment to collect yourself enough to speak.

&quot;Hello.  My name is Taylor.  I am serving as Natalie&#39;s body double,&quot; you introduce yourself.

The woman yawns as if you are boring her.  &quot;Well it was plain you aren&#39;t Natalie.  The way you walk and talk is off.  You carry yourself like a mouse,&quot; she brusquely comments.  &quot;I am surprised you let them do that to you.  Just disgusting.  Don&#39;t you have any pride?&quot;

The woman&#39;s tone makes you defensive.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You let them change you into Natalie.  Gross.  You&#39;re obviously someone with low self worth.  Wanting to change into someone else?  Pfft…  I can only imagine how painful the surgery and recovery must have been.  I hope you are getting well compensated for this //degeneracy.//&quot;

&quot;None of your business,&quot; you reply.  You can&#39;t help but let a bit of anger slip into your reply.

Agent Twelve raises an eyebrow.  &quot;So you&#39;re saying that you were born looking like that?&quot;

&quot;Uhhhh… not exactly…&quot;

&quot;Well, spit it out then.  What&#39;s your secret?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have to explain myself to you,&quot; you reply as evenly as possible.

&quot;Hm.  Let me guess… maybe you just have //a talent for impersonation//?&quot;

Twelve&#39;s guess hits a little bit too close to the mark for comfort.  &quot;Something like that.  I have to go.  I want to check out the rest of this place before I turn in.&quot;

Before Twelve can annoy you any further, [[you head back into the apartment.]]

Maybe you are slightly less of a piece of trash than you appear,&quot; the agentthoughtfully remarks.

&quot;Uhh… thanks?&quot;

&quot;I am Agent Twelve.  You can call me Twelve or my callsign is &quot;J&quot; on the commlink.  I am on long range support though, so don&#39;t ask for help unless you really need it.  Actually, now that I think about it, if you die it increases our danger pay, so maybe get on that, would ya?&quot;

//Great.  So my backup is a pervert and Ms. Crazy-Ice-Eyes who thinks I am more valuable  dead.//

You sigh, suddenly feeling overwhelmed with the sheer insanity of your circumstances.  //My life was going great!  I was on my way to a new year of school… Then everything got derailed… and now I feel like I am crossdressing in Natalie fucking Prynn&#39;s apartment!//  You imagine living out a million different lifetimes.  //Yep, nothing this fucked up would ever happen!//

As you turn to leave, Agent Twelve calls after you, &quot;Oh and a friendly warning: watch out for that Matt guy.  He&#39;s a big creep.  I had to kick him in the balls earlier.&quot;

Your curiosity gets the best of you.  You walk up to the laundry room door and knock.

The door opens.  Inside is a guard and a young man sitting at a large computer setup.  &quot;Ah, Natalie!  I just completed a check.  Everything looks good,&quot; he informs you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/securityexpert.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&quot;That&#39;s good.  Except Natalie is right there,&quot; you answer, pointing to one of the nearby security monitors showing Natalie and Pierre in the living room.

&quot;Huh!?  What in the name of…?&quot;

&quot;I am Taylor.  I am with the Agency,&quot; you explain.

The man at the computer frowns.  &quot;You Agency people keep stealing all the good work,&quot; he pouts.  &quot;Although, clearly you are unique.  In all my years in this field I have never seen a body double, let alone a completely identical body double.&quot;

&quot;Uh, I guess I am just…. Lucky?&quot;

&quot;That you are.  Natalie is a goddess and you are her spitting image.   I am Dwayne Krashnev of Quantum Security.  Nice to meet you.&quot;

You trade small talk with Dwayne for a few minutes until you notice Natalie and Pierre are heading to bed.

&quot;No cameras in the bedrooms of course,&quot; Dwayne explains.  [[&quot;There are also guest rooms on the east side for security personnel.&quot;]]

You thank Dwayne and head to a guest room to retire.  You lie down an unfamiliar bed.  Sleep is elusive, chased off by your brain&#39;s frantic effort to come to terms with the events of the day.

When next you open your eyes, it is already light outside.

Natalie Prynn&#39;s reflection greets you in the mirror. //I was so exhausted I forgot to change back... oh well.//

&quot;Well, time to start my first day as Natalie…&quot;

You fight off your nervousness and head out into the kitchen, [[where you and Natalie have breakfast with Pierre.]]

After breakfast Natalie turns her smartphone towards you.  On today&#39;s calendar are listed three events.

&quot;We will each do one and cancel the third,&quot; she informs you.

&quot;Are you comfortable with me… you know… going out like this?  What if I have to talk to someone?&quot;

Natalie shrugs.  &quot;Then talk.  Just don&#39;t do anything that I wouldn&#39;t.  It is actually pretty easy being me, minus all the great acting of course!  The Agency said you are an impersonation expert that has studied my work.  You have already impressed me!  I think it will be kind of fun to see if anyone notices.  If they don&#39;t, I might have to offer you a buyout and keep you for myself.&quot;

You swallow nervously.  //Did Natalie Prynn just offer to… buy me?  Yikes….//

&quot;So, which do you want to go to?&quot; Natalie prompts you.  &quot;I suppose I should go to the film set though, unless you are really confident in your &quot;acting&quot; skills.  I don&#39;t really want you to make a big scene on your first day.  Hmm, still, it might be good to mix up my appearances for security reasons.&quot;

You decide to:
[[Go to the film set]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1220" name="Go to the photo shoot" tags="" position="7547,22655" size="100,100">You decide that going to the photo shoot is the least risky choice.  //At least I don&#39;t have to talk…  I will just let Natalie&#39;s smokin&#39; body do the work for me!//

&quot;I will go to the photo shoot if that&#39;s alright,&quot; you answer Natalie while looking away in a bad attempt to hide your scarlet face.

Natalie nods thoughtfully and then shoots you a mercurial smile.  &quot;Oooo, want to play dress-up?  No problem.  I trust you… just don&#39;t do anything that I wouldn&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

You leave before Natalie can embarrass you any further.  

You head downstairs and board a waiting car. [[You then drive to the photographer&#39;s studio.]]

Natalie seems surprised… and a bit worried…  Her large brown eyes dart around thoughtfully as she thinks over your offer.  &quot;It should be a light day so I suppose it is alright,&quot; your host decides.  &quot;My scenes aren&#39;t scheduled until next week.  Are you sure you will be okay?  The director is a bit eccentric...&quot;

&quot;As long as they don&#39;t expect me to have any lines memorized.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, no you should be okay.  I was mainly going to observe and maybe snap a few behind the scenes tidbits.  I wanted to talk to the director about my costume for a bit too but I suppose that can wait.  Remember: don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t and call me if you need anything.&quot;

You pose as Natalie, entering a sedan with tinted windows that is flanked by two escorts.  &quot;Good morning Natalie!&quot; one of them greets you.

&quot;Ms. Prynn!&quot; the other says with a nod.

&quot;Morning fellas!&quot; you reply.  The guards are none the wiser that they are escorting an imposter.

You drive to a remote location outside your city.  //I guess they make movies anywhere nowadays...//

//Uh oh.  That doesn&#39;t sound good.  Is this guy the director?//

&quot;Quickly!  Get to the changing room.  I already have everything set up.  All we need is our star!&quot;

//Well damn, I guess I always wanted to be in a movie...//

&quot;I am sure you are fully prepared!&quot; he continues.  The director ushers you into a nearby room.  Inside is an asian lady standing next to a makeup table and a line of costumes.

&quot;I have your costume ready for you Natalie,&quot; the young woman informs you.

&quot;My costume?  What cost--&quot;  You wince as the answer to your question buzzes into your mind.  //I am filming a fantasy movie!//

You accept the costume from the woman and feel sick to your stomach when you realize how much cleavage it will likely show.  //And now I have to perform… Millions of people will see this--er me!  This is going to be embarrassing… At least my name won&#39;t be on the credits.//

You suddenly feel nervous.  You aren&#39;t an award winning actress.  //I am a transformed spy in training!//

&quot;I can do this!&quot;  //Fuck, no I can&#39;t!  I have to get out of here!//

You look down at the costume and a surge of regrets wash over you.  You take a deep breath and then:

Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?&quot;  Without waiting for a response, he gestures at the set.  &quot;Shall we get all the tiresome dialogue out of the way?

&quot;I just really wanted to be thorough so that I can give my best possible performance,&quot; you explain.

&quot;All I have to do is kick this guy in the face?&quot; you muse, glancing at the poor actor meant to be on the receiving end of your blows.  //No problem!//  Without further instruction, you snap your leg out and strike the prone man right in the face.

&quot;My… panties?&quot;  //Who the fuck does this guy think he is?//

Craig waits impatiently as you debate your next actions.  //Well I have already crossed the line...//

&quot;Please Tammy... I might never get to see a real live girl&#39;s panties... and certainly not one that looks like you.  Please just show me one more thing and then I will know that you are as honorable as you are beautiful!&quot;

&quot;For fuck&#39;s sake...&quot;
[[Show Craig your panties.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1237" name="Show Craig your panties." tags="" position="4786,12756" size="100,100">You fumble with your pants and kick them off while Craig watches.

//Aghh!  Fuck!  Why am I in my underwear in front of Craig!?  No defeat is worth this humiliation...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taycraigpose2.jpg&quot;&gt;
Craig&#39;s eyes bulge to double their normal size.  &quot;Oh my… so… //cute//,&quot; he mumbles.

You realize that you need to take efforts to end this nightmare before it gets out of hand.

&quot;Okay Craig!  That is it.  You got your wish.  Now let&#39;s just watch a movie or something for the rest of the night…&quot;

&quot;Wait!  Just… one more thing.  PLEASE!&quot;

You feel uneasy.  //I have a bad feeling about this….//

&quot;I just showed you my panties!  Stop moving the goalposts, kid.&quot;

&quot;Hear my request.&quot;

&quot;Fine, go ahead.&quot;

&quot;Please show me your beautiful boobs!&quot; Craig shouts his request so loudly you fear the neighbours might hear.

//I knew it...//

Craig bites his lip but readily agrees.

//Fuck my life...// you think as you unclip your bra.

//Ugh… I doubt either of us will forget this anytime soon...//

You refuse Craig and grab your clothes.  After dressing, you wait for Sandra in the kitchen while Craig hides in his room…

&quot;Hckkk……Hnnnngggghh…  Zssshhaaa….&quot; Craig groans and hisses.  You can&#39;t help but smile as you appraise the effect of your boobs.  //Yeah, pretty much as expected...//  Your smile quickly fades as Craig stares at you.  He eyefucks with such intensifty it soon makes your skin crawl.

After about thirty seconds of blushing under his gaze, you grab your shirt.

[[&quot;I want to see more!&quot;]] Craig yells as you cover yourself.

Craig licks his lips nervously.  &quot;I-I want to see between your legs.&quot;

You balk.  A vein in your forehead begins to twitch menacingly.  &quot;And I want a million dollars and fucking immortality!&quot; you rage.  &quot;You don&#39;t always get what you want, Craig!&quot;  After a moment, you realize your outburst was probably less effective given your current state of dress or lack thereof.

&quot;I promise I will be good!  And I will get good marks!&quot;

&quot;Craig, I already said…&quot;

&quot;Puhleeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssseee, Tammy!&quot;

&quot;No--&quot;

&quot;PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEE!&quot; Craig screams with such volume you feel like your eardrums are about to pop.

&quot;Fuck!  Fine!  Shut up and stop your damn wailing.&quot;

You hesitate briefly but imagine yourself in a male locker room.  //It is not a big deal,// you whisper to yourself hopefully.

You shimmy out of your panties and show your vagina to Craig.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigshow.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Wow.  It is so pink!&quot; Craig comments as he moves in for a closer inspection.

You feel yourself warm up under Craig&#39;s laser like focus on your groin.  

//I can&#39;t believe Craig has got a better view of my pussy than I have...//  Sharing your most intimate of places with this intellectual child makes you feel guilty and gullible.  You wish that you could accelerate time to get this moment over with quicker.

&quot;Can you spread your legs more?&quot; Craig requests.  &quot;It is kind of hard to see…&quot;

&quot;Uh…&quot;  You open your legs wider, spreading your tight little pussy open for Craig to peer inside.

&quot;It would be um, more comfortable for us both on the bed, right?&quot; Craig suggests.

[[Lie on the bed and give Craig a closer view.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1243" name="Lie on the bed and give Craig a closer view." tags="" position="4931,13162" size="100,100">You fight off every warning instinct and slowly move to obey.  You know you should have stopped this escalation long ago yet you seem captivated by some sort of spell.  //Or maybe I am cursed?//  Every moment with Craig seems forbidden, awkward, and wrong.  //Maybe that is why I feel so … foggy?  I want to run away… and show off to this creep at the same time.  Man, I am really messed up in the head...//

You crawl naked onto Craig&#39;s bed and then turn to face him.  A shiver runs down your spine as you spread your legs for your young ward.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spreadforcraig.jpg&quot;&gt;

As you spread out your pussy, you are shocked at how wet you are.  //No, this is all messed up!  I can&#39;t be getting turned on… by … by … Craig…//

Craig follows you to the bed like a disfigured shadow.  [[He inspects your pussy with a look of wonder.]]

&quot;It is opening up for me!  It is … so… beautiful!  It is like a flower…. Ughh…&quot;  Craig&#39;s commentary makes you even more embarrassed.

//I am glad at least one of us is enjoying this...//

As your vision sweeps around the room, you do a double take as you look at the clock.  It is already shockingly late but you still have time before Sandra is supposed to return.

&quot;That&#39;s enough, Craig.  I showed you more than I should have already.&quot;

[[&quot;But I am not done yet!&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1245" name="&quot;But I am not done yet!&quot;" tags="" position="4939,13322" size="100,100">To your utter disbelief, Craig pushes his index finger straight into the middle of your vulnerable, aching pussy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigfinger.jpg&quot;&gt;
//Schliiiiiiiiiiiick!//

&quot;Uhnnnhnnnnnnnnn!&quot; you moan.  &quot;Crraaig…. Stop it!&quot;

Craig ignores you, pushing his large finger deeper inside you.

&quot;Agh.  Uhnnnnuhh...  Nooo!  Don&#39;t just put your finger in there!&quot;

&quot;But I wanted to touch it…&quot;

His obtuseness makes you angry.  &quot;You can&#39;t just touch someone like that without permission!&quot;

&quot;But you said I could!&quot;

&quot;No, I…&quot;  //I what?  I showed him my breasts and my vagina…  Fucking hell!  Not even Rhea would be this slutty...//  You can&#39;t help but blame yourself for your circumstances.  //Why did I have to lose…?//  &quot;Craig!&quot;

Craig resumes his experiments and restarts his finger fucking.  He continues to work his finger deeper into your warm crevice.  [[&quot;Amazing.  It is so warm and wet inside.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1246" name="&quot;Amazing.  It is so warm and wet inside.&quot;" tags="" position="4795,13408" size="100,100">You try and kick Craig away but your open legs make the effort impossible.

Craig continues to finger you.  He then withdraws a glistening finger and then immediately sniffs it.

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhh!&quot; he inhales, as if greeting the scent of a bouquet of flowers.  &quot;Wow… The scent of a woman!  This is Tammy&#39;s smell!&quot;  You are shocked into silence.  //What the heck is wrong with this guy!?  Or me for that matter?//

Craig begins to repeatedly sniff his finger.  His actions disturb and frighten you.

&quot;Craig, that&#39;s enough!&quot;

Before you can object any further, Craig&#39;s finger enters his mouth.  &quot;Mmmm…&quot;   He sucks on it as you cringe terror.  &quot;Mmm… Tammy… you taste way better than Sophie,&quot; Craig says to you with a perverted grin plastered across his lopsided face.

You are stunned into complete silence.  //Did he just say…?  Oh no…  This can&#39;t be fucking happening!//  You seem to have stumbled into a nightmare.

Craig then dives face first into your crotch.  You attempt to push him back but find your strength insufficient to budge Craig&#39;s large form.  You feel sick to your stomach as you realize how large the divide in mass and physical strength truly is.

Craig proceeds to ram his fingers inside you with ever increasing speed while lapping at your hot vagina with his tongue.

[[Craig seems determined to make you cum.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1247" name="Craig seems determined to make you cum." tags="" position="4935,13462" size="100,100">You begin to panic as you feel a familiar pressure begin to build within you.  //No!  I can&#39;t be getting turned on!// 

&quot;Uhh… it is too late…&quot;

The lewd sounds and sensations echoing from your now sopping pussy betray your internal protests.

&quot;Noo…&quot; you moan in agony.   &quot;I am… I am….&quot;  //I am what?  I can&#39;t let Craig make me cum!  I have to get out of here and erase the memories of this fucking night!//

Yet Craig&#39;s lapping tongue penetrates you and forces you grind your pussy into his face.  Craig stumbled upon your clitoris and you stiffen as a shock of warmth engulfs you from head to toe.  You feel a tingle spread across your exposed skin.  You acknowledge that Craig is providing you with an uncomfortably //wrong// feeling of pleasure.  

[[Give in.]]
[[Fight against your urges!]]

Instead of pushing Craig away, your fingers are now wrapped in his hair.  You gently buck against Craig&#39;s mouth as you lose yourself in the delightfully awful encounter.

You give in to the beckoning pleasure, uncaring for its source as long as the feeling is genuine.  You orgasm hard and fill Craig&#39;s mouth with love juice as you hump his face.  You lie back on the bed as Craig licks you clean.

You space out for a moment as you stare at the ceiling and catch your breath.  The next thing you know, Craig is naked and at your side.

The insanity of the moment shocks you back into reality.

You manage to block access to your pussy just as [[Craig presses his hard dick against your hands.]]

He then loses control with your glorious figure laid out before him.

Craig starts jerking off in front of your face.

&quot;W-what are you doing Crai---?&quot; you stammer but Craig cums before you can finish your sentence.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigjizz1.jpg&quot;&gt;
Semen flies through the air.  You get hit in the cheek and stomach.  Most dribbles harmlessly onto the bed.  After unloading all over you, Craig flops over, spent.

You are left with a foul fishy smell pervading the air, [[perfect for stewing in your shame and feelings of regret.]]

//And it makes my eyes water...//  You keep your opinions to yourself as Peeshi lights the incense.  &lt;img src=&quot;Images/incense.jpg&quot;&gt;
A strange heady yet sweet smell wafts throughout the room egged on by a swirling purple current of smoke.

“Now relax,” Peeshi whispers to you.

You shy away from Peeshi.  “It is hard to do with you so close to me.”

[[“Taylor, you must bear any distraction.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1252" name="“Taylor, you must bear any distraction.”" tags="" position="5843,18150" size="100,100">You close your eyes and feel surprisingly calm.  You practice breathing, inhaling more of the incense laden air with every cycle of your lungs.  Peeshi begins to speak in a surprisingly soft voice, gently explaining various meditation and concentration techniques.

You feel like you are making progress until Peeshi begins to test you again.

You freeze solid when Peeshi sets his huge hands on you.  He then sits behind you and you can sense his legs flanking your sides.  You can feel his muscular form like the back of a chair.  Without warning, his strong fingers begin to massage your shoulders.  “You’re so tense…” Peeshi rumbles.

“Um…”  //I am not really comfortable with this...// you think, quite unable to utter the words.

The Zen Master works on your shoulders until he begins to play with your bra strap.  Peeshi stops and you use the moment to reposition yourself away from him.  Peeshi looks troubled.  “There is something strange about you…”

[[“Strange?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1253" name="“Strange?”" tags="" position="5983,18204" size="100,100">“I have mentored hundreds of women… but you seem… //different//.  Your aura is an unusual color and your chakra...  It&#39;s masculine?  Hmm...”

“Um…”

Peeshi suddenly grabs your hand.  He then presses two fingers into the flesh above the underside of your wrist.  “Now, Taylor, please tell me the truth.  Why are you //really// here?”

You become alarmed.  //Is this guy a human lie detector too!?//

You look into Peeshi’s cold, unwavering eyes and feel a snake of fear uncoil in your belly.

[[Tell Peeshi some of the truth about your circumstances]]
[[Try and lie your way out]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1254" name="Tell Peeshi some of the truth about your circumstances" tags="" position="5845,18350" size="100,100">You don’t want to risk lying so you opt for a bit of vague truth.

“The truth is… my body has changed… and now so have I.  I need to be able to concentrate but that is impossible when I feel like a stranger in my own body,” you explain.  Speaking honestly about your condition removes a weight from your shoulders.

Peeshi listens eagerly as you explain about how awkward you feel.  After digesting your words, Peeshi leans forward with a small smile. He releases your wrist. “Ahhh…. It all makes sense now.  So you’re a late bloomer?  I understand completely.  The solution is simple: we must make you more comfortable with your budding, young, //sensual// body….  You must embrace your femininity!”

“Huh!?”  //Is this guy even listening to me!?//  “Hey!  I  don&#39;t think you get it.  I feel like I have been cursed!”

“This feeling is common among young women.  I am pleased to inform you that I have the cure.”

“You can cure me!?”

“Of course.  I am a master of Zen,” Peeshi brags.  “Come with me and I will show you the first step.”  You follow him into a second nearby room.  The new room is much smaller than the last.

[[Inside the cramped room is what appears to be a short massage table.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1255" name="Try and lie your way out" tags="" position="6138,18302" size="100,100">Maybe next time!

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mtable.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Relaxation and mental mastery are the solutions to your ills,” Peeshi sagely replies.

“How is getting a massage going improve my “mental mastery?””

“All things in this world are intertwined,” Peeshi answers.  “Let me conduct this ancient, sacred ceremony with you and you shall be cleansed and purified.  You will attain the confidence that you desire.  I give you my word as a Master of the Fifty Grand Ways.”

//How long have I been in this place?// you wonder.  Your thoughts flit around randomly.  You almost feel a little bit stoned…

“Taylor?  Are you alright?” 

“Uh huh…  Oh, yeah.  Sorry...”

[[“Will you perform the sacred ceremony with me?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1257" name="“Will you perform the sacred ceremony with me?”" tags="" position="5841,18501" size="100,100">“It depends on what it involves and how much it costs I guess.”

“For you my dear, it is free.”

You idly wonder why women seem to get so much free shit.  “And what would I have to do?”

“I am not permitted by the celestial heavens to tell you about the ritual until you agree to perform the entirety of the ritual - no matter what.”

“That sounds kind of sketchy…”

“Far from it!  I guarantee the results.  The methods, however, are a tad unorthodox…”

You appraise the Zen master, studying his dark, chiseled features.  He seems both extraordinarily trustworthy //and// super shady at the same time.

You cannot quite make your mind up about him.  //Either Peeshi is a genuine spiritual paragon… or a very deluded scammer...//

[[Agree to do the ritual with Peeshi]].
[[Decline and call it a night.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1258" name="Agree to do the ritual with Peeshi" tags="" position="5986,18599" size="100,100">“Yes, mis...//master// Pee.  I will do it.”

“Fantastic.  Now strip down to your underwear and lie down on the table.  It is very important that we both be in a relaxed state when we begin.”

“Eh?”  You look at Peeshi.  He seems dead serious.  He waits patiently for you to begin undressing.

//I am already one second into this and I want to back out...//

“Can you like, turn around or something?”

Master Peeshi smiles faintly but obliges your request.  [[You strip and lie face down on the massage table.]]

The master’s strong grip roams over your soft body, tracing your intimate feminine folds.  He spends a long time massaging your lower back.

//Fuck, I bet he is staring at my ass right now…  Don’t think about it….//

You try and use some of your meditation techniques.  You drift off and attempt to enjoy the practiced hands of Master Peeshi caressing your body.  The exercise is surprisingly easy … and effective.

Peeshi works every knot and fiber of worry from your stressed out body.  He seems to leech the soreness from your very bones.

“Mmm….”  //Damn this feels so good!  I should get massages more often.//

Although you feel a bit warm, [[you drift off to sleep.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1261" name="you drift off to sleep." tags="" position="5982,18747" size="100,100">You wake up all hot and sweaty.  Master Peeshi has massaged you into a sweaty lather.

His deft fingers massage their way down your thighs.

The proximity of his touch to your genitals makes your shiver.  //Ew… my panties are all sweaty...//

Your eyes snap open when Peeshi gently circles your vagina, lightly pushing the sodden fabric deeper into your crevice.

//Oh no… It isn’t sweat...//

You are unsure what to do.  You feel vulnerable but aroused at the same time.  You want to flee the building, kick Peeshi in the face, and continue the massage all at the same time.

“Ah, you’re awake.  Good timing,” Peeshi whispers to you as he rolls you onto your back.  He then adds some fresh oil to the front of your stomach, gradually working his fingers lower until he is stroking your pubic hair.

“Uh… This is….”

“It is alright, Taylor.  Just relax.  I will take care of you.”

//That’s what I am afraid of.//

Peeshi continues to play with you until your feeble protests turn to moans of pleasure.  Your soaked panties get tossed away while lewd sounds echo throughout the small massage room.

After a few minutes, Peeshi lays you down on the table and walks to a nearby cabinet.  He returns a second later.  “Drink this,” Master Peeshi commands, offering you a small bottle.  “It is the Elixir of Life,” he elaborates.  You shake your head.  “It is part of the ritual,” he adds in a more forceful tone.

[[Drink the elixir of life]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1262" name="Drink the elixir of life" tags="" position="5850,18849" size="100,100">You’re already so far down this path that you can’t bear quitting before completing your task.  You take the stopper off the bottle and smell its contents.  It has an unusual odor.  It smells like chestnuts with another scent that is hard to place.

At Peeshi’s urging, you upend the bottle and swallow the thick fluid with minimal effort.  You smack your lips together as you interpret the surprisingly bitter flavor.  “This tastes like…”

“The Elixir of Life is comprised of eighty percent semen,” Peeshi informs you.

“//S-semen!?//” 

Master Peeshi raises an eyebrow.  “The semen is all natural.  I made it myself.”

//I just drank this weirdo’s cum!?//  You begin to cough and gag, but as you do a strange, tingling euphoria spreads through your body.

“Whaaat’s haaapening to me?” you ask, as if your words are distorted or being uttered in slow motion.

Peeshi pushes you over like a domino onto your back.  [[He then guides his oily fingers straight into your vagina.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1263" name="He then guides his oily fingers straight into your vagina." tags="" position="5994,18903" size="100,100">He inserts two fingers inside you and begins to finger fuck you with a short, jerky rhythm that gradually increases in speed and intensity.

You feel a bit like you’re being raped.  Yet, somehow, losing control feels good.  //Peeshi’s hands...ughh…  They feel… so good…  I am going to...//

“Uhnnn!  I am going to cum!” you call out as you reach the brink.  Master Peeshi’s movements move into a crescendo, easily pushing you over the edge into milky, warm oblivion.

You orgasm with such violence you flop around the table like a freshly caught fish.

Fireworks are set off in your brain.  You have never felt better in your entire life.  “Oh my….”  //What the hell just happened?// you wonder as after spasms continue to force your body to twitch and tremble.

Peeshi watches you from above.  The next thing you know, [[the world goes dark.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1264" name="the world goes dark." tags="" position="5846,18989" size="100,100">When you open your eyes again you are back in the main temple.  You are naked and have been placed upon a central altar.  The cold metal covering of the altar presses against your warm skin.  You feel strange as the centerpiece of the room.  //I am like a venerated object...//

You find it difficult to move your neck.  You feel stiff despite just finishing a massage.

“H-hello?” you call out.  No one answers.  You wait in paralyzed silence for what seems like at least an hour.  Finally Peeshi appears.

“Taylor.  It is time for the final part of the ritual.  Remember that you must follow my instructions to the letter or else all our efforts will be for naught.  I have spent the past three hours praying and preparing for the ceremony.  This will be the toughest challenge yet, but if you follow my lead, //I will cure you.//”

You look around at the glittering room, at the implacable Peeshi, and then down at your naked form.  Your pussy is red and slightly puffy from the massage.  You feel like you deserve a prize for bad decisions.  Despite Peeshi’s actions, you still find it a bit hard to condemn the man.  //Although I am pretty sure he drugged me and committed sexual assault... //  Still, if Peeshi holds the answer to your problem, how could you turn down the opportunity when the finish line is in sight?

“Are you ready, Taylor?  We need to hurry; our time is limited.  The clarity you seek is attainable.”

[[Demand that he prove he is trustworthy]]
[[“Of course I am not that gullible, you fucking moron!”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1265" name="Demand that he prove he is trustworthy" tags="" position="5992,19105" size="100,100">Peeshi frowns.  “Well… Isn’t the time for that passed?  You have reviewed my testimonials and credentials on the website… My track record and results are impeccable.  And, to top it all off, you have already tasted my seed.  You might as well finish the rest of the ritual.  Do you really want to throw away this chance?”

The reminder makes you a bit angry, but it disgusts you too.  You fall silent as Peeshi lights another stick of incense.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/incense.jpg&quot;&gt;
The strange smoke again wafts through the air, further jumbling your already swirling mind.  “Er… Well, what does this ritual involve?  After the last one I can’t say I am enthusiastic about doing any more...”

&quot;I will show you.&quot;

With butterflies dancing in your stomach, you follow Peeshi to the back of the building where the decor drastically shifts to more of an industrial warehouse. 

Peeshi beckons to a small table and [[chair set up next to a mirror.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1266" name="“Of course I am not that gullible, you fucking moron!”" tags="" position="5697,19047" size="100,100">“Moron!?”

EoC :\ 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1267" name="Suck Peeshi’s dick" tags="" position="5992,19293" size="100,100">With every second that ticks by, your will to protest shrinks as you inhale more of the strange incense.  Instead of calming you, each breath makes your heart beat faster.

//Why does he have an erection!?  And why do I feel so … weird?  I just want to learn a few things and get the fuck out of here...//

The fastest way out of your predicament seems to involve pleasuring Peeshi or running out the door.  You would leave immediately but you feel like you have indeed made some progress with your meditative sessions.  Peeshi seems to command a odd, magnetic aura that seems to be beckoning you forth.

[[You let Peeshi gently push you to your knees.]]

Your dignity is worth far more to you than a chance to learn how to control your powers.







Objections?  Maybe next time.  Current end.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1269" name="chair set up next to a mirror." tags="" position="5847,19187" size="100,100">Zen Master Peeshi paints your face with strange designs while chanting a spell.  Afterwards, you step inside a ring of salt.

You feel a bit foolish but follow along.

“Alright, let us begin.”

“Begin what?  Are you going to say some words?”

“No, the prayers are done.  Now we must please the gods with action.”

“What do I have to do?”

“You must ingest the essence of a man,” the Master answers without missing a beat.

“God damnit.  Of course it has to be something disgusting like that.  I don’t want to drink another elixir now that I know what’s in it.”

“The elixir is not good enough.  The essence must be //fresh.//”

You can’t believe your ears.  “You don’t mean…”

Peeshi begins to fumble with his luminescent purple shorts.  He pulls them down and a giant penis the color of dark teak flops out.

You choke on your surprise, for Master Peeshi appears to be fully erect.

“Let’s complete the ritual, Taylor.  Confidence, control, and //bliss// awaits us.”

//Ahhhhhhhhhh!//  You feel hot and painfully conflicted.  //Am I really falling for this circus?//
[[Suck Peeshi’s dick]]
[[“I can’t do that!”]]

Peeshi’s massive cock is now in front of your face.

“Oh my…”

Unwilling to prolong the moment, you reach out and touch Peeshi’s hot flesh.  You run your hands up and down his length until Peeshi is fully engorged in your hand.  //I just met this guy and now I am holding his penis...//

You stare at Peeshi’s cockhead, unwilling to do more.  // I know he is lying… or I think he is… but….//  You decide if there is even a 1% chance he is telling the truth his knowledge is worth pursuing.

//Fuck my life...//  Your lips kiss the springy flesh of Peeshi’s glans.  One kiss leads to another and soon you are sucking the Master’s dick, his large penis moving ever deeper into your throat with each successive thrust.

The sudden, unfamiliar action and gross taste dulls your efforts.  “This is disgusting…”

“Imagine that it isn’t,” Peeshi advises, as if the idea was obvious.  “You’re doing great, Taylor...mmm… excellent work…”  Peeshi’s compliment makes you burn with embarrassment but you continue your efforts.  “Keep it up… I-we are almost finished!”

Soon your partner is groaning in delight as your mouth is filled with an unpleasantly bitter taste.

//Gaahhgg!//  You gag as Peeshi’s penis hits the back of your throat.

You settle into a steady rhythm.  The Zen Master slides in and out of your mouth until you feel a switch flip in your head.

//I am sucking a dick…  Again… ahhhhhhh!//  You slap down your mind’s attempt to compare Peeshi to Drew.

Your mouth suddenly floods with precum as Peeshi grabs your head and takes command.  Moments later, Peeshi begins to ejaculate.

[[Swallow and complete the ritual]]
[[Eww!  Spit this gross shit out!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1271" name="Swallow and complete the ritual" tags="" position="5705,19433" size="100,100">You brace yourself and open your mouth as Peeshi gives you a big mouthful of pungent cum.  You try not to gag and fail.  You cover your mouth.  You barely resist the urge to vomit but somehow manage to keep Peeshi’s load contained behind your sealed lips.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fullmouth.jpg&quot;&gt;
You lock eyes.  Peeshi silently implores you to “complete the ritual.”

You fight back tears and a wave of nausea and then do your best to choke down Peeshi’s seed with one big gulp.

“Ahh….  I just swallowed....” A disgusting aftertaste rules your mouth as you look up at an adoring Master Peeshi.


Current end for now :*(

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/peeshiyuck.gif&quot;&gt;
Cum splatters all over you and much flies over your shoulder.  You cough and in the process accidently swallow a tiny bit of Peeshi’s seed.

“You wasted it…” Peeshi says in disbelief.  “Now we will have to start all over again.”

You roll your eyes.  “Mhmm!  Evan… why don’t you try your fucking sales routine on someone who is an actual girl?” you ask your friend.

“Because I like you the most,” Evan answers without missing a beat.  “We’re perfect together, Taylor.  I learned long ago that life does not get any better than perfect - only worse.  I think we should take every opportunity we have and engage in as much //fun// as possible.”

You give an exaggerated groan.  “I bet I can guess what kind of fun you are talking about.”

Evan seems confused.  “There is only one kind of fun!”

You remain silent until Evan reaches over and rubs your thigh.  He gives you a suggestive smile.

“Let’s make a pitstop!” 

[[“A lewd pitstop?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1274" name="“A lewd pitstop?”" tags="" position="2597,18089" size="100,100">“The best kind!”

“Evan, I don’t know.  I think maybe we should, uh, take it easy?  We have gone kind of overboard lately.”

“What’s gotten into you?  C’mon, no one will see us.  Aren’t you interested in a little quicky?  Just imagine how good it will feel...”

“Didn’t I //just// suck you off?”  &lt;&lt;if $swallow1 is true&gt;&gt; //Yes I did.  I can still taste it… Fuck!//  &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“Yes and that was awesome.  But now I have been driving next to you for like a fucking hour!  I can’t take it anymore!”

Without further discussion, Evan turns the car off the highway onto a sketchy looking dirt road.

You ride along with nothing except the sound of shifting gravel and a tense atmosphere to keep you company.

Evan finds an oval shaped parking spot backed with trees where he can turn around.  “This is area looks good,” Evan opines as he stops and exits the car.

You remain seated, seatbelt on.   You castigate yourself for being so weak willed.  You fear that if you step outside you will again succumb to the temptations of your feminine body.

“Hey Taylor,” Evan pesters you from outside.  “It is beautiful out here.  Don’t you want to stretch your limbs?” Evan innocently inquires.

[[Get out of the car.]]
[[Remain seated.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1276" name="Get out of the car." tags="" position="2544,18288" size="100,100">You get out of the car for some fresh air.

“I am just stretching my legs,” you inform Evan when he wiggles his eyebrows at you.

Evan grins.  “What better way to stretch them out than to wrap them around me?”  

You scowl at Evan.  Yet his words stir an ember of lust into a flame within your lower abdomen.

//Maybe I am a bit heated up from earlier...//

“But someone might see us!” you breathlessly object.  //We didn’t drive far off the highway!//

“That’s part of the allure.”  Evan is suddenly so close to you that you look up at him with surprise.  “I am so glad you came out here with me Taylor.  This has all been awesome.  You’re the greatest, hottest babe ever…. Uhhnn…”  

“Evan!  Get ahold of yourself!”

“Mmmm…. I would rather hold you instead….Mmm.  You’re so soft… Ahh…  You smell so good...” Evan mumbles as he begins to paw at you.  He fondles your breasts and gently rubs the outlines of your areolas.  You let him take off your shirt.  [[Soon your breasts are bare, kissed by the cool autumn air and Evan’s eager lips.]]

You //definitely// need this just as much as I do…” Evan rationalizes.  He then slides his fingers down the front of your panties.  He rubs your swollen, wet, sensitive flesh.  “See?  I am not the only one getting ready.”

“Getting ready?  Oh.”  Your eyes fall on Evan’s dick.  “Um… Evan, don’t you think this is going a bit far?” you wonder as Evan massages your increasingly wet vaginal folds.  “Maybe we should take things easy…. Uhhh… stop that…”

Even intensifies his efforts and then stops.  You can now feel warm love juice running down your leg.

//Ugh… I guess I ended up getting turned on after all…  Still, giving in to Evan… and my own constant cravings can’t be good for our mental health!  (Or our relationship…)//

Evan gently reorients you so are facing the hood of the car.  He then slides your pants off and then takes more time with your underpants, which are now sweaty and wet, clinging desperately to your butt cheeks.

Evan peels those off too and takes a deep sniff before throwing them casually on the hood of the car.

“Evan…”

“Taylor, let’s fuck.”

[[“Okay.”]]
[[“I would kind of rather not…”|Remain seated.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1279" name="“Okay.”" tags="" position="2596,18488" size="100,100">You cannot deny that you feel horny as well.  //Ughh… Here we go again…  Maybe Evan and I have similar sex drives?  At least I am not as perverted as he is!//

“Oh!” you yelp as Evan massages the front of your vagina.

He soon has you naked and bent over the hood of the car.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pitstop.jpg&quot;&gt;
You expect Evan to fuck you but he exhibits surprising self control.  His bold fingers penetrate you further, sliding in and out of your sodden sex.  Evan then finger fucks you until the squelching sounds overpower those of the nature around you.

“Uhh… Oh… man….” you moan.  Evan heads right for your weak points and you soon feel yourself edging towards orgasm as Evan steadies your wobbling knees with his pistoning fingers.  “Hn…  Why does this have to feel so good?” you wonder.

Evan answers your somewhat rhetorical question.  “Something about the propagation of the human species?”

Evan then withdraws his fingers and leaves you feeling an unbearable emptiness, a yearning from deep within your core.

“Evan…”

“Don’t worry, Taylor.  I won’t stop until we both cum.  Get ready.  [[Here comes the dick!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1280" name="Here comes the dick!”" tags="" position="2444,18590" size="100,100">“Uhhnnnnnnghh….” Evan’s huge cock penetrates you until you are completely filled with Evan’s hard flesh.  Evan grabs your butt and repoisitons you for better access.  He then begins to bang you from behind with long, powerful strokes.

You proceed to fuck like animals, braced on the hood of Evan’s car.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/pitstop3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You throw your backside backwards to meet Evan’s insatiable penis.

“Oh man, Taylor… you are really getting into this.  You love my cock, don’t you?”

With Evan’s thundering manhood surging inside you, you cum hard, pushing yourself into a feeling of contentment.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pitstop2.jpg&quot;&gt;
You flip over and begin to have sex face to face.

Evan orgasms inside you, leaning forward to plant a firm kiss on your lips as his cock stirs your cream covered insides.

Something snaps in your mind.  You return Evan’s kiss and begin to make out on the car’s hood like two young lovers.

The rest of the ride home is nearly silent as [[you wage a fierce internal debate.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1281" name="you wage a fierce internal debate." tags="" position="2600,18640" size="100,100">//Why did this happen?  How do I escape this erotic loop?  Could I take control of myself if I tried?  Or am I getting addicted these feelings?//

You are continually conscious of your full pussy.

Evan seems to sense your unease.  “What’s wrong?” he asks you.

“Evan, I think we got really carried away.  How many times did we do it?”

“I don’t know… a lot.”

“Did you have to finish inside me like every damn time?”

“I am sorry!  I couldn&#39;t help it!  Your pussy just milks me dry…”

//Ew… Evan’s drained but I am a sopping mess.  Not only does this feel super gross it is also a reminder of what we have been doing.  Sex…  and obviously not for the purpose of reproduction!//

“Um…”  //Reproduction!?  Fuck...//  You attempt to imagine having a child with Evan but find the exercise to be impossible.  //I definitely need to talk to him about this...//

You sigh.  //No time like the present...//  You decide to be diplomatic.  “Evan, we need to be more careful.”

“Careful?  What do you mean?”

“This body has a lot of urges… I don’t know what it is capable of.  I am too young to be a father...or mother or whatever the fuck I am…”

“Oh!”  Evan goes silent as he mulls over your words.  “Yeah, maybe we have gotten a bit carried away…” he agrees.

You nod.  “That is an understatement…”

“Don’t get me wrong though!  I don’t regret this weekend.  It was … awesome.  It was the best trip of my life if I am being honest.”

[[Agree with Evan.]]
[[Remain silent.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1282" name="plants a kiss upon your lips." tags="" position="14581,9680" size="100,100">“Mhphagagfah!” you cough and spit when you push him away.  “What the fuck, Damien!?”

//I just kissed Damien… AGAIN!  EWWWWWWW!  I need an acid bath ASAP...//  For some reason kissing seemed even worse than anything you&#39;ve done up until that point.

Damien does not answer nor does he give you any time to think.  You watch in horror as Damien slides a thick finger into your tiny vagina and proceeds to firmly finger fuck you.

“Ahhh!  Damien, that hurts!  You’re spreading me apart!”you cry out.  Damien moves in to kiss you again and you slap him as hard as you can across the face.  Although your attack makes a loud noise and leaves a red mark on Damien’s cheek, he seems unfazed. 

Damien laughs.  “This is just the warm up.”

//A warm up!?  He can’t mean...//  “Damien, we are not having sex!”  You are adamant in your declaration.

“Okay, no problem.  But I want you to do something else for me.  Nothing bad.  Just some words.”

Damien’s complete and sudden reversal puts you on your guard.

[[“I want you to call me daddy,” Damien nonchalantly requests.]]

Damien seems irritated.  “Is the idea that repulsive?  Compared to what we have already done…  It is just a few innocent words….”  Damien trails off when you glare at him.  //Innocent words my ass!//

Damien remains silent for a minute or so before his demeanor suddenly changes again.  Damien smirks at you as he stands up.  He towers over you and you suddenly feel small, powerless, and fragile.  “Young lady,” Damien begins.  “You, my dear, have a potty mouth.  You should put it to good use or else daddy will have to discipline his little girl.”

Damien’s creepy acting turns your stomach.  //I hope he’s acting...//  “I am not your fucking little girl!  Damien, this isn’t funny!”

A chill runs down your spine as you meet Damien’s gaze.  He meets your eyes impassively.  You know in an instant that you are in trouble.  //He really is serious...//

“Damien-”

“//Daddy,//” he firmly corrects you.  “Say “I am daddy’s little girl,” for me please.”

Damien says “please” but it is obvious this is more of an order than a request.

[[“Fine, DADDY, you owe me big if I do this for you.”]]

“Uhhhhhhhhh!”  Damien nods eagerly.  “Say it again!”

You roll your eyes and repeat the line.  Damien moans with pleasure at your little act.  “Ahhh… that sounded //awesome//.  Say it again please.  Call me daddy!” he badgers you.

“Pfft… I would really rather not.  This is too fucking weird for me, offense meant.”

“Offense… meant?”

“Yeah, the opposite of no offense!  I mean to offend you because you are an asshole and you should feel bad.”

Damien bows down before you.  “Please Taylor, just humor me!  I need this to complete my bucket list!  PLEASE!”

“Okay… daddy…”

“Ohhh!”

[[“You’re pathetic.”]]

&quot;Out!&quot; you curtly reply. You swipe twenty bucks sticking out from a random pair of Damien&#39;s pants and head out into the sunshine.

Your sudden freedom excites you. A dozen fun possibilities spring to mind. You want to get ice cream and run until your cabin fever disappears. You briefly imagine dropping by your house or maybe checking up on your friends. //Ohhh what should I do?//

As you walk through the park, you notice several men staring at you. At first you assume it is your imagination but soon it happens so overtly it is impossible to deny.

You begin to move faster until you break into a jog.

//Huhh… Huhh… Hahh...// You hear heavy breathing and footfalls behind you. For an instant you fear the worst. //Is it those men from the hospital!?// You accelerate until you break into a full on run, moving as fast as your tiny legs will carry you. Despite your best efforts, the noise remains, drawing closer by the second.

A jogger practically chases you off the path. You step aside and the man whizzes by you without a care. //What is up with everyone!?//

You stop to catch your breath at a bench. The bench is occupied by a man but you sit down anyway. The old man smiles at you but instead of reassuring you, it comes off as something else entirely. 

[[&quot;Hello there, beauty!&quot;]] coos the old man.

“No way!  I am not saying that!”

“Why not?” 

“Because that is embarrassing and //weird//!  Why can’t you just leave me the hell alone?”

“I already explained that.  You’re just too cute!”

“Fuck off.”

“Yeah…”  Damien begins to stroke his dick.  “You want to get your fuck off with daddy, right?”

“That isn’t what I said!”

“Yeah… you love it!” Damien continues to pleasure himself, interpreting your words as he pleases.  “I will let you stay here for a month rent free if you say what I want.”

A few words to remove a large debt?  The idea is attractive.  //Words are cheaper than actions...  Ah, whatever!  They are only words.//  [[“Daddy, I want to suck your dick.”]]

Damien has his underwear off in a second.  The next thing you know, Damien has pulled you close and pressed his hard penis against your closed lips.

“What the fuck!?” you protest but when your mouth opens Damien pushes in his glans.  You spit it out angrily.

“You requested this!  Please, baby, take care of daddy!” Damien urges you while stroking his leaking cock in front of your face.

//Why does this keep happening to me?  I guess it serves me right for indulging this pervert...//

You slowly start to jerk Damien’s dick.  Your friend’s manhood appears comically large next to your small extremities.

Damien’s dick becomes so large and hard you can’t help but marvel at the thing.  

&quot;Mm... it is so big...&quot;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1288" name="You feel like you have made a big mistake." tags="" position="14631,10278" size="100,100">Your fears are immediately confirmed. From that day on, Damien’s creepiness intensifies. 

“Hey, Taylor! Guess what I got....” Damien interrupts you while packing an escape bag.

You look at Damien’s armful of colorful bottles with disdain. “I am not your lab rat! No more fucking potions!” you shout at him, your unnaturally high voice coming off like a child’s scream.

Damien frowns. “How did you guess? Did that last potion make you psychic?”

“No, it’s because you’re so damned transparent that you’re practically see-through!” you yell at him.

“Well, this is going to work for sure!” Damien cheerfully proclaims as he sets a small bottle on the table.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/powerpot.jpg&quot;&gt;
You look at the foul looking greenish-black fluid and feel ill.
“I am not drinking that shit,” you flatly refuse.

The sensation reminds you of  a suddenly recalled memory only in infinitely greater quantity and detail.  
After a few minutes you begin to feel sleepy.  After a few more, you fall asleep on the bench.

When next you wake, you feel refreshed but a bit uncomfortable.  You now have a dull pain behind your right ear along with a slightly different world view.

You can immediately sense that something is off.  //I feel different somehow...//.  &quot;How long was I out for?&quot; you mumble.

&quot;Just a few minutes!&quot; the Envoy answers from your side.

&quot;Wait…  I remember!  It is all here!&quot;  You make a fist and a torrent of self defense and dance images flash through your mind.  &quot;This is amazing…&quot;

You feel like you have an endless reservoir of information and energy to draw upon.

&quot;And hopefully they may save your life.  Follow me please.&quot;

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;To meet our client.&quot;

&quot;Right now!?&quot;

You and the Envoy board a private plane.  All security waves you through the airport.

A short flight later and cab ride later, you arrive at a nondescript apartment building.  You follow the Envoy into an underground parking lot.

A strange compulsion comes over you.  You are suddenly very curious about Miss QS and the circumstances leading up to your summons.

&quot;Please tell me about the case,&quot; you request.

Taylor stares off into the distance.  She now looks very sad, a step away from tears.  &quot;Well, my friend Cody died… &quot; she begins.  &quot;The police said it was a suicide but I… I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;

&quot;And you think he was murdered?&quot;

The young singer looks around like a scared kitten before sadly nodding.

&quot;He noticed some… irregularities in the accounting of some of my business dealings…&quot;

&quot;Why was he even looking at such information?  Who was Cody to you?&quot;

&quot;Cody was just a friend… a good friend.  I mentioned in passing one day that the //annual bank fees// were killing me.  He thought it should be a token amount and wouldn&#39;t believe me.  So I showed him.&quot;

&quot;And then he died right after?&quot;

[[&quot;A few days later.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1293" name="&quot;A few days later.&quot;" tags="" position="6786,21146" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm.  What do you think he did in the interim before his death?  Did he meet someone at the bank?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think he got that far.  He said he was going to talk to Amelia Quin, my manager, first.  I think he thought her management fees were too high as well.&quot;

&quot;Why do you think Cody was so concerned over your financial health?&quot;

&quot;Cody?  Cody never really cared about money.  He was the most level headed guy I have ever known.  He just didn&#39;t want to see me getting ripped off… He was just being protective I think.&quot;

//Hmm, or he was in love with you...//

You arrive at Taylor&#39;s mansion just as the sun sets.  You follow your client into a lavish living space and continue your conversation.

Taylor QS hands you a folder.  &quot;The police report involving Cody&#39;s death,&quot; she elaborates.  &quot;And there is a page about Leo too.&quot;

[[&quot;Leo?  Who is Leo?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1294" name="&quot;Leo?  Who is Leo?&quot;" tags="" position="6630,21200" size="100,100">&quot;My former manager.  He… uh, tragically killed himself…&quot;

The information makes your eyebrows shoot up.  &quot;Your former manager killed himself too?&quot;  //How many tragic suicides have occured around this woman!?//

&quot;Before Amelia took over?  Yes.  But Leo was a very unhappy man.  I think he was just tired and fed up with life.  Cody, on the other hand…  That guy would never kill himself.  I am certain of it.&quot;

You ask a hard question next. &quot;Hmm…  How did Cody die?&quot;

&quot;They say he... He… shot himself…  I could never bring myself to look at the report… it was all too upsetting.&quot;

You note several inconsistencies right off the bat.

&quot;Hmm… Some of these dates are weird.  Hmm... drugs in his system but no history of past use… and the autopsy… is missing.&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t do one,&quot; says Taylor.  &quot;There is just the medical examiner report.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t they do one?&quot;

&quot;His family didn&#39;t want the stuff about the drugs to become public.&quot;

//That doesn&#39;t seem to add up...//  &quot;Was Cody a drug user?&quot;

&quot;No, not to my knowledge.  I doubt he could be a secret drug addict for long…  I am a pretty inquisitive friend.&quot;

&quot;I see Cody&#39;s watch is on his right hand,&quot; you note.  [[&quot;Was he a lefty by any chance?&quot;]]

You lock yourself inside the bathroom.

You pick up a magazine with none other than your client gracing the cover.  You use the magazine cover to focus, feeling the uncomfortable sensations of your transformation flow through your body.

You will your eyes to become bright blue.  After a moment of inaction, they flash and change color, appearing to have a discharge of sapphire ink within your iris.

//Miss Quicksilver is way taller…  C&#39;mon Taylor!  Be TALL!//

You are  gripped by excruciating pain as your legs and spine begin to slowly stretch out.

&quot;Aghhh!  Fuck…  This really hurts...&quot;

//Blonder… rounder…. Aghh…  longer lashes.//

Lastly, you redden your lips before completing the ensemble.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ttmakeup.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
It takes you quite a while to match the picture but eventually you mirror the beautiful heart shaped face of your host perfectly.

&quot;I am fine,&quot; you say as you step outside into the light.

Taylor&#39;s mouth drops open when she sees you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ttransform.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;W-what!?  How did you… Where…?&quot;  She finally settles on: &quot;Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;It is me, Taylor.&quot;

&quot;Taylor and… Taylor?  OH-MY-GOD!&quot; Ms. Quicksilver&#39;s eyes light up.  &quot;This is awesome!  It is like a fantasy!  You&#39;re //perfect!//&quot;

&quot;Wait!  What am I supposed to do?&quot; you call after him.

&quot;Whatever the client wants.  Solve the case.  Impress us with your initiative,&quot; he shouts back over his shoulder

You are left alone with Taylor QS and her older companion.

&quot;Uh, hi.&quot;

&quot;Man, that guy is so weird!&quot; Tay QS remarks with a giggle.  &quot;So you&#39;re our miracle worker?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

&quot;This is my dad, Raymond.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you…&quot;  You find it difficult to speak in this woman&#39;s presence.  //Even in a dingy parking garage, she sparkles like a marvelous jewel...//

&quot;That guy vouched for you so that is enough for me.  Let&#39;s go to my place.  We have a lot to talk about.&quot;

You grimace as your mind puts together a potential crime scene.

You flip through the report and reread a section.  &quot;Gunfire residue on the right hand…  Damn…&quot;  //It is a minor detail but still… it really bothers me.  Why would a lefty kill themselves with their right hand?  That would be very awkward...//  You mentally appraise the rough angle of entry and do a few calculations that lead you to a dark conclusion.  &quot;I was hoping it wouldn&#39;t be obvious foul play but this is bad…&quot;  //Who would have the resources to do this?//  You suppose any rich person with the right contacts could probably pull off some sort of scheme as long as they had the inclination and enough time.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Taylor asks you.  You smile at her concern.

&quot;I am fine.  I just have a few threads to investigate.  I will keep you posted.&quot;  //No sense scaring her before I get more information...//

&quot;So when is the other agent arriving?&quot; Taylor suddenly asks you.

&quot;What other agent?&quot;

&quot;I requested a lookalike.  I have a few things I want to look into and I want to speak to some outside counsel… but Amelia has been hounding me lately.  My schedule is merciless.  I have a plan to flush out some of these crooks as well but I need time to set up.&quot;

&quot;I think I am supposed to be your lookalike.&quot;  Taylor QS blinks and then frowns.

&quot;I don&#39;t think there is much resemblance…  If I don&#39;t get a passable one then I will never be able to get out from under Amelia&#39;s thumb.  I am afraid I am kind of disappointed.  I can hire other investigators.&quot;

&quot;I need to use the washroom.  I will be right back,&quot; you interrupt.  [[Tay QS points down the hall.]]

&quot;Usually in these cases it is just an overzealous fan with an unrealistic attachment.&quot;

&quot;Stalkers?  No problem.  I will just kick them in the balls.  Anyone this famous is bound to attract a few weirdos.  It is just statistics!&quot;  You tap your lip thoughtfully.  &quot;Hmm… but //death threats// that sounds ominous and a lot more serious.&quot;  //I will have to be careful… I am not really sure what I am up against here.  Better safe than sorry!//

&quot;Your level headedness is impressive,&quot; the Envoy compliments you.  &quot;Most probationary agents end up pursuing a reckless strategy and make silly mistakes.  This line of work isn&#39;t really like the movies, but there is glamor as well as high stakes.  Everything you do is a matter of life and death.&quot;

Once transformed, you and your new friend walk into the apartment lobby.

&quot;Hello Ms. Prynn!  Your special security that you requested has arrived.&quot;

A moment later a buzzer sounds and unlocks the thick glass doors.  After a lengthy elevator ride, you arrive outside a spacious apartment with [[the scent of lavender hanging outside the doorway.]]

&quot;Taylor.

&quot;I wanted to meet some of the people around and see what I am working with.  Security seems tight here, I doubt anyone would try to break in with all of us right here.&quot;

Matthew looks around to confirm you are alone before whispering in your ear, &quot;What if they don&#39;t have to break in?  What if they are already inside?&quot;

&quot;...Who?&quot;

&quot;Whoever is fucking with us!  We have been locked down like this for a month and weird shit //still keeps happening.//&quot;

&quot;Hmm…  I thought this would be a guard job but perhaps we need to do some //internal investigations?&quot;//

&quot;Of course!  She looks like me!&quot; Natalie responds.

You nod shyly, suddenly feeling overly self conscious under the photographer&#39;s steady gaze.  Your host directs you to the rear of the loft.

You head into the changing room.

You hold up a garment of red silk that is so thin you can see your hand through it.  //I can&#39;t wear this!//

You try them on and are unsurprised to find that Natalie looks awesome in anything.

&quot;Yep!  Just a second.&quot;

You look to a nearby mirror and zone out.  As you glance at your statuesque reflection, you can&#39;t help but feel a bit aroused.  //Am I turning into a narcissistic lady?// you idly wonder.  

You eventually snap out of your strange trance.  You are left with clothes scattered everywhere.

Julie rolls her eyes at the sudden compliment. “Oh, I see where this is going… what do you need, Taylor?”

You grab your clothes and step out into the bathroom.

A few seconds later, Sandra opens the front door.

&quot;Hey guys!  How was your night?&quot; Sandra asks you once she kicks off her shoes.

You open your mouth but find that after your ordeal you lack the will and the words to speak.  Luckily, Craig fills the void of your silence.  &quot;It was great!  Tammy is a good at games!  She is so nice!&quot; 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good!&quot;

&quot;Please hire Tammy.  I like her.&quot;

&quot;Shh… Maybe I will.  Tammy looks tired… and so do you.&quot;  Sandra gently pushes Craig and he heads upstairs.

You just want to go home and shower.  You move to the doorway and begin putting on your shoes.  Sandra follows close behind you.

&quot;I really appreciate this, Tammy.  Text me your number when you get a new phone.&quot;  Sandra then presses a thick wad of cash into your hand.  You don&#39;t count it, but figure there is probably at least $200 in the wad.  //Holy shit… Babysitting is lucrative!  I just wish I didn&#39;t feel like such a slut...//

&quot;Did you need a ride home?&quot; Sandra offers.

&quot;Uh…&quot;

You soon spot the source.  //Julie must have left the TV on...//

“In other news, a shockingly grizzly murder of a security guard has horrified the city.  Dale Gilmesh Jr. was on duty on Mill Street at the recently abandoned Green Cross medical facility,” relays the news anchor.  //Wait what…!?//  An awful sinking feeling envelopes you.  You feel like you are locked within quicksand.  You stop in your tracks and slowly turn towards the TV.  “The murder’s brutality has shocked the community.  Patricia Street is on scene with the chief of police.”  Your mental block and horrible suppressed memories come flooding back at one.  //I witnessed a fucking murder!//

You hold your breath as the screen cuts to a shot outside the hospital you and Drew had just visited.

A police chief has a microphone thrust in front of his face. “This is the most gruesome murder in our city’s history and we will exhaust every resource and avenue of inquiry to bring this matter to a swift, just resolution!” he declares.

//No way…  The cops aren’t equipped to handle this!  They need to call Ghostbusters or some shit!//

“Police have released a photo of a young woman believed to have witnessed the murder,” the anchor continues.  “Law enforcement is urging this woman to step forward and contact the police at ….”

You nearly keel over and have a flow blown heart attack when you [[see your own photo plastered across the screen.]]

You inadvertently scream.  You wanted to yell, but your new, higher and more emotion laden voice echoes throughout the house.  “Ohhhhhhhh……...FUUUUUUUCK!”  You can scarcely believe your own eyes.  “How in the hell did they get such a good picture of me!?”

//This is bad.  Really bad.  I am like the most suspicious person ever!  There is no way they will believe me.  I don’t even have ID!  And now I have to explain to the cops that the real murderer is a black ghost?//

Your eyes go wide with realization.  “FuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!  Now they will think I am //RACIST// too!  NooooooOOOOoooo!” you wail in a state of mental agony.  “God damnit!  I sound so crazy…  “I am sorry officer, I turned into a chick and witnessed a ghostly murder…”  I really don’t want to get locked in a fucking looney bin…”  You have never trusted psychiatrists… or the police.

You collapse onto the couch and hold your throbbing head in your hands.  //What am I going to do now?//  

[[“I am sooo fucked!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1324" name="“I am sooo fucked!”" tags="" position="10395,33634" size="100,100">You are unsure if police scrutiny would be a completely negative event.  Surely you have some sort of civic duty to warn the authorities about a murderous ghost?  Maybe an investigation would even help you uncover the truth of your transformation.   //Most likely not...//  The only silver lining that you can see is that Drew appears to be uninvolved.

“Talking to cops never does any good… but still, I don’t want to be the subject of a fucking manhunt… er womanhunt?   Maybe they will believe it is all a misunderstanding?  Ah fuck, who the hell am I kidding?  If I tell them the truth it will attract more suits with bad intentions.”

You look down at your cell phone.  Your conscience urges you to call while your common sense begs you to put the phone down and forget you ever went to the hospital with Drew.  //It was actually kind of fun though… I just wish I could forget the last part...//

That’s when it really occurs to you.  //What if the ghost goes after me or Drew!?//

“I need help!”  //But I should think very carefully about what I am going to say...//  You want to be completely honest but you are aware it is foolish to be overly forthcoming around the police.

“That’s right… I don’t want to get fingered for fucking murder!”  //I need a less insane sounding story.  Lying is definitely the better option here!//

You consider using Drew as an alibi but dismiss the idea.  //I don’t want him to get roped into all this…  He has taken enough punches for me.//

“Damn!”  Such a high profile case is bound to attract excessive attention and danger.  &quot;I should...&quot;

You recall hearing that the most convincing lies are based on the truth.

“The only thing I don’t have an answer for is the most basic of questions…  Who in the fuck am I supposed to be?”

You have the urge to pee, so you retreat to the bathroom and do your business.  As you are washing your hands, your eyes take in the reflected image.  

After a bit of narcissistic admiration, you head into your room and begin changing into comfortable clothes.  //If I am going to be fucking interrogated I might as well be comfy!// you think as you undress.  Suddenly your eyes catch your own in the small mirror above your dresser.  Like a moth drawn to a flame, you are pulled inexorably towards the mirror.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taymirror.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You stare at the sexy woman, imagining that she is anybody but you.

After a moment of quiet contemplation, you suddenly have a brilliant idea.

Drew climbs off you and gives you a breather, although all you can taste and smell is cum.  //I bet I look hot right now... damn, I wish I could see myself from Drew&#39;s point of view.//  “I definitely need to take some pics for “nostalgia” purposes,” you casually say to Drew.  &quot;Want to help me make a little memento?&quot; you offer/

It is true that Drew can keep a secret.  //There is just the two of us here...//  You don’t want to do anything degrading but it seems like an easy trade if it could benefit Drew and improve his confidence.  It would also do wonders for your implied debt.  //Pictures are worth more than words, right?//  

//Bloom might save me but that is only because of Drew...  I am only here because of him.//  You look up at Drew’s round, adoring face and feel your own flush with embarrassment.  You bite a cum stained lip.  //I bet Drew would appreciate a souvenir… and maybe I can convince him to share!//

You thrust out your chin and pout your lips as Drew’s semen dribbles down your face.  “Take a picture,” you request.

“I can’t do that!”

“Don’t you want to remember this?”

“I don’t need a picture for that.  Believe me, I will never forget this... what you have done for me, I mean...”

Drew stares at you for about thirty seconds, clearly etching your cream accentuated features into his memory.

After another quiet minute, Drew seems to reconsider.  He takes out his cellphone.  “Is this really okay?”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aaa-img-963.gif&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;


“Yeah, it’s okay.  I trust you.  [[Just don’t tell Evan.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1331" name="Just don’t tell Evan.”" tags="" position="10232,33090" size="100,100">“Believe me, I won’t!” Drew readily agrees.

It would be a lot cleaner to use soap and just pretend...//  “Ahh…”  This moment has gone far beyond pretend.

As Drew’s phone hovers near your face you strike a sexy pose.  The flash brightens the dark room for a split second.  In an instant it is done.  You have mixed feelings.  //I seem to have crossed another line…  It isn’t my fault I feel like this!  It is this awful...awesome… body.//

“Are you okay, Taylor?”

You snap out of your internal debate.  “Uh… yeah… kind of… not really…  Honestly, I don’t know anymore.  Just take the fucking picture, Drew.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“It’s still //maid,//” you correct him with a blush.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1332" name="Make a cute face for Drew" tags="" position="10398,33192" size="100,100">You grab Drew at his base and milk out the remainders of his load.  You then scoop all the cum on your face into your mouth.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bpic.jpg&quot;&gt;

You stick out your tongue and show off your mouth’s contents for Drew and the camera.  The bitter, fishy taste is forever locked within your memory.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bfacial.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Mmm!”

You then swallow Drew’s sperm in one big gulp.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bfacial2.jpg&quot;&gt;
Drew appears to die and go to heaven.  He snaps one final picture before flopping over on the couch and falling back asleep.

After Drew’s cock and home is clean, you end your maid service and decide to head home.  Before you leave, you pause near the bathroom.

&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
Evan grins at your honesty.  You continue the long drive home.  You put on your sunglasses and stare at the rolling, green scenery while you daydream and reflect on how your relationship with Evan has changed so much in the past few weeks.  You stare out at the strange horizon as it takes on a reddish caste as the evening light gradually dwindles.  //A red horizon... Mmmm...// the strange coloration mesmerizes you for a moment.  You look at Evan, framed in the same reddish light.  You can’t remember ever feeling quite like you do now.  You are undeniably mixed up, but within all the confusion, you realize you are having a great time with Evan.  //A magic scarlet sunset….And I get to share it with Evan….//  You realize that being around Evan is both a relaxing and unnerving experience.  Around Evan you aren’t quite sure how to feel.

You try and distract yourself by studying the flaming horizon.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/redsunset.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Red… Red… Red… A glowing sunset, the color of blood...and passion… damn it….//  Your dirty mind seems to be be permanently tainted. You shake your head but cannot help but daydream about a wreath of flames.

You catch Evan staring at you.  [[“Taylor...your hair…”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1335" name="Remain silent." tags="" position="2748,18939" size="100,100">You don’t know what to say to that so you say nothing.  You feel woefully confused.  You need time to think.  Agitating Evan serves no purpose if you cannot communicate yourself properly.

The rest of the trip finishes uneventfully, lost in a blur of rolling dark hills.

Once back in the city, Evan drops you off.  He helps you carry your gear inside.

You awkwardly thank him for the ride and he departs.

Once alone, you instantly feel anxious as your rational mindset returns with a vengeance.

“What the hell have I done?”  Your relationship with Evan has progressed to a new pinnacle of weirdness.  You recall kissing Evan and shiver, as disgust, shame, and arousal battle for control of your emotions.

All your “physical activity” during the weekend has left you sore and exhausted.

[[You drag yourself upstairs and pass out on your bed.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1336" name="You drag yourself upstairs and pass out on your bed." tags="" position="2534,19140" size="100,100">When next you open your eyes you appear to be in a hazy room.  You look around and are startled to find Evan beside you.  He is completely naked, his hard penis pressing into your side.

“Hey, babe!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dick.jpg&quot;&gt;
You wake up in a cold sweat.  The last fading image in your mind is Evan’s penis.  You shake your head.  “Fuck… now I am dreaming about Evan’s dick?  I am definitely losing my mind…  We have been spending way too much time together!”

You find it impossible to fall back asleep so you decide to get up early.

You heat up some frozen waffles for breakfast and head to school.

You meet Evan inside Deter’s hall before class.  Drew is conspicuously absent.

“Where’s Drew?” you wonder as you eye his empty seat.

“He probably just ate a bad hamburger,” Evan jokes.

“I don’t think Drew has ever eaten a burger he didn’t like…”

Evan laughs.  [[“Speaking of food, how about we get lunch off campus later?”]] he suggests.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1337" name="“Right now?  Sure!”" tags="" position="2497,11494" size="100,100">“It will look great on the big screen,” Evan predicts as he sets up the dvd.

As the alien title screen appears you feel your excitement rise.

“Let’s just stay in tonight and marathon these aliens to death!” Evan loudly suggests.

It is pretty hard to argue against the suggestion. 

“Let’s do it!” you reply, suddenly feeling a bit embarrassed about your enthusiasm.  //Let’s do it!  Fuck why does everything sound so dirty in my mind?//

With a clink, Evan produces two surprisingly clean glasses and pours them from full of wine from a bottle you didn’t even know he had.  You begin to feel a strange feeling of deja vu. 

“Trying to get me drunk again?”

“Hah, maybe.  You are definitely more fun and laid back with a drink or two in you.”

You cross your arms and shoot Evan an angry look.

“Hey it was on sale too!  We can’t just let it go to waste.  Oh!  Quiet!  The movie is starting,” he says, cutting you off with the sound from the TV as he presses the play button on a nearby remote.

The movie is glorious.  You laugh your ass off, whoop in delight, and enjoy nearly every minute of it.  //This day was looking a bit depressing; I never dreamed it would end with ultimate aliens!//
Evan was kind of sweet and thoughtful, in a weird sort of way.
[[Watch the rare alien flick]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1338" name="camera suddenly flashes again." tags="" position="2355,12945" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanpose.png&quot; data-raw=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Now that you started posing you can’t readily stop.  You duckface and give peace signs, turning your head side to side so Evan can get shots of both sides of your creamy face. You sitck out your cummy tongue.
You then cup your breasts and stare smokily into the camera while Evan gleefully snaps another pic.

//Ugghh… //you suddenly feel embarrassed, conscious of your face rapidly flushing.  //Why am I acting like a fucking porn star? // It is true Evan seems to love the moment, but you don’t quite think that was enough justification.  Only seconds have passed, and you already feel like you have made a grave mistake.  //A moment passes...but a picture nowadays is forever.//

“Evan, I got to go,” you tell your friend, as you duck into the bathroom.  You glance at the mirror and your big, dark coloured but bright eyes stare back.  The second thing you notice is your dishevelled hair...and the white, rapidly crusting semen that seems to cover most of your face.  //Fuck!  I can’t believe I let Evan take pictures of me like that.  Seriously - what the fuck is wrong with me?//  You //really// hope you don’t end up on some creepy website for weirdos to jack off to.

“I was thinking something a little fancier.  There is that taphouse near the student union building.  I heard they have great food.”

“And beer,” you add.

By the time noon rolls around you are salivating in anticipation.

You meet Evan near the taphouse.  The two of you enjoy a tasty lunch, washed down by local ale.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pub.jpeg&quot;&gt;
When the check comes due, Evan pays for both of you without hesitation.  You notice he leaves a generous cash tip.

“Thanks, Evan.”

“Huh?  Oh, no problem!  It was delicious… and the company was great too,” Evan adds with a smile.

“I will see you after class?” Evan’s voice rises at the end, making his statement a question.

You briefly consider Evan’s offer.  Your first instinct is to accept but you also are aware that your relationship with Evan is heading past the point of no return.

//I need to figure out how the fuck to change back before its too late!//  You look at Evan’s uncomprehending grin and feel queasy.  //My sex drive is revved up though…  Maybe I can get some research in after Evan comes over.  It would be a waste to masturbate, right?//

[[“See you after class!”]]
[[“Maybe later in the week…”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1340" name="“See you after class!”" tags="" position="2544,19292" size="100,100">You meet Evan a few hours later.

Evan arrives at your front door holding a plastic shopping bag.

“What’s in there?”

“I know things have been a bit weird lately but I have found the solution.  Check this out!” Evan says as he reveals his package.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/48packevan.jpg&quot;&gt;
“It’s a forty-eight pack!” he explains.  “Of condoms!”

//I can see that!//  “You expect us to have sex //forty eight// times?” 

“I bet we will go through this box pretty quickly.  Then I will just buy us another one.”

“Don’t just decide this on your own!”

“Oh?”  Evan wiggles his eyebrows at you.  “I am totally okay with creampies too!  There is nothing better than cumming inside your sweet pussy,” Evan attests.

You barely resist the urge to smack Evan.  “That’s not what I meant, you idiot!”

Evan seems lost in his own world.  “Do you want to test a few of these out?”

[[“I guess…”]]
[[“No, thank you.”]]

Evan begins to strip too and soon you are both naked.

A second later, your pussy is stuffed with Evan’s manhood.  You lower yourself down onto Evan’s stiff cock.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/condomfuck1.jpg&quot;&gt;

After a rigorous ten minutes of sex, you bend over and give Evan easier access.  Without further urging, Evan begins to fuck you doggy style with long, deep strokes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/condomfuck2.jpg&quot;&gt;

“Oh I can’t take it!  I am uhhhh…..” Evan groans as you feel his cock pulse and piston inside you.  Yet instead of the now familiar spreading warmth, you feel no such release due to the condom’s barrier.  Regardless, you cum on Evan’s sheathed cock just as he milks the last of his cum inside you.

Evan withdraws himself with a lewd squelching noise.  He then removes his condom and lays it down on the bed.

[[You stare at the full condom.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1343" name="“No, thank you.”" tags="" position="2700,19387" size="100,100">“No, I am good.  I at least have a tiny bit of self control.”

“Hoooooollllllyy fuuuuuck you are //tight//, Taylor!  The way you are gripping my cock right now is fucking marvelous.”

Mitch begins to slide in and out of your tight hole, filling you with his huge penis.  //It is so big!  Fucccccccccccck!!// You cannot bear it.  It is too much for such a small cavity to contain.  Yet you do your best to clench your teeth and attempt to endure.

Mitch uses you like a piece of pleasure meat.

“Ahhhh…….No….Fucking why?  Ahhh….”  //Why is this happening to me?//

“You are only making me enjoy this more, Taylor!  Keep yelping, bitch!”

The man you hate the most in the world has his cock thrusting in and out of your ass.  You can do nothing except try to relax your defenseless hole and let Mitch have his way.  Mitch&#39;s cock is so hard you are sure if you try and resist you will probably not be able to walk for a week.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/anal2.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As his penis surges in and out your ass, you grab the sheets and ball your fists.  You almost wish you had a fucking stick to bite down upon.  Mitch doesn’t care about your pleasure, seeking only his own.  //This is….so….gay...// 

“Ahnn Ahnn...Ahh….Hnnnnnnnnng!”  You cannot believe you have a dick in your ass.  Any dick would be bad enough, yet to make a horrible thing even much worse, it is //Mitch&#39;s// dick.

//Fuck...Fuck...Fuck...//

Mitch echos your thoughts, his pelvis slapping into your shuddering, quivering ass with abandon.

“Please…”

“Uh!  Fuck, Taylor, your ass is so damn tight.”

“Please…”

“Please what?  Fuck you harder?  Sure thing, Taylor!” he says through his ragged breathing.  Instead of showing you mercy, he proceeds to pound at your ass even harder.

//Wow… I feel so much better knowing this stuff isn’t let loose inside of me...//  Sex with a condom doesn’t feel quite as good as skin on skin but the peace of mind is more than worth the trade off in your mind.  //Way less mess too… I just hope this doesn’t encourage us to do it even more frequently.//

“Oh, for a sec there I thought you wanted something lewd from me.”

Evan blushes.  “Well… it is a //costume// party…” 

You roll your eyes at Evan’s transparent intentions.  “And you want me to wear something special…” you guess.

Evan nods and hands you some small animal ears.  “What am I supposed to be?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/foxears.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Maybe a cute kitty-cat or a fox…?”

“Hmm.  Hot girls have always had easy-mode costume options.”

“I know, right?  You just need some animal ears and lingerie.”

“I am NOT wearing lingerie to a party… or at all….”

“Whoa, calm down!  How about a slinky little black dress then?”

“And why don’t //you// dress up as a ballerina?”

Evan blinks.  “I don’t have the figure for it.”

“The //tail!?//  Oh, man…  Is it velcro?” you hopefully enquire.  “It better be fucking velcro.”

“Um.  Not exactly,” Evan vaguely replies.  You notice he is having trouble looking you in the eyes.

“What is it?  C’mon, out with it!”

“It is a tail… //butt plug//,” Evan admits.

“Huh!?  No… //just no.//  No fucking way. No fucking way!” you repeat.

[[Evan brandishes the fox tail at you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1349" name="Evan brandishes the fox tail at you." tags="" position="2548,19788" size="100,100">You cringe and jump out of the way.  “//Ew!// Don’t touch me with that!” 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/foxtail.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Oh come on!  It is totally cute!” Evan comments as he decides which end of the fox tail to harass you with.

Evan chases you around the room, tickling you with the furry fox tail and prodding you with the other end.  “Fuck, Evan!  Get away from me!  What the hell is wrong with you?  Why did you even bring that thing?”

“Well I figured you’re foxy, so why not get you a fox tail?”

You facepalm.  “Evan, I really wonder about you sometimes…”

“I am sorry.  You just fuel my imagination.  I saw those ears and the tail… and I just had to see what you look like with them on!”

Evan uses the lull of the conversation to sneak closer to you.  Before you can react, he wraps you in his lean, muscular arms.

“I got you…”  Evan begins to kiss your neck and you find that each subsequent breath is deeper than the last.

[[Evan’s kisses migrate up your jaw to your lips.]]

“Will you try this out for me?  Please, Taylor… you know you’re my best friend.  I’d do anything for you.  I always hoped that feeling was mutual.”

“Err…”

“Aren’t you curious?   I bet it will feel good.  Plus, you have already had my dick inside you…  not bashing my own hygiene here, but I think this is a bit cleaner and uh, less intrusive?”

“Evan… I don’t want things going in or around my butt.”

“Aww!  But you have the cutest ass ever.”

“It’s not happening!”

“Aw, why not?  What’s the big deal?”

“It’s dirty and… would feel really weird and fuck, it’s just //wrong//, okay?  We are both dudes.  This is not something I am even curious about.  Just give it a rest, would ya?”

Evan seems determined to convince you.  “Well, how can you knock something before you try it?  And if you are worried about cleanliness, just have a shower first,” Evan advises.

“I… I don’t know.”  //Why is Evan asking me this shit?  He can’t really want to… Yeah, nevermind...//

“You know, I remember that you used to hate //chocolate.//  Now you love it.  Let’s just experiment for a bit and see how it goes, okay?” Evan verbally pushes you forward.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1351" name="Evan continues to wear you down until you agree to his request." tags="" position="2548,19940" size="100,100">You have a hot shower.  While the water washes over you, you run a soft finger around your anus.  You then push upward and gently work your fingertip inside.  The firm flesh resists your efforts.

You rub your asshole while enjoying your shower.  The sensations are odd, but not completely unpleasant.  Your exploration confirms what you suspected: anal play isn’t for you.

“So, feeling clean?” Evan asks you when you return.

“Yeah… I am having second thoughts…”

“Well, can I have a little peek?  No touching without your permission!  Scout’s honor.”

“I guess I took that shower for a reason…”  You lie down on the bed and expose your pussy and asshole for Evan’s viewing pleasure.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/showoff2.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Holy fuck, Taylor!  Hnnngghh… This view!  Wow…  Seriously, this is the last sight I want to see before I die.”  

“Evan, please shut up.  You’re not helping.”

“I bought this too,” Evan says as he produces a tiny bottle of what appears to be lubricant.

[[“Umm… What the hell?  You just carry that shit around in your pocket?”]]

In your current position you find it difficult to object.  “Whatever.”

Evan rubs a generous amount of lube onto your asshole.  He toys with its outline, sending strange shocks coursing through your body.

Evan then slowly works the cold stainless steel head of the buttplug into your tiny anus.  

Your ass is just too tight.

“Wait, Evan!  Let me do it.  You’re too rough.”  You take hold of the tail and try and push it inside you but you realize you will have to take it slow.  You move the point back and forth, pushing a little bit deeper with every pass.

Evan wastes no time before he begins to gently fuck your ass.

“Evan, stop!  That feels weird!  Just leave it alone!”

Evan stops.  “Yeah, you have to get used to it.  The party isn’t long but it might get uncomfortable.”

“Wait!  You want me to wear this… //in public!?//  At the party?  Dude!”

“No one will know… except me, hehehe.  Isn’t that a hot idea?”

“No!  It sounds like a literal pain in the ass!”

“Puhleaaaaase?  I will buy you dinner any restaurant in the city and I will eat you out any time you want!”

“That doesn’t sound fair.”  //Eating and fucking…?  God damnit, Evan.//  The weirdest thing of all is that Evan’s offer has a degree of appeal.  Evan’s simplicity is apparently part of his charm.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1354" name="Wear the buttplug to the party" tags="" position="2692,20187" size="100,100">On Halloween night you get dressed and, after an awkward waddle, meet Evan outside the party’s address (which is luckily nearby).

As you approach the house, you note that the somewhat drunken festivities have already attracted all manner of costumed students.  You spot king kong and a mob boss standing next to several trendy character clones ripped from popular TV.

With Evan at your side dressed like a James Bond wannabe, you begin to mingle at the party.

“This is my foxy friend, Taylor,” Evan proudly introduces you to several small groups.  You exchange introductions with a long line of people.  Evan seems to enjoy showing you off.

“Hello Foxy Taylor, I amazed Evan has a … friend like you,” remarks one young man who can’t seem to peel his eyes off your cleavage.  You can’t blame the man for ogling you in your costume.

Many of Evan’s acquaintances appear openly jealous.  Their reaction is pleasing in a way, but you find yourself fighting the soft sense of elation, [[lest you fall too deeply into your new, extroverted role.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1355" name="Refuse and tape on the tail." tags="" position="2391,20184" size="100,100">Tape?  That doesn&#39;t sound like fun.

You find yourself having a surprisingly good time.  For brief intervals you even forget you have something //up your ass//.  As you sip some obviously spiked punch, you eye several attractive women.  All of them seem to have put far more effort into their costumes than most.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/partybabes.jpg&quot;&gt;
Evan glances at the girls but his eyes soon return to you.  That’s the moment it hits you: //a lot //of people are looking at you right now.

You begin to sweat.  Your anus clamps down your tail plug making you jump and squirm.  You see Evan get ambushed by a pair of jocks and are about to rescue him when you get interrupted.

“Hey babe!” a muscular man dressed as a greek soldier greets you.  You take one look at his bare chest and do a one-eighty. 

You get another glass of punch and listen to the music while waiting for Evan.

“I love your tail!” one of the party girls says [[as she yanks on your tail, and by extension, your buttplug.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1357" name="as she yanks on your tail, and by extension, your buttplug." tags="" position="2692,20340" size="100,100">“Y--eeep!  I -uh, thanks!” you manage to reply before shimmying away to safety.

Throughout the night people keep incessantly playing with your tail.  Everytime it happens you tense up.  The ceaseless prodding shamefully stimulates your ass.  It hurts.  It is uncomfortable.  And it feels good all at the same time.  For some reason you can’t identify, you feel yourself getting turned on. //It is probably because I am wearing this slutty outfit and a sex toy in public… Fucking damnit, this is such a slutty thing to do!  Why in the fuck did I agree to this?  Evan’s perversion is infecting me!//  You suspect even Julie would have more dignity and taste when choosing a costume.

“Ahoy there!” shouts a voice from behind you, interrupting your reverie.

“Whoa--yiiip!” you shiver as a creepy looking man dressed as a pirate gleefully fondles your tail.  //Oh shit...//  You feel yourself heating up.  The constant stimulation, the humiliation, the exhiliaration of exhibition, all combine to turn you on.

//Having my ass played with feels so fucking good!  How the heck is that possible?  I don’t want to enjoy having something up my butt!//  To make matters worse, being molested by a creepy pirate is just plain messed up.

The pirate continues to stroke your tail until he slides a finger into your underwear and reaches the base.  You look up in horror as a look of realization spreads across the buccaneer’s face.

“You’re wearing a butt plug!  You huge, foxy slut!”

“S-shut up!  Not so loud.  And don’t touch me, you fuckin’ bilge rat!”

The pirate balks.  “But yer askin’ for it!  You’re so wet.  You’re clearly in heat, Miss Fox.  Let’s go take care of you.”  The man grabs your arm and begins to lead you away from the main group.

His bold actions delay your own.  You decide to:
[[Call for help]]
[[Try and break free alone]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1358" name="Call for help" tags="" position="2545,20386" size="100,100">“Fuck off!  HELLLLLLLLLLLL---ahgh!” your scream is cut off when the pirate’s hand wraps around your mouth.

You bite down and snag the meat of one of your attacker’s fingers.  You taste blood as the pirate shrieks in pain.  The distraction lasts only for a moment.  The pirate cocks back his arm to punch you.  Time seems to slow down as you envision your face being pummelled.

//Whack!//

The pirate suddenly crumples to the ground.  The next thing you know, Evan is beside you.

“Are you okay?  What a fucking dick!  No one hurts my fox girl!” Evan begins to viciously kick the prone man until you pull him away.

“Evan, it’s okay.”

“No, it isn’t okay!  You could have been hurt or… worse.”

“I am fine, thanks to you…”

“Do you want to go upstairs?  I know of an empty bedroom with a lock on the door…”

[[“I thought you would never ask!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1359" name="Try and break free alone" tags="" position="2843,20382" size="100,100">“Let go of me, you asshole!” 

You try and shake the man off but you find yourself hugely outclassed in strength and stature.

You are about to call for help when the man covers your mouth and pins you against a nearby wall.

“You obviously want this just as much as I do.  You’re dripping wet and you have something up your ass in front of all these people.  That gives you a thrill, doesn’t it?”

“No, no…” your muffled cry is barely sufficient to reach your own ears, let alone rise above the booming music.  You try and squirm away but only manage to take a few steps further away from the crowd.

“That’s right, in here,” the pirate motions at a door.

“Fu--” you barely get a swear off before the pirate manhandles you into a nearby laundry room.  He pushes you firmly down onto a pile of dirty clothes.  He then closes the door and wedges a folding chair against the doorknob.

You are now utterly trapped… with a horny pirate!

“Alright, now where were we, you slutty little fox?”

[[“Please, it was my friend’s idea.  I didn’t mean to…”]]

Hah, that’s what I thought.”  The pirate rolls up your dress and rips your sodden panties off your in one fluid motion.  He then rubs your underwear over his face and then slips them into his pocket as a souvenir of this humiliating encounter.

//No!  Fucking why is this happening to me!?//  Having sex with Evan was weird enough, but being raped by a stranger in a pirate costume is in a whole new realm of fucked-upness.

Eager to pillage your pussy, the pirate whips out his huge banana shaped cock.

You stare at it in disbelief.  //This can’t be real!//

Your internal protests do nothing to stall the pirate’s onslaught.  The curved penis pierces into your hot pussy, filling you to your utter limits in a single thrust.

“Hnngh… Ahh, ow, ah…  No, no way...”  

//Schlick, schlick...//  The pirate’s penis thrusts in and out of your pussy.

[[“Ohh fuck!  My dick feels like it is in cock-heaven!  You have a wonder-pussy, fox-babe!”]]

//I just need to detach myself and this will all be over soon...//

The pirate fucks you long and hard until you gradually find yourself going along with his actions.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/foxystyle.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The pirate fucks you foxy-style until you lose your senses.  You give in to the building pleasure and cum hard as the man massages the tail into your asshole while thrusting madly into your burning pussy.

You feel the semen splash into your womb.  The pirate withdraws, leaving you plundered and splayed outon a pile of dirty laundry.

[[After the Halloween party…]]

Soon you are locked behind the privacy of a thin wooden door.

“Why is there a couch in here?”

“It is a student rental…  Crap accumulates,” Evan answers.  “Bed or couch?”

You eye the bed which appears dirtier than the couch.  The messy, crud filled room does little to reduce your arousal.  “Do you have a condom?” you ask Evan.

Evan’s face falls.  “No, I… left them all at your place,” he answers, crestfallen.

You are too horny to demonstrate any self control.  “Fuck…  I guess one more time wouldn’t hurt…”

“Oh my god, you’re the best, Taylor.  I fucking love you.”

You blink twice.  “What did you just say?”

“Nothing!  Let’s get-it-on!”

[[A minute later, you stand before Evan wearing nothing but makeup, fox ears, and your foxy tail.]]

“Holy shit, Taylor…  you’re a kitsune goddess.”  

//A what!?//  “Shut up, Evan.  Your goddess commands you.”

Evan obeys your order by kissing you.

“Mmmm…” you both moan together.  //I shouldn’t like this… but I do… Fuck it!//  You kiss Evan back as Evan’s arms wrap around you, his big hands enveloping your small, round bum and giving your soft buns a little squeeze.

Evan’s fingertips brush up against your tail and you shiver.

Evan pushes in the base of the plug and moves it in a circular motion.

“Uhhhnnnn….”

Evan withdraws slightly.  “You look so hot right now…  Let’s go to the couch.”  

[[You find the suggestion agreeable.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1365" name="You find the suggestion agreeable." tags="" position="2691,20642" size="100,100">You impale yourself on Evan’s dick and ride him like a fox in heat.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/foxyride.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

As Evan’s penis surges in and out of you, you feel a subtle change in your mindset.  You grind yourself against Evan with increasing urgency as you chase your pleasure until you capture it.  You feel yourself go limp as you convulse and cum with Evan thrusting inside you.

After you regain a bit of control, you realize that instead of being sated your desires have only been inflamed.

[[You dismount Evan and lie down on the couch, breasts down, bum up.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1366" name="You dismount Evan and lie down on the couch, breasts down, bum up." tags="" position="2547,20696" size="100,100">Evan needs no further cue and strips off the last of his clothes in a flash.  He then takes position behind your rear.  You look back at Evan’s petrified penis with anticipation.  “Time to get some tail!” your friend quips as he begins to enter you. 

“Ohhh wow…  Fuck, you feel so great inside me,” you say to Evan.  Your words make Evan’s eyes shine.

Evan starts to bang you from behind.  You feel every inch of his manhood fill the aching void within you.  You are so wet that Evan has no difficulty sliding in and out of you.  But Evan takes his time, letting you experience the strange but lovely feeling of having your genitals penetrated and spread apart by a penis. 

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/halloweentay.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Mrroow!  Ahhh!”  The double stimulation, anal and vaganial coupled with your earlier arousal coalesces into an instant storm of passion.  You cum after a few pathetic strokes, clamping down on Evan’s girth as your body responds without regard.

“Whoa…  Uh oh… OHhhh...” Your orgasm triggers Evan’s as well.  With one last womb kissing thrust, he withdraws his cock.

The next thing you know, [[it is being jerked in front of your face.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1367" name="it is being jerked in front of your face." tags="" position="2699,20794" size="100,100">In the midst of your orgasm you cannot deny Evan a similar if lesser pleasure.  Your lips open and you take Evan inside your mouth just as he ejaculates, spraying the inside of your mouth with his sperm.

You look up at Evan with cum dripping down your tongue and discover that you want more.  You want more sex.  If having more sex means tasting more of Evan’s cum, well that is a small price for admission to such a fantastic ride.

You greedily swallow Evan&#39;s cum.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/foxyswallow.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A sudden sense of delirium seizes hold of you.  “More… give me more, Evan Moore… More cock.... He he he...” you murmur to Evan.

“Anything you want, Taylor.  I will give you whatever you want!” Evan declares as he mounts you again.

You and your best friend fuck long and hard into the night, slipping out of the Halloween party hours after nearly [[all the other guests had passed out.]]

You kiss and suck on your friend’s penis.  Drew’s cock spasms while you hold him steady within the hot moist flesh of your mouth.

“Okay… let’s put these, uh, //distractions// to use,” you say as you heft your ample breasts.

You smother his cock with the soft flesh of your breasts.  Your actions obviously turn your partner on.

“This is… the greatest feeling ever!” Drew encourages you.  As you attempt to pleasure Drew with your pillowy boobs, you realize that your vertical movements are awkward from your low position.

You pause momentarily.  “This would be more comfortable if I was on my back,” you decide.

You stand up and stretch out.  You then lie down on the couch beside Drew.  Drew watches you but stays frozen in place.

“What are you waiting for?” you ask Drew while gesturing at your tits.  When you see your friend’s hesitation you add, “It’s fine.  Just don’t crush me.  Come here.”

Drew awkwardly respositions himself, kneeling above your chest.  “I am sorry, Taylor… I have never done this before.”

Drew’s words make you blush.  “This is a first for me too,” you reply.

As you watch his penis move back and forth, you become conscious of how painfully erect your nipples are.  You reach out and touch them, only to be shocked by their sensitivity.

“Mmmmm….  My boobs feel good…”

“Yes, yes they do!” Drew readily agrees.

You cup your breasts and squeeze them more firmly around Drew’s flesh.

Drew groans as he frantically thrusts, shooting the first splash of his ejaculation into your mouth before filling your cleavage with a vast puddle of milky sperm.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/titfuckpov.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Drew admires his handiwork with a look of such accomplishment you decide you cannot bear to disappoint him.

You resist the urge to spit out the vile tasting fluid.

As you lean your head back you cannot help but inhale the odor of Drew’s stinky semen.

After Drew has been licked clean, you find yourself with a familiar hard problem.

Your actions have caused Drew to become aroused //again//.

“It got hard again…” you observe with irritation.

Drew seems distressed.  “I am sorry, Taylor!  I can’t help it!”

“It is okay.  We can keep going.”

His wet cock slides back between your warm breasts.  Your saliva has already lubricated Drew’s shaft so that it increases the ease of Drew&#39;s actions.

//Sluuup, schlooop..//

Your position provides perfect alignment for Drew&#39;s ejecatulation to spray directly onto your face.  You take the next cumshot like a champ.

You check your phone, noting there is still over an hour until your bodyguards return.

//I&#39;d grab a cup a drink or something but that would probably draw unnecessary attention.// You are free to explore the city but don&#39;t want to embarrass Natalie in public.

You notice the greenery of a nearby park and decide it would be a suitable hideout for a bit.

Although you still draw a fair bit of male attention, no one seems to recognize you. You find a secluded bench in the corner of the park and sit down to relax.

You play for a bit until you hear someone approaching.

A young man, more an overgrown kid, rushes up to you.

&quot;Oh my God! You&#39;re Natalie Prynn! You&#39;re my favorite actress!&quot; the man exclaims. His backpack and jaw drop the ground as he admires you.

//Here we go again...//

[[Play along|natplayalong]]
[[&quot;Sorry, you&#39;re mistaken - but I get that a lot.&quot;|It is time to return to Natalie&#39;s apartment]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1376" name="Let him take a few more" tags="" position="7987,23305" size="100,100">&quot;Fine, whatever.  Just hurry up.&quot;

&quot;You are an angel, Natalie.&quot;

The photographer snaps away while you put minimal effort into posing.

&quot;Time for a costume change?&quot; the photographer suggests.

&quot;Uh…&quot;  You eye a nearby clock and find it to be surprisingly early.

&quot;If you would just humor me and try on another outfit… I would be indebted to you for all eternity!  Please save me, Natalie!&quot;

You are unsure what to make of the photographer&#39;s exaggerated manner of speaking.  //This guy just keeps pushing me… I think it might be time to call it a night.//

[[Try on the photographer&#39;s new outfit.]]
[[Refuse and call it a night.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1377" name="Try on the photographer&#39;s new outfit." tags="" position="8139,23355" size="100,100">You return to the changing room with the photographer who quickly picks out a new outfit for you.  The photographer walks around with a visible boner, while paying the thing no attention.  His actions remind you vaguely of Evan...

He holds out a surprisingly revealing summer dress held up by two thin pink straps.

You change and return to the set where you spend a monotonous fifteen minutes posing.

The photographer waves you over.  &quot;Let&#39;s see how we did…&quot; 

[[The photographer shows you your pictures.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1378" name="even for her." tags="" position="12133,24351" size="100,100">Julie’s offer seems to be earnest.

Julie giggles.  “Taylor, I am going to take your silence and your bright red face as assent.”

“Julie…  I don’t even know what to say.”

“It’s okay.  I don’t mind sharing.”

“You would //share// Ryan with me?”  //She’s acting like he is a umbrella or something...//

“Of course!”

You fail to limit your skepticism.  “Julie, you once stabbed with a fork because I took the last piece of chicken, so forgive me for doubting that you would share your boyfriend with me.”

“Well he isn’t //your// boyfriend.  He’s //mine.//  Taylor, you are just horny is all.  Ryan is pretty cool, so it is completely natural to find him attractive… but I would only be willing to share a little bit… and only certain parts.  You need to get laid.   I will share Ryan’s cock but not his heart, okay?”

Julie’s bizarre proposition leaves you flabbergasted.  Mind spinning, you find yourself nodding absently in agreement.

Julie grins at you.  “You won’t regret this.  Sex is fun.  Sex with Ryan is //really// fun!”

//Yeah, I know...//  You keep your guilty thoughts to yourself.

“What about Ryan?” [[you ask when you finally manage to find your tongue.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1379" name="you ask when you finally manage to find your tongue." tags="" position="11989,24405" size="100,100">“What about him?  As if he would turn down a threesome with us!  Trust me, Ryan isn’t gay.”  

You wince.  

“What’s wrong?”

“Ryan isn’t gay… but what about me?  Why do I have these … feelings?”

Julie sympathetically pats your shoulder.  “It’s the Roux libido, a blessing and a curse,” Julie sagely answers.  “Besides, I wouldn’t categorize liking Ryan as a homosexual thing… he’s just that good looking, but especially not with the way you are now.  I can clearly see that you are getting used to your new life.  Being a woman is awesome, Taylor.  I just want to be a good big sis and help you open the door to an immense world of pleasure.  If Ryan’s cock is the key, then I will set us up a date for the grand unlocking.”

You open your mouth to speak but find you have exhausted your supply of words.

You give Julie an awkward hug and then withdraw to your room.

Twenty minutes later you receive a [[text from Ryan.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1380" name="text from Ryan." tags="" position="12133,24507" size="100,100">“So I just had the weirdest conversation with Julie…” it reads.

“Ditto,” you message back.

A second later, your phone rings with Ryan’s name appearing on the caller ID.

“Hi,” you answer, suddenly feeling shy.

“Hey, Taylor.  So… it is true then?  What Julie said?  You’re onboard with this… arrangement?”

“Uhhhh…. I guess so.”

“How in the hell did you convince her?”

“It was mostly her idea,” you explain.

Ryan is clearly surprised.  “But you’re okay with … what Julie proposed?”

[[“If it means we can have sex without sneaking around… yes,”]] you bluntly answer.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1381" name="“If it means we can have sex without sneaking around… yes,”" tags="" position="11989,24561" size="100,100">You can picture Ryan’s smile.  “I won’t argue with that.  Are you ready for tomorrow then?”

“//Tomorrow!?//”

“Julie said, “the earlier the better.””

“She is such a strange woman….”

You and Ryan make small talk for a few minutes before he steers the call to its conclusion.

“Okay, well I am going to sleep early tonight because I want to have maximum stamina for tomorrow because I am going to rock both of your worlds.”

//Oh wow...// “Looking forward to it!” you reply before wincing at how eager you sound.  //This might be fun... except for the weirdness of having sex in the presence of my sister...//  

That night you find it difficult to fall asleep for your mind is filled with illicit thoughts.

The next day, you wait anxiously for [[Julie and Ryan to arrive.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1382" name="Julie and Ryan to arrive." tags="" position="12137,24663" size="100,100">Your sister gets home first.  “Nervous, Taylor?”

“You have no idea…”

Julie cackles.  She teases you a bit before hopping in the shower.

You wait impatiently for an hour with progressively escalating anxiety.

As soon as Ryan arrives, you feel the tension level ratchet up even more.  Julie greets her boyfriend with a kiss and leads him into the living room.  

You try and smile at Ryan but find it difficult to meet his steady gaze.

The three of you start with a round of red wine.  You and Julie sit down on the couch, flanking Ryan from either side.

Ryan compliments the flavor of the wine but Julie immediately changes the topic.

[[“Taylor, have you ever seen a penis in real life before?”]] Julie asks you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1383" name="“Taylor, have you ever seen a penis in real life before?”" tags="" position="11991,24713" size="100,100">“W-what?” you sputter. The oddly blunt question catches you off guard.

//Technically, yes, because I have seen my own...//  The reminder turns knots in your stomach.

“See, isn’t Taylor cute?  Look at her blushing!

Julie turns to Ryan.  “That’s your cue, sweetie.”

Ryan turns his head side to side, appraising each of you in turn.  He seems a tad conflicted as well but any inhibitions are quickly drowned out by lustful thoughts.

“This is okay, right Taylor?” Ryan asks you.

Julie answers for you.  “She is totally on board!  Taylor is just shy is all.”

Your eyes finally meet Ryan’s.  You feel yourself burn up until you enter an almost fever-like state.

Ryan stands up with a bemused smile.  He undoes his belt and slides down his pants.

Julie grabs him from behind and slides a hand underneath Ryan’s boxer’s elastic band.  She then fondles Ryan’s swelling manhood right in front of you.  Julie pulls down Ryan’s underwear as she draws him down onto the couch.

“Well, what do you think, Taylor?  Pretty nice dick, isn’t it?” [[Julie questions you with flashing eyes.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1384" name="Julie questions you with flashing eyes." tags="" position="12134,24806" size="100,100">“I, uh…”  The whole scenario is so shocking and weird that, despite your mental preparations, you feel yourself slipping into a state of insanity.  For what else could you call it?  You are about to do something //woefully wrong// while your sister eggs you on.  For some reason you ended up here and you have done nothing to alter course.

Julie takes the initiative, grabbing your hand and repositions it on Ryan’s erection.  With Julie’s urging, your slender, pale hand pumps up and down the loose skin of Ryan’s shaft.

“Oh my…” you murmur under your breath.  Julie catches the sentiment though and giggles.

“I know!  What a wonderful dick!” she comments.  “Ryan is pretty gifted in more ways than one.”

“Aw, thanks Julie,” Ryan says.

“Shut up, Ryan.  I am trying to convince Taylor to be a good girl and suck your dick.  Just be content to be our prop for a little while longer.”

To your surprise, instead of objecting, Ryan readily agrees.  “No problem,” he says as he leans back, content to let the “cousins” [[work together.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1385" name="work together." tags="" position="11990,24852" size="100,100">“Get up close and personal, Taylor!” Julie encourages you as she pushes your face closer to Ryan’s groin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryanweirdview.gif&quot;&gt;
You get a good look at the underside of Ryan’s dick.  From your viewpoint, looking up at Ryan you feel submissive and sexy.

You decided earlier to feign sexual ignorance, lest you betray your secret with Ryan.  So you stare at Ryan’s penis, attempting to acclimate yourself to the awkward tension pervading the room.  

“Hurry up, Taylor!  Geez, you’d think you have never seen a weiner before.  I know you took sex-ed in school.  That’s all this is.  Ryan and I are just your sexy teachers.”  You don’t feel like you are being chaperoned.  [[Julie is clearly intent on being a participant, not a mere observer to your pleasure.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1386" name="Julie is clearly intent on being a participant, not a mere observer to your pleasure." tags="" position="12134,24958" size="100,100">“Geez, Taylor…  Put some effort into it.  Like this!”  Julie leans forward and begins to demonstrate her erotic skills.  She sucks on Ryan’s balls while massaging his shaft, alternating between kisses, tongue, and hand until Ryan is moaning in ecstasy.

Julie’s skill impresses you.  A part of you is even jealous that she is able to effortlessly afford Ryan such pleasure.  You suddenly have an urge to compete.  //I won’t lose to Julie!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sisteamwork.jpg&quot;&gt;
You join Julie on the floor in front of Ryan.  You begin a sexy rivalry, competing to give Ryan the best moment of his life.

At first Julie seems amused at your actions, secure in her position of experience.  But after a short while of you putting forth your suspiciously practiced best efforts, you realize Julie begins to mirror your enthusiasm.  Whether she was threatened or turned on, you cannot say.

“What are you doing!?” you squeak when Julie suddenly attacks you.  She works her hand into your underwear.

“Hehe!  You are soaked, Taylor.  It is clear you //really// need some cock!”

Julie’s invasion of you personal space makes you react impulsively.  You mirror Julie’s actions.  Your hand is suddenly covered by wetness and engulfed by your sister’s heat.

“Holy shit, you’re overflowing down here too!” you blurt out before realizing a disgusting truth.  //Eww… I am touching Julie’s pussy… my sister’s really hot... wet… pussy.//

“Ahhh!” you yell as Julie ups her game, she begins to pull down your pants.  You respond in kind. And soon you are both bottomless, [[with Ryan’s huge cock towering above you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1387" name="with Ryan’s huge cock towering above you." tags="" position="11990,25008" size="100,100">You copy Julie’s actions and take half of Ryan’s cock to focus on.  With two women servicing him, Ryan’s penis is covered in sensual kisses, far more contact than one mouth alone could offer.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryanjulietay.gif&quot;&gt;
“Holy fuck… Ugh… You girls… are…. //amazing...//”

Julie momentarily abandons Ryan.  She throws away her top.  Your eyes flit past your sister’s bare chest.  For an instant you have a desire to stare at Julie’s perfectly shaped chest but you are distracted by Ryan’s penis that has gradually filled your field of view.

[[Your sister and Ryan work together to strip you naked.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1388" name="Your sister and Ryan work together to strip you naked." tags="" position="12138,25102" size="100,100">Your partners follow suit as well.   Soon everyone is naked.  You lose track of all the hands...

“Mmmmmm!”

“Wow, Taylor, you might have some talent as a cock-sucker,” Julie teases you.

You taste pre-cum.  Your senses are dominated by dick and Julie’s instructions.

//This is so wrong.  I am on my knees… sucking a dick… with Julie… Agghhh...//  You bury your internal dilemmas and focus strictly on the task at hand.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ryanjulietay2.gif&quot;&gt;
Ryan flounders under the combined assault of the Roux beauties.  With a loud groan, he ejaculates all over your waiting faces, dividing his huge load fifty-fifty.

“Whoa… ahhh… there is so much cum,” you pant right before Julie kisses you.  “MMmphggah!” you push her back and cough, suddenly conscious of all the cum Julie has just deposited in your mouth.

“That is what a real man tastes like, Taylor,” Julie concludes.  “Let’s go upstairs.  My room.  Taylor’s is dirty…”

You can do nothing but follow Ryan and Julie upstairs, conscious of a warm, wet trail dripping its way down your thighs.

Once inside, Ryan takes out a condom but Julie shakes her head.  “I want Taylor’s first time to be //authentic.//”

Ryan looks to you.  “Is that okay?”

[[“...”]]
[[“No.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1389" name="“...”" tags="" position="11995,25204" size="100,100">“See, look at that.  She’s like a blushing bride.  Ryan, just give her what she wants!” Julie whispers to Ryan.

Julie and Ryan bear down upon you.  They push you down onto the bed. Ryan takes his place in front of you.

You open your legs while your sister’s hands guide Ryan inside you.

“Julie-Ryan-wai--Ahh….”  Ryan’s cock fills the void inside you.  “Agghhhhhhhhh…..”

“There you go, Taylor!  Virginity over!  Now let’s get away from pain and into //pleasure!//”

Ryan’s huge dick begins to slowly withdraw before plunging back in, establishing a nice steady rhythm.

“Ahh… Ryan’s dick is inside me….”   //Again...//  “Hnngg…”  //Fuck, this feels so damned good!//

Ryan proceeds to fuck you with long, steady strokes.  Just as you are about to cum, Julie appears at your side. 

“J-Julie?!”  Your sister wastes no time in joining the fray.  She begins to tease your nipples, [[the combined pleasure soon drives you over the edge.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1390" name="“No.”" tags="" position="12293,25164" size="100,100">

I am cumming!” you wail as your body is rocked by an incredibly intense orgasm, leaving your skin tingling and your head spinning.

The next thing you know, you are lost in a sea of pleasure which only deepens as Julie begins to play with your clitoris.  The clitoral stimulation coupled with the movements of Ryan’s cock sends you into the throes of passion.

Your sister and Ryan eagerly indulge you.  You cum five or six times until you feel light headed and thirsty.  But wicked Julie and her boyfriend give you no respite.

With Julie’s help, you are repositioned on the edge of the bed.  Ryan’s penis pierces deep inside you a second later.  

You grab your ankles and bob back and forth in time with Ryan’s thrusts.  He penetrates you to your deepest recesses and you lose yourself in the feeling of his manly flesh claiming you and making you utterly his.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/ballsdeep.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”  Ryan’s thrusts catapult you through your orgasmic finish line.  Cock convulsing, he thrusts balls deep inside you and fills you with copious amounts of semen until your vision and insides are pure white..

Swept down into a whirlpool of confusion and pleasure.  “Ahh…. semen… wha...aghh…” you mumble in an incoherent daze.

“You love cock, don’t you, Taylor?” Julie teases you.  You nod, head lolling forward [[before sprawling backwards on the bed.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1392" name="before sprawling backwards on the bed." tags="" position="11995,25356" size="100,100">“Alright!  Now that Taylor has been shown the light, I am ready for my turn!” Julie purrs to Ryan.

“Ugh.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh yeah baby!”  You are vaguely conscious of the sounds of sex, and Julie’s figure riding Ryan.

Just as you come to your senses, Julie passes out next to you, a mixture of Ryan’s cum and her own leaking down her thigh.

Ryan appears sweaty and exhausted but when your eyes meet, Ryan’s indomitable manhood rises to life again.

Long after Julie passes out, you and Ryan continue your coitus with your sister sleeping soundly next to you.  You fuck late into the night, doing your best to milk Ryan’s balls dry.  You orgasm repeatedly, clamping down on Ryan’s dick with your feminine folds until your flesh is so sensitive that you are no longer able to continue.

&quot;I can&#39;t deny that…&quot;  You glance up at a clock mounted on the wall.  &quot;It is getting late.  I should be going.&quot;

&quot;Oh I agree!&quot;

The photographer nervously licks his cracked lips.  &quot;How about we do a tasteful naked shot?  That would shut up all your critics.  We can show them all!&quot;

&quot;N-naked shot!?&quot;  //That would definitely show them all!//  &quot;I can&#39;t do that!&quot;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1404" name="all the other guests had passed out." tags="" position="2443,20844" size="200,200">The next afternoon, you wake up entangled in Evan’s arms.
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
You look around Evan’s room with blurry eyes.  “That was a late night.”

“A great night,” Evan murmurs sleepily from beside you.

You close your eyes, content to sleep until your body wakes comfortably.

A couple of hours later, you cook breakfast in the evening.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/baconeggs.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;

“Taylor!  We need to// talk//.”  Evan’s seriousness and intensity catches you off guard.

“Uh… okay.”  [[You follow him back upstairs into his room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1405" name="You follow him back upstairs into his room." tags="" position="2695,20993" size="100,100">Evan seems a bit nervous although his face is completely neutral with no trace of his ever-present smile.  Evan takes a deep breath.  “We have been spending a lot of time together…” he begins.

You laugh.  “That’s an understatement.”

“And… //it isn’t enough!//” Evan shouts.

“Huh?  What the hell are you talking about?”

“Taylor… I want to, no, I //need// to see more of you.”

“We already hang out nearly every day.  I am not really sure what you are trying to-”

“Please go out on a date with me,” Evan suddenly requests.

“What!?”

“Why are you so surprised?  We are already practically dating!”

“What?  We are!?”

“Well, we have sex,” Evan points out.  [[“A lot.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1406" name="“A lot.”" tags="" position="2553,21080" size="100,100">You feel yourself blush furiously.  “So!?”

“Well we have sex, we hang out a lot, we look out for each other //and// we like each other’s company,” Evan continues.

“So what?”  You sound shrill.

“That is pretty much the definition of dating,” Evan concludes.  //Hmmm…uh oh.//  As you think about Evan’s words for a moment, you realize that he is correct.

“That doesn’t mean we need to make this weird! I am a guy!  A week from now I could be back to the way I was!” you protest.

Evan goes silent for a time.  //If he tells me I might be stuck like this forever I am going to murder him,// you quietly fume.

Instead Evan takes a different angle.  His words shock you.  “I hope it happens, Taylor.  I want you to be happy!” your friend declares.  Evan seems to be speaking from the heart which tugs at your own.

[[You have no idea what to say to that.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1407" name="You have no idea what to say to that." tags="" position="2697,21134" size="100,100">“But… I want to be happy too.  And when I am with you… I am and more,” Evan confesses.

“Evan, I--”

“It’s okay, I know what you are going to say.  We don’t have to give up the search… all I am saying is we should enjoy the potentially limited time we have left together.  You should take some time to smell the roses while there are still flowers in the field.”

“So you want to date… temporarily.  //Two fucking men//….fucking?”

“You know I don’t look at you that way.  The only person who sees a guy when they look at you...is limited to just you.  To me, you’re one hundred percent female.  There isn’t really anything manly about you right now except for your attitude and potty mouth.”

//You just contradicted yourself a sentence later… fuck...//  “Taylor Roux...dating...a guy….”  The idea seems awful.  But, if you really think about your relationship with Evan, is it actually that different from a regular heterosexual relationship?  //My circumstances aside...probably not..//  “Go on a date with Evan…. Be Evan’s //girlfriend.//  Yuck.”  [[Even the words sound crazy exiting your mouth.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1408" name="Even the words sound crazy exiting your mouth." tags="" position="2549,21228" size="100,100">“Please Taylor!  We have already helped each other out.  How many times have we laughed together?  How many times have we //orgasmed// together?  Please be my girlfriend.  Even if it is just temporary.  Just once I want to be able to say I have a girlfriend like you.”

“Like me?”

“My dream girl.  My goddess.”

“STOP!  We are not having this conversation again!”  You sigh in exasperation and Evan’s eye’s light up.

“So you have thought about it!”

 “That doesn’t mean it is a good idea.  I admit you have helped...uh, //distract// me lately but maybe that is all this has been.  I need to get away from pleasant distractions and focus on reclaiming my life.”

“Why reclaim your old, shitty life when you now have a better one?  When I look at you I see the most impressive woman in the world.  You’re way hotter than Julie!  We already have all the same interests and hobbies; we already get along great!  You and I are a //perfect// match,” Evan asserts.  “Look at how awesome the past few weeks have been!  This could be our life! Our relationship is actually something meaningful, admit it.  We care for each other.  We satisfy each other.  We are great together.  You should be my girlfriend,” Evan delivers his pitch, his sudden confession, like a high priced lawyers grand slam. 

//A life with Evan…?  As his ...girlfriend?  Ahh…..AHHHH!!!//

You feel a hot torrent of confusion descend upon you.  You have never felt more confused or conflicted before in your life.  You feel like you are moments away from a brain aneurysm.

You are shocked by Evan&#39;s words.  Your jaw drops.  Even you, Taylor “Fucking” Roux, cannot even bear to cuss.  You are rendered utterly speechless as the butterflies in your stomach surge forth and threaten to rip apart your insides.  You are suddenly only aware of Evan’s dopey grin and your own thundering heart.  

You know you are at a tipping point now.

He seems to be waiting for an immediate answer.  Evan is a spontaneous guy after all…

[[Agree to be Evan’s girlfriend… temporarily.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1409" name="Agree to be Evan’s girlfriend… temporarily." tags="" position="2694,21286" size="100,100">You know it is a bad idea to make an already weird situation even stranger…  //Evan’s girlfriend...//  The thought is not as revolting as you would have once imagined.  //We already jumped off the deep end…  We kiss.  We fuck.  We spend most of our time together… God damnit, how in the hell did things end up like this?//  You realize that, deep down, you want your relationship to continue… or even worse, //progress.//  //We are running out of time here!  That’s right… this is only temporary!  … I hope...//  You look into Evan’s eyes and feel your heartbeat quicken.  //I will find a way a to change back!  But I want to have some fun along the way too.  it would be a shame to waste this chance… this //feeling.

“I will be your... “  You pause, it takes a huge amount of willpower to claw out the remaining words and finish your sentence.  “...be your girlfriend.”

Evan grins like a maniac who just won the lottery.

“But only temporarily!” you add.

Evan is unperturbed.  He laughs outright.  “Everything in life is temporary.  Come here, Taylor… I want to kiss you so badly…”

You and Sandra head outside and hop into her car.

&quot;Where to?&quot; Sandra asks you once inside.

&quot;Just anywhere near the south end of campus is fine.&quot;

&quot;Oh, do you live in the dorms?&quot; Sandra asks you as you hit the road.

You enjoy an uneventful walk home.  The cool night air refreshes you and makes you forget about your strange evening with Craig.  Although your feet become a tad sore, you make it home without incident.

A few days go by when you find yourself eyeing your stack of recently earned cash.

//Craig might be a bit perverted but as long as I keep control of the situation I should be able to make some serious easy money...//

Money has a powerful allure, regardless of your circumstances.  //It might even make it easier to investigate my condition if I could hire an investigator or something.//

Sandra gives you a sly smile.  &quot;So, Tammy, do you have a boyfriend?&quot;

You feel your face heat up.  &quot;Um, no.&quot;

You find the small talk to be a tad embarrassing but you indulge Sandra.  You speak briefly about your fake ambitions to become a nurse.

&quot;So, I take it Craig was well behaved?&quot; Sandra asks you.

You are unsure how to answer.

What do you mean?”  You hold up a small lock of your hair and do a double take.  Your hair has always been a neutral brown - at night it often appeared dark while under direct light, perhaps it did have a bit of a reddish tone...but now that tone has been magnified considerably.  Your hair is still brown but it has moved far beyond a hint of chestnut into something approaching what many people would call a “redhead.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lockofhair.jpg&quot;&gt;
“What the fuck?  That is so weird...”

“Do you feel okay?” Evan asks you.

You suppress your anxiety.  “Yes, peachy.”

As Evan drives, you notice him breathing heavily through his nose.  It starts softly at first but soon he is audibly inhaling, like he is sniffing a flower instead of the stale car air.

“Are //you// okay?” you ask your friend.  “Do you want me to open a window?”

“No!  L-leave it.”  Evan takes another deep breath.  “Being in this small of a space is hard with you.”

“Hard?  Oh…” your eyes fall on your friend’s boner.

“Can you help me out?” Evan requests.

“We just had a weekend of sex and you want...more sex?  [[Get a hold of yourself man!”]]

The rest of the trip finishes uneventfully, lost in a blur of dark rolling hills.

Once back in the city, Evan drops you off.  He helps you carry your gear inside.

You awkwardly thank him for the ride and he departs.

Once alone, you instantly feel anxious.

“What the hell have I done?” you ask yourself.  Your relationship with Evan has progressed to a new pinnacle of weirdness.  You recall kissing Evan and shiver, as disgust, shame, and arousal battle for control of your emotions.

All your “physical activity” during the weekend has left you sore and exhausted.

&quot;Sure, no problem,&quot; you interrupt Sandra&#39;s sale pitch.

Sandra is amazed.  &quot;Really!?  You are the best!  How soon can you get here?&quot;

&quot;I will head over right now.&quot;

&quot;Do you want some?&quot; Craig offers.

You are a bit thirsty.  &quot;Sure, pour me a glass please.&quot;

&quot;Y-you just need to find Weirdo!  He hides and we seek - //but in a book!//&quot; Craig adds with awed emphasis.

&quot;That is … really cool.&quot;

&quot;Tammy, do you want to play?&quot;

&quot;Sure, I guess.&quot;

Your ward grins.  [[&quot;Let&#39;s have a wager!&quot;]] Craig suggests.

Craig&#39;s face falls with exaggerated disappointment.  &quot;Oh, it&#39;s okay...  My dad says wagers are only for people with pride who are confident in their skills and intelligence.&quot;

Craig&#39;s words are more than a slap across the face.

&quot;Hey- I am- …. Uh, someone who doesn&#39;t give up!&quot;  //I almost said Taylor Roux!//

Craig shrugs, seemingly doubtful of your resolve.  He then shoots you a particularly insufferable smirk.

You grit your teeth.  //This fucking arrogant kid!//  You want to wipe the silly look off his face.  //I shouldn&#39;t let this guy manipulate me but god damn it that attitude pisses me off!  There is no way I can lose to this twerp again!//

[[&quot;Fine, you&#39;re on.  I will find this weird guy way before you!&quot;]]

Craig nods thoughtfully.  He then rushes over to the corner of his room and digs through a box on a shelf.

&quot;This one is new!  See?  It is in the package still!&quot;

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s do this!&quot;

Craig opens up the book and your eyes immediately strain to take in the complex scene.  It becomes abundantly clear that unless you focus your efforts your chance of victory is not particularly high.

Eventually, you become a bit bored.  &quot;Maybe we should watch a movie…&quot;

&quot;Tammy!&quot; Craig interrupts you.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I know something way better than a movie!&quot;

&quot;And what would that be?&quot;  //If I suggests something perverted I am going to smack him.//

You see a distorted yet familiar figure through the shower&#39;s curtain.

&quot;Craig!  Why are you in here!?&quot;  You are more than alarmed because you //definitely// locked the door before stripping.

Craig seems confused by your question.  &quot;I wanted to see you naked!&quot;

&quot;Get out!  I need privacy!&quot;

&quot;Fine!&quot;  Craig then grabs your clothes and all the towels in the bathroom before running off.

&quot;You little stinker!  Get back here!&quot; you scream as you step out of the shower, nearly slipping in the process.

You freeze in the threshold of the bathroom door.  //Fuck!  I am naked!  What the hell am I going to do!?//  You only seem to have two options and they both suck.

You begin to sweat profusely.  &quot;Heh… Uh, one more?&quot;

&quot;Fine, whatever.  You win but all you get is the satisfaction of victory.&quot;

&quot;Nuh uh!  We never agreed on the terms, so the ones from last time are still in effect,&quot; Craig argues.

Craig stares at you in disbelief.

&quot;So what do I get for my reward?&quot;

Craig glances around nervously.  &quot;How about some good juice?&quot;

&quot;How about you read a book with //words// instead of //pictures?//&quot; you suggest with a wicked smile.

His response emboldens you. You follow after him with balled fists and trembling rage. 

For a chubby guy, Craig&#39;s speed surprises you. He manages to get into his room and nearly closes the door before you push forward and wedge yourself into the crack.

“Well… um, should we //consummate// our new relationship?” Evan suggests.

“This new relationship is suspiciously a lot like the old one…” you dryly note.  You find it hard to deny Evan’s lust.. Or your own similar desires.

You and Evan stand but continue to make out, very slowly migrating to the hallway.

“Where are you leading me?” you ask Evan with a giggle.

Evan blushes.  “I am trying to lead you to the condom stash in the bathroom,” he admits.

You laugh at his honesty and let Evan draw you into the bathroom.

Evan fumbles with a condom.

“Holy shit!” you yelp as Evan’s girth fills you up.  Your tiny body is barely capable of accepting Evan&#39;s penis.

“You’re even tighter than usual!” Evan opines as he screws your brains out.

You ride Evan like a mad woman, slamming him up against the back of the bathtub.  You take complete control.  As you hump him faster and faster, you finally trigger a fantastic orgasm.  As the pleasure overflows from within you, you cannot help but to intensify your motions.  Your lips brush up against Evan’s and that forms an additional catalyst.  

“Unnnghh!  Mmmmphmmm….” You moan as you yearn for more, rocking your hips faster.  Your mouth locks with Evan, combining into a passionate kiss.  You fuck Evan hard, trying to force as much dick and tongue into your body as possible.  Just when you feel a familiar pressure near capacity, Evan extends a wet finger to your asshole.  The extra stimulation is the coup de grace, and you lose yourself in another record orgasm.

“You love having you ass played with, don’t you?” Evan whispers in your ear.  “Maybe we should find that tail again…”

“Shut up and fuck me, Evan,” you reply.

“Taylor, I will do anything you want… but especially that!”

Evan obliges you long into the night.

“Well there you go,” your sister concludes.  “This is just going to help you look good - and believe me when you //look// good, you //feel// good.”

Your sister dusts you with random pads and brushes and you stoically endure.
That is, until your sister holds up a mascara stick.

“No,” you say preemptively.

“Yes,” she “corrects” you, overwriting your reply with a stern look and a grimace.

You have a brief staring contest but you find that you are the first to look away.  You try and stay absolutely still as the strange object works its way around your eyes.

Next, your sister holds up a stick of ruby-red lipstick.

“You have got to be kidding me!”

“Taylor!  We have already come this far.  Just let me finish.  It will be worth it, trust me,” she assures you.  Her words don’t make you feel any better.

Your sister steps away, revealing your reflection.  You blink in momentary confusion at the mirror.  Your lips are red and glistening.  Your cheeks have an extra brushing of colour, your eyes pop and stand out so much you end up staring directly at yourself in disbelief.

Julie laughs at your expression.  “I know right?  You look super hot!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/makeup.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
It was undeniably true, you looked exactly like the kind of woman you would have once died to sleep with.  The appraisal makes you deeply uncomfortable.

“Hey Evan, what’s up?”

“Not much… How are you feeling?”

“Hmm, not too bad…  Concerned about me?” you tease Evan.

“Well, with what happened to you…” Evan trails off.

“Yeah, I guess it is amazing I am even alive.  I still feel fine, well, //weird// but physically fine.”

“Since you’re alright, how about some fresh air?” Evan suggests.

“Sure, that might be nice.  What do you have in mind?”

“Well, the truth is, that I am meeting up with some buds in a couple hours at the Riker Field.  You in for some soccer?”

Your enthusiasm vanishes.  [[“Some buds?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1472" name="“Some buds?”" tags="" position="2004,11743" size="100,100">“Yeah, Jerry, Robbie, Jimmy, maybe a few others.  Tim is going to play too and that guy is really good!”

//Those are most of the guys from that party at Jimmy’s...//  After your ultra-embarrassing night, you would prefer to never seen them again… at least not in your current form.

Evan senses your unease.  “Don’t worry about that bullshit the other night.  We were all drunk.  I was probably the most sober person there and I don’t remember shit,” Evan assures you.

“Why do I doubt that?  I think I might have to pass...”

“Oh, don’t be a wuss!”  Evan tries a different angle.  “Being outside would do you some good.”

“I don’t know…  I was never much of an athlete… and now I doubt myself even more,” you explain as you hold out a slender arm that now appears to be devoid of visible muscle.

“Oh come on!  Don’t be that way.  These games are competitive but having fun still comes first.  There are five of us so far, and it would be pretty lame to play with an odd number.  If luck holds maybe Rhea and a few others might show up.  We need you, Taylor!”

“As long as you don’t care if I suck,” you reply.  You then wince.  “Uhhh….”  You are glad Evan cannot see your blushing face when you realize how easily your last sentence could be misinterpreted.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1473" name="Join Evan and his friends for a soccer match" tags="" position="1855,11802" size="100,100">Although you have some lingering doubts about the day’s company, you decide some fresh air and exercise would do you good. 

You change into some shorts and a pair of Julie’s running shoes and then head to Riker Field.

When you arrive you see that the field seems blessedly empty apart from your friends.  //Oh, fuck...//  Your blood runs cold when you recognize several familiar faces from Jimmy’s party.  They eye you with wolfish grins.  //Damnit!  I didn’t think it would be this weird.  I hope they aren&#39;t all hanging around me because they think I am easy…  After that stupid poker game they will never leave me alone!  I shouldn&#39;t be here...//  

You spot Jerry, Robbie, and the lanky Jimmy.  A grinning Evan is present as well as Evan’s handsome roommate, Tim.

//Oh shit!  I am the only girl here…  Or girl-esque person or whatever the fuck I am right now.  God damnit, why did I come out here?  I should just become a shut in!  But I don’t want to be stuck like this…  I want to have fun too.// You chide yourself for the silly thought.

You put on your happiest face.  Jimmy and Evan rush up to you.  You wave at them.  “No Rhea?” you say to Evan.  //I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing...//

Jimmy answers for Evan.  “I asked her but she was busy.  We don’t need &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Rhea&quot; &quot;Rhea desc&quot;&gt;&gt; to have fun though!”

“Ain&#39;t that the truth!  C’mon Taylor you’re on my team!” Evan informs you.

Since you are a latecomer, you don’t object.

Jimmy tosses you a soccer jersey.  

You pull the jersey over your head.  You are surprised that the fabric has a slightly stale smell.  You wonder which of the young men afield was the last to wear it.

//Probably better I don’t know.  I need to focus on the game!//

Your limbs are stiff and you seem to be constantly anxious.  You notice a slight tremor in your right hand, which you do you best to hide from Julie.

“Julie, I am feeling a bit out of sorts.  I am going to go for a walk and get some fresh air.”
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to true&gt;&gt;
Your sister looks worried but lets you go with only a frown and a muttered, “have fun.”

[[You walk to a nearby park and sit in the sunshine while watching a young woman throw a frisbee for her dog.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1476" name="You walk to a nearby park and sit in the sunshine while watching a young woman throw a frisbee for her dog." tags="" position="13588,25505" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/frisbee.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You can’t help but be a bit impressed with the dog’s agility as well as envious of its effortless happiness.  The dog merely lives in the moment.  You bet as long as he has a friend and a ball or frisbee, his tail will be wagging.  You watch the puppy run and bound around the park for a while.  The time lifts your spirits a bit.

You close your eyes and attempt to organize your thoughts.  After a few minutes, a strange looking woman dressed in some kind of goth or punk outfit sits next to you despite there being other seating nearby.  You watch her lean back out of the corner of your eye.  //Why did she sit next to me?//  The woman makes you wary, reminding you vaguely of Mitch.  This young woman clearly emanates an aura that says “fuck off.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/louise2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
The woman yawns and uses the action to move even deeper into your personal space.  “Smoke?” the grinning woman offers you a cigarette.

Your first instinct is to decline but you decide you need a bit of a pick-me-up.  “Uh, yeah, sure.  Thanks!”  You accept, hoping some nicotine will make you feel better for a few minutes at least.

“Tough day?” [[enquires the woman as she holds out a lighter.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1477" name="enquires the woman as she holds out a lighter." tags="" position="13436,25599" size="100,100">You take a long drag on your cigarette and then cough your ass off.  The surprisingly intense nicotine high surges through your body like a dozen electrified coffees.

“Tough year,” you reply when you regain your breath.

The punk chick laughs and comments on your “virgin lungs.”  As she speaks, she brushes away a lock of multicolored hair and you find yourself drawn to the woman&#39;s pale green eyes.  You find it difficult to place her age.

You avoid any mention of virginity like the plague, steering the conversation topics in random directions.  You talk about school and airplanes and buried treasure.  You find it relaxing to have a pointless conversation with no ulterior motives involved.  You make small talk and people watch, commenting on passers by until the sky begins to dim.

The strange woman glances at her phone.  “It is getting late.  I have a few things to do…  Will I see you again?”

“I doubt it.  This girl you see before you will hopefully cease to exist before too long,” you reply.

The woman’s eyes widen in confusion.  “That’s a bit morbid…”  She tosses you her pack of cigarettes.  “You need these more than I do.”  [[The young woman man leaves without the two of you ever exchanging names.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1478" name="The young woman man leaves without the two of you ever exchanging names." tags="" position="13584,25657" size="100,100">Once the sun sets and the area begins to cool off, you leave the park and head home.

You fall into an exhausted slumber without ever once thinking of your urge to get high.

The next day you go to class but find your attention to be lacking.

You leave early and, on a whim, walk back towards the park where you met the weird smoker girl.  You avoid the loud, gaudy strip of dining and shopping near school and head directly into the campus green.  As you walk, you begin to feel clear headed and progressively more rejuvenated.

You find an empty picnic table near a playground.  //Heh, at least no one will think I am a pervert.  Hmm...//  You idly wonder about many odd gender double standards and are reminded of something Evan once said.  &quot;Male teacher touches student; goes to jail as a sex offender.  Female teacher bangs student; gets teacher of the year award.&quot;

You sit down to rest and have a smoke, silently brooding about your shitty, confused life.

“Those will kill you ya know!” advises a familiar deep but distinctly feminine voice.

You look up at the speaker, a young woman with multi colored spiky hair.  The woman is tall and well muscled.  You note tattoos cover a large percentage of her visible body, [[immediately making you curious just what else she has hidden away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1479" name="immediately making you curious just what else she has hidden away." tags="" position="13436,25755" size="100,100">“I don’t care,” you reply.  “Getting cancer would probably improve my life right now.  Besides, these were //your// smokes, remember?”

The woman makes a snorting noise.  “Pfft!  That sounds pretty pathetic.  Let me guess: pretty little girl has some insignificant, bullshit troubles and collapses under the weight of...//nothing.//  Am I fucking right?”

“No, you’re fucking not right!”  You scowl at your visitor.  “My life is genuinely… fucked…”

“Enough to kill yourself?” wonders the newcomer.

“No, I am not going to commit suicide!  Suicide is for selfish pussies!  It is just things have been confusing...and shitty lately.”

“Story of everyone’s life I think.  So what happened to you?  Some asshole man got you down?  Or maybe //the// man?”

[[You recall the numerous times Mitch has taken advantage of you with a shiver.]]

You decide to be honest.  “There are assholes everywhere,” you answer.  “In the end… it is my fault for being so weak.  So… it is just me… I am the man.”  You can’t help but laugh at the absurdity of your own statement 

“You’re a man, eh?”  The woman leans in closely you can smell a musty odor you find difficult to place.  “I often get called manly too,” the woman admits.  “My name is just a bonus.  It probably doesn’t help that I have had more girlfriends than most of the dudes I know!”

“//Girlfriends!?//”  Your high pitch catches both of you off guard.

Your new companion laughs.  “Yep!  Hi, nice to meet ya!  I am Lou--and yeah, I like girls…. girls with a bit of attitude.  Kinda like you.  So what’s your name, cutie?”

The sudden change in the tone and direction of the conversation makes you wary.  “Don’t call me a cutie… that is just ...//weird.//”  You sigh and falter under Lou’s unrelenting green-eyed stare.  “My name is Taylor.  Nice to meet you… Lou?”

“Lou-ise~  But, yeah most of the people around here call me Lou,” explains your new friend.

“That is kind of…”

“//Masculine?//” Lou guesses.

“I was going to say, “cool,”” you joke, “but that works too!” you say with a laugh.

Louise chuckles.  “Oh I think I already like you, Taylor.  Be on your guard, cutie.  I almost always get what I want…”  When Louise viciously eyefucks you from head to toe you have little doubt as to her intentions.  “Well I got a show to play a show in a bit so so I gotta go!  See ya around, Taylor.  Good luck with the crippling depression!” Lou jokingly shouts over her shoulder.

[[A few days later, you find yourself in the same general area where you first met Louise.]]

It soon becomes too intense to ignore.  Your urges gobble up all of your focus until it is all you can think about.

“Fuck… I feel so tired and horny.  And holy shit do I ever want to get high...” you remark as you head outside for some air.

You pass a familiar picnic table and recall your meeting with Louise.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pictable.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Maybe Lou knows a better dealer…  She seems cool…  I would much rather hang out with her than Mitch.”

You finger a crumpled twenty dollar bill in your pocket.  You know going to Mitch’s will result in a familiar ritual.

//Why am I even considering going back there?  What the hell is wrong with me?//  You are clearly addicted, but to what [[you cannot conclusively say]].  //It’s just the drugs…  It has to be the drugs!//

“Oh shit!  It’s //you again.//”

“Mitch is the devil you know.  Plus he is a sure thing.  If you show up, you know you will be feeling great in no time.  Life is short, why not enjoy it, eh?”

“That’s right, it’s //me//, Angel Tay!  Now shut your mouth, you spicy tramp!”  Angel Tay turns to you.  “Taylor, she is lying to you.  You know you will feel even worse afterwards if you keep going to Mitch’s apartment.  Momentary pleasure is not worth dying over!  Don’t do it!  Go see find your new friend.  Consensual intercourse with someone you care for is much more fun than destroying your body!  Go find Louise!  Do it for //love!//” implores Angel Taylor.

“Hallucinations like this are perfectly normal!  I am not crazy,” you assure yourself.  //Fucking wow, I hope I am not becoming schizophrenic or something!//

“Hey Bambi!” Louise greets you.

“//Bambi?//”

“You just have that cute, innocent doe-eyed look to you.  It suits you.”

“I hate it.”

“It’s fuckin’ perfect then!” Louise counters.  It makes you deeply uncomfortable to get such a cute nickname.  As you look at Lou, you realize there is no point fighting it.  “You are late but I knew you would come!” Louise continues, ignoring your irritation.

You are mystified.  “How?  This was kind of spur of the moment...”

“Because I am a fuckin’ lightning rod!  And you, baby, are my next storm.”

“Uhhh… is that from a poem or something?”

“It is from my latest song.  I wrote it about you.  You and I are // naturally attracted//.”

“Wait.  What?  You wrote a song about me!?”  You can’t help but be flattered… and a bit wary.  //We just met and she already wrote a me into a song?  Either Lou is batshit crazy or super creative.//  You appraise Louise’s unblinking green eyes and realize suddenly realize that her copious amounts of eyeliner make her look a bit scary.  /Maybe a bit of both...// you decide.

“Come with me!” Louise says as she grabs your hand.

“Where are we going?”

“On a date!” Louise answers as if it was obvious.

“Huh…?”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/upscale.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You nervously eye the upscale decor and become a tad self conscious about your appearance.  “What are we doing here?  I can’t afford this…” you whisper to an unconcerned Louise.  //And I don’t think Louise can either…// you think as you glance at the numerous holes in Louise’s clothing.  //But maybe that is just her style, I think some people actually pay for pre-ripped jeans...//  You seriously doubt Louise is one of those.

“Don’t worry.  It will be// free//,” Louise informs you with a mercurial smile.  You look into Louise’s sparkling green eyes and feel anxious.  //She definitely has mischief in mind...//

“I am //not// dining and dashing!  That is just //wrong//…” you object.

Louise rolls her eyes.  “We are not dining and dashing.  Geez.  [[Who do you think I am?]]”

“For two, please!” Louise answers the hostess’ enquiring glance.

You and Louise sit down at a secluded little booth in the corner of the restaurant.  You bet you are placed there because you are both significantly under dressed.  Luckily, they intend to serve you.

“I didn’t mean to imply anything…” you say to Louise.  “I am sorry.”

Louise laughs.  “Oh I get it all the time.  Bad looking girl with tats just //has to be// bad, right?”

“I prefer to call a spade, a spade.”

“That only works… most of the time.  There are exceptions to the rules.”

“It is hard to judge a book by its cover,” you sagely allow.

“Hah.  You sound naive.  Everyone knows that sex sells.  The truth is what’s on the cover matters.  A lot.  People are superficial as fuck.”

“That’s true…”

[[“But not all of us are, right Bambi?”]]

“Hah!  I am just being honest.  If you were ugly we probably wouldn’t be having dinner right now.  I think that cuts both ways though, am I right?”

“So you’re shallow?”

“Only when it comes to picking out cuties.  And, of course, I take advantage of my position to make a bit of money now and then.”

“Your position?”

“As a hot babe with attitude and a velvet voice, I rule the fuckin’ stage.”

“You’re a singer too?”

“Don’t act so surprised!  It goes with the guitar.”

“Are you like… famous?”

Louise shrugs.  

“Sorry about that, ladies!” your server greets you, derailing the conversation.  The perky young woman is all smiles.  “Can I start ya’ll with a drink?”

“Yeah, we’ll have two Long Island iced teas,” [[Louise orders for you and the waitress leaves.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1489" name="Louise orders for you and the waitress leaves." tags="" position="13444,26555" size="100,100">“Don’t those have a shitload of alcohol?” you wonder.

“Yep.  What do you want for dinner?” Louise changes the subject.

“I don’t know…  This pasta looks kind of good…”  //And inexpensive...//

“Don’t get fuckin’ pasta!  I told you it is //free//.  Order a freakin’ lobster stuffed tiger steak or whatever ya want.”

Despite Louise’s assurances you can’t help but feel a bit uncomfortable.  //Well, I guess if she is a famous singer she probably does get free shit thrown at her…  I bet she knows the manager or something.//

You smile at Louise, resolving to simply enjoy yourself. 

When the waitress returns with your drinks, the two of you order a disgustingly large amount of food.  The waitress leaves your table with a full page note.

“Ooo!  These Long Islands look tasty,” you comment as you reach for a lemon garnishing the edge of the glass.

“Wait!  Don’t drink it.  This is key,” Louise stops you.

“Huh?  [[What the heck are you talking about]]?”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1490" name="What the heck are you talking about" tags="" position="13584,26665" size="100,100">“Just play it cool, okay?” Louise whispers to you.  Louise then sucks on her straw and drains about a fifth of her glass.

Louise’s eyes bulge and turn red.  For a second, you think she is having some kind of allergic reaction.  “Louise, are you okay!?”

“Waitress!” Louise shouts over you.

The waitress rushes over to your table.  “Yes, ladies?”

“Was there fuckin’ alcohol in this!?” Louise demands, gesturing at the Long Island.

The waitress hesitates a moment and then nods timidly.

“Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!” Louise howls, her husky voice reverberating around the restaurant.

“What’s wrong!?  Are you alright!?”

Louise’s face contorts with outrage.  “I have been sober for //nine years!//  Everything is fucking ruined!  I ordered an //iced tea// not a Long Island!  What the hell is wrong with you!?”

“Oh-my-god.  I am so sorry!” the waitress apologizes profusely.

“Not a drop for all that time!  I almost got my ten year chip!&quot; Louise laments, her voice full of sorrow.  &quot;I was so fucking close!  God damnit!  And today is my fucking birthday!  This is the worst day of my life!” Louise sobs, burying her head in her hands.  “We were supposed to //celebrate!//” she wails into the tablecloth which she proceeds to use like  very large hanky.

“I uh… please wait here…  I am going to get my manager right now.”  The mortified waitress scurries off.  

Louise raises her head and wipes away her mock tears.  “See?  Told ya.  Now everything is comped.  [[I do this twice a week or so]],” she nonchalantly adds.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1491" name="I do this twice a week or so" tags="" position="13440,26711" size="100,100">You stare at Louise in disbelief.  “//Dude//…  That’s //awful.//  What about that poor girl?”

“I will leave her a tip, don’t worry.  Sheesh.”

“I don’t know if a tip will make up for that.  She had tears in her eyes!”

“Oh?  That’s great!  Sometimes they just offer a discount.  Tears are a good sign.”

“You’re unbelievable, Louise.”

“Thanks!”

“That wasn’t entirely a compliment….”

A minute later, an incredibly sweaty and apologetic manager appears to beg Louise’s forgiveness.  He comps the entire meal and offers you a free dessert as well.  He even personally takes over as your waiter to make sure everything is satisfactory.

You feel a bit guilty, but decide wasting food is an even greater sin.  You and Louise gorge yourselves, feasting like queens.

Despite the oddness of the evening, you find yourself having a great time.  Louise is funny and surprisingly easy to converse with.  

An hour and a half later, you are outside the restaurant, rubbing your swollen stomach.

Louise offers you a smoke.  “So, Bambi, what did you think about how I paid for dinner?” Lou wonders.

[[“That was pretty cool.”]]
[[“It made me uncomfortable.”]]x</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1492" name="“That was pretty cool.”" tags="" position="13583,26803" size="100,100">“Hahah! That’s the spirit!” crows Louise.

The two of you enjoy a cigarette while staring at the setting sun.

Louise turns to you after flicking her lit cigarette into a nearby garbage can. “Well, Bambi, now that dinner is over, how about we head back to my place and fuck?”

Louise’s shockingly bold request almost makes you think that you misheard.

“Don’t give me that deer-in-the-headlights look, Bambi,” she chides you.

“I…” //This hot chick wants to have sex with me? How do I even have sex like this?// Louise turns you on but you wonder if you possess the equipment necessary to please her. //Ah, what the hell am I thinking!? Louise likes me because I am a girl! If she wants to do it, I’LL DO IT! I will just have to find a way!//

Was there even much distinction between the natural inclinations of a man in woman’s body or desires of a lesbian?

“Taylor, do you think I am hot?” Louise interrupts your trainwreck of thought.

You nod, much to Louise’s satisfaction. Louise is dangerous and sexy, like a poisonous flower. You cannot help but be attracted, even knowing that your actions may lead to your doom.

“Well, I think you’re hot too. So what the hell are we waiting for? C’mon Bambi… Follow me home tonight and [[I promise I will take real good care of you.”]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/soccerg.jpg&quot;&gt;
You run up and down the field sweating your ass off.  The game swings back and forth several times without a point scored.

You luckily intercept a pass but find Robbie right behind you.  You and Robbie battle it out in close quarters.  Robbie has an obvious advantage in strength and speed so you decide that desperate action may be necessary.

[[Try and kick the ball through Robbie’s legs]]
[[Try and distract Robbie with your chest]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1495" name="Try and kick the ball through Robbie’s legs" tags="" position="1856,11942" size="100,100">With a snap kick, you manage to boot the soccer ball right between Robbie’s legs but the ball clips his heel and careens off course.  You then sidestep Robbie, managing to rendezvous with the ball in motion.  

Your opponent is forced to spin around and by that time you are already a few strides ahead.

You decide to go for it.  You give it your all, not giving a damn about your bouncing breasts or appearance, focusing only on scoring.

No one can catch you, although they try.  You manage to slip through the defense.  The goal posts are now in sight.

[[Shoot high]]
[[Shoot low]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1496" name="Try and distract Robbie with your chest" tags="" position="2154,11950" size="100,100">“Hey Robbie!” you pull down your jersey slightly with a hooked finger, revealing your cleavage.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/scleavage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Robbie’s eyes flick upwards from the ball and stops on your chest.  His gaze lingers on your boobs, affording you the extra split second the kick away the ball.  You spot Tim who is open and pass.  Tim then easily scores.  

“Yesssss~!” you cheer.  You give Robbie a smile.  His expression is hard to read.

Evan rushes up to you with a confused and slightly annoyed look on his face.  “Did you just flash Robbie?” he asks you.  

“No, of course not!”

Evan doesn’t answer.  After a moment, his demeanor changes.  You expect some shit talk at the minimum, but instead Evan just keeps sucking in one deep breath after another.  Your old friend seems unable to meet your eyes.

“Wow, Taylor… huuh… huhh… your perfume is fucking strong.  It is like… making me dizzy,” Evan mumbles as he rubs at his red face.

You give Evan a confused look.  “My// what?//  What the hell is wrong with you?  I don’t wear fuckin’ perfume!”

Evan blinks rapidly and then swallows audibly.  [[“Are you... sure?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1497" name="Shoot high" tags="" position="1709,12045" size="100,100">You shoot high and Jerry attempts to block you.  He manages to clip the ball with his head, sending the ball careening off course and causing you to just barely miss the goal post.

“Damn.  Better luck next time!” Jerry shouts as he rubs a fresh bruise on his head.

Evan appears beside you.

“Don’t worry, Taylor!  Next time you got it!  That was … huh… huh… really close…”  Evan trails off while blinking his eyes as if suddenly fatigued.

[[“What the heck is wrong with you?”|You don’t even mind Evan ogling your chest.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1498" name="Shoot low" tags="" position="2007,12052" size="100,100">When the ball touches your feet everything else fades away.

For just an instant, you aren’t a girl or a boy, just merely a person in motion.

You kick the ball with all your might and it shoots forward an inch off the ground, speeding past Jerry’s defense.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/score.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Yeaaaah!  Kick ass!”

“Way to go, Taylor!” your team cheers.  In that instant, you feel like a total badass.

“Yesssss~!” you cheer.  You shoot Evan a triumphant grin.  

Evan rushes up to you with a confused and slightly annoyed look on his face.  “That was awesome!  That went by Jerry like he was standing still!”

Your head swells a bit with the compliment.  [[You don’t even mind Evan ogling your chest.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1499" name="“Are you... sure?”" tags="" position="2057,12244" size="100,100">
“I am positive!”  Evan leans forward and inhales deeply through his nose and you nearly smack him on impulse.  “Did you just //sniff// me!?  What the fuck, Evan!?”  

Evan wipes some sweat from his brow.  “You… can’t smell that?”

“Smell what!?”  You are in an open field of fresh air with a cool breeze blowing through.  You would have to //reek// in order for it to be noticable.  You sniff at your pits in alarm but, aside from the neutral odor of fresh sweat, you cannot detect anything amiss.  “I smell fine!” you insist.

Evan seems to zone out a bit.  “Yeah, you do… he he…” he mumbles in reply  with glazed eyes.  “You are so fine!”

“I don’t wear perfume,” you stubbornly insist as you edge away from creepy Evan.

“Well I did think it was a bit weird…  If I turned into a chick I would just masturbate all day.  Buying perfume would be pretty low on the list--Hey, wait!  Where are you going?” Evan calls after you.

[[You ignore Evan’s stupidity and reposition yourself near the goal away from the other players.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1500" name="You ignore Evan’s stupidity and reposition yourself near the goal away from the other players." tags="" position="1861,12294" size="100,100">You are soon back in the game.

Your modest chest distracts you but you are thankful they are not larger.  You soon become used to the subtle bouncing motion.

//Maybe I should get a sports bra...//

You race up and down the field.  For a few minutes you feel like a kid, irrespective of sex or transformation you are just a player in a fun, athletic game.

Robbie accidently boots the ball far out of bounds.  As he runs after it, [[you notice most of the other players are looking at you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1501" name="you notice most of the other players are looking at you." tags="" position="2013,12392" size="100,100">You begin to feel overly self conscious.  The game resumes but your eerie feeling remains.

The other players are giving you the creeps.  You feel like you are being watched out of the corner of your eye.

Even Tim shoots you a suggestive smile.  //What the fuck is wrong with everyone?  Is this my fault?//  Sure, most of Evan’s friends are weird perverts by default, but you find their oddly forward actions to be unsettling.  //Why are these low level creeps acting so nutty?//

As if on cue, you hear Evan run up behind you.

//Snnniiifff//  “Ew!  What the hell!?”  //This is so inappropriate!// 

“I just wanted to touch your hair…” Evan lamely explains.

“//Why!?//  No wonder you don’t have a girlfriend.  Holy fuck, Evan.”

“What?  I was just checking out your shampoo!”

“That’s the most ridiculous excuse I have ever--”

Your voice cuts off as Evan grabs your hand.  “Taylor, it’s okay.”

You shake off Evan’s hand.  “No, it’s //not// okay!  [[What has gotten into you?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1502" name="What has gotten into you?" tags="" position="1861,12442" size="100,100">An hour passes by in a blink.  You score a couple more goals and have a great time.  Although your sweaty clothes cling to your new curves, you feel reinvigorated.

Now that the game is over, the teams gather in the middle of the field for a final round of shit-talking.

Evan stretches out his arms and grins at you as you join the group.  “See, that was fun, right?” 

“Could have been worse,” you reply.  //I am actually starting to like soccer…//  Sports were never your forte.  Maybe that could change.

“Alright everyone!  Drinks at my place!” Evan announces.

“You got beer?” Jimmy wonders.

“Uhh a few, we will just have to grab some more on the way.”

“That’s fine.  My van is parked not far from here.  I can drive us,” Jerry offers.

Evan and Jimmy look to you.  You decide you don’t have the heart to leave everyone while its still light out.

You follow the group to a nearby parking lot.

[[“Wow, nice ride, Jerry!”]] Evan snickers.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1503" name="“Wow, nice ride, Jerry!”" tags="" position="2001,12544" size="100,100">“Hey, it keeps me mobile and I got room for all you losers!” Jerry comments as he hops in the driver’s seat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/van.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Tim holds the door open for you.  At Jimmy’s beckoning, you hop inside the vehicle.  The inside of the van is uncomfortably warm.

You sit in the middle seat, in between Jimmy and Tim.  Once seated, you feel a bit claustrophobic.  Tim’s leg presses against yours but you stay silent even when the spot where your spot the flesh is touching becomes sweaty.

“It is kind of //stuffy// in here… can you guys open a window?” you ask Jerry.

“No, sorry.  The windows are electric but the motor is burned out.”

//Isn’t there one in each door?//  The excuse doesn’t really make sense to you but you resolve to suffer in silence.

The van soon stops at a nearby liquor store.

“You want us to come in?” Evan wonders.

“Nah, just sit tight.”  Jerry holds out an expectant hand and you each pass him some money.

Five minutes later, you are holding a case of beer.

After your workout and van ride, your desire for a cold beer is nearly all consuming.

//Ah, whatever.  Today was fun.  I will just have a beer or two and bow out before it gets too late,// you assure yourself.

[[You arrive at Evan’s and let Tim carry the case of beer inside.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1504" name="You don’t even mind Evan ogling your chest." tags="" position="1851,12150" size="100,100">“Ev?”

Evan doesn’t answer.  He seems to have spaced out.  After a moment, his demeanor changes.  You expect some shit talk at the minimum, but instead Evan just keeps sucking in one deep breath after another.  Your old friend seems unable to meet your eyes.

“Wow, Taylor… huuh… huhh… your perfume is fucking strong.  It is like… making me dizzy,” Evan mumbles as he rubs at his red face.

You give Evan a confused look.  “My// what?//  What the hell is wrong with you?  I don’t wear fuckin’ perfume!”

Evan blinks rapidly and then swallows audibly.  [[“Are you... sure?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1505" name="You arrive at Evan’s and let Tim carry the case of beer inside." tags="" position="1857,12594" size="100,100">You open a bottle and taste the sweet refreshment.  The cold beer goes down so easily, the first bottle is gone in moments.

“Ahhh, that’s good.”

“Yep.  Beer is the cornerstone of civilization!” agrees Jimmy.

You and the other guys bullshit and drink beer until most of it is gone.

You do a double take when you spot the empty beer box.

Tim launches into a hilarious story involving dead rodents hidden in unsuspecting people’s vehicles.  

“...It was in there for like half a year and he never figured it out.  Then my cousin just kept buying those little pine air freshners… Believe me, it made no difference whatsoever!  I don’t know why the hell he even bothered.  That car was fuckin’ //rank!//” Tim concludes his story much to the delight of the audience.

You laugh and forget about your new body and circumstances, volunteering a childhood story of your own involving Evan and your attempt to build an imitation beaver dam.

“And then just as we are leaving, he slips!  Evan falls right into the shit hole!”  You laugh at your own story until you snort.

Jimmy thoughtfully scratches his wispy beard.  “I didn’t know you and Evan went that far back.”

“Huh?  Oh… Yeah, I have known Evan for ages.  Family friends kind of thing…” you briefly explain.  You set down your beer and rub your sore neck.

Luckily Jimmy doesn’t press for more details.  [[Unfortunately, he sits down behind you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1506" name="Unfortunately, he sits down behind you." tags="" position="2001,12696" size="100,100">“Here, let me help you.  I know just the thing,” Jimmy says as he begins to gently massage your shoulders.  “You have a knot here…” he notes.

“That isn’t a knot, it is my bra stra--”

Jimmy unclips your bra and you feel your boobs drop.

“What the fuck, man!?”

“I am sorry!  It was in the way.”

His hands begin to caress your shoulder blades and press into the sensitive flesh around your shoulder muscles.  

“It feels good, right?”

“Uh… kind of?”  //Maybe that is the issue here…// How do you reconcile a man giving you a feeling of pleasure? 

“Hah, you aren’t very honest.”  Jimmy digs into the flesh behind your scapula.  “See?  You’re very tense,” he notes.  His hands reposition to your collarbone and massages the top of your sore pectoral muscles.

//Ughh… it must be the weight of these damn chest ornaments!//

[[“Wait… Jimmy… Mmm…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1507" name="“Wait… Jimmy… Mmm…”" tags="" position="1857,12738" size="100,100">It feels good to have sore muscles massaged.  Jimmy’s actions remind you of a professional masseuse.  His roaming fingers firmly press into your soft flesh with surprising gentleness.  //Damn, he is really good at this...//

You catch Robbie staring at you from across the room.  You close your eyes in embarrassment.

“Whoa!  I can see her nipples through her shirt!” Robbie loudly proclaims your state of arousal.

Your eyes snap open in alarm.  You look down and are mortified to spot pointy confirmation.  Unless you cross your arms, your nipples would be impossible to hide.

“Okay, Jimmy.  That’s en~ough!” you say as you try and push him away.

Jimmy gives your neck muscles one last firm squeeze and then withdraws his hands.  

For a second you feel relieved until a finger begins to slide down the crack of your bum.

“Eeep!”  You jump up and step away from the others.

//This is bad!// you realize, suddenly cluing in that this night is gradually going down a similar path as your night at Jimmy’s.

You nervously look around the room.  Despite your company usually being loud and boisterous, now they appear quiet and subdued.

You realize everyone is looking at you again.  You are the fixture of attention, and that fact both elates you and makes you deeply uncomfortable at the same time.

[[“Why are you guys looking at me like that?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1508" name="“Why are you guys looking at me like that?”" tags="" position="2005,12844" size="100,100">Robbie answers for the group.

Robbie starts his roundabout pitch with flattery.  “You’re obviously a cool chick, Taylor.  You know how to have fun,” he begins.  “We also know you are willing to strip for poker chips.”

“Hey!  I was drunk!”

“I am not complaining.”

Evan picks up Robbie’s train of thought but tries a softer approach.  “Being around you all day has been hard,” Evan admits.

“I know, right?” Jerry agrees.  I thought I was going to suffocate back in the van there.  In a good way!” he clarifies.

The only one in the room who hasn’t been a monumental creep is Tim.  [[You look to him for support.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1509" name="You look to him for support." tags="" position="1861,12894" size="100,100">You are disturbed to see that even Tim has a very prominent erection.  //Holy fuck!  That dick is huge!//  You mentally slap yourself.  You look away in embarrassment and feel your face flush.

Tim seems to sense your distress but he is not eager to ruin the mood.  “Taylor, I only just met you but it is pretty clear you’re awesome.  Just do what you want!” he advises you off-handedly.  “Go with the flow, have some fun, it’s all good.  Or not.  If you want to “help” us out that’s cool too.  No way any of us here would turn down a babe like you.”

//A babe like me...// you repeat the words and cringe. You feel like you are trapped somewhere in between a nightmare and a very weird wet dream.

Evan begins to rub at his swollen groin.  “Taylor, you’re the only one we can ask…”

“Ask for what?  Wait- you can’t be fucking serious!”  Your objections fall on deaf ears.  “I am not stripping.  And I am definitely not sucking any dicks!  Or whatever the fuck is going through your dirty minds!”

“Whoa, easy there,” Robbie attempts to mollify you.  “We won’t leave you hanging.  We will return the favor.”

“Return the favor?  What do you mea--”  //Oh god!//  [[You panic as the strong arms of your friends push you down and pull your legs apart.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1510" name="You panic as the strong arms of your friends push you down and pull your legs apart." tags="" position="2001,13000" size="100,100">“Why did you come back here with us?  It is obvious you want something to happen!”

“T-that’s not true!”  //They have lost their minds!//

“Guys?  Guys!?  Don’t rape me!” you shout at them.

“Oh stop being so dramatic,” Robbie chides you.  “We aren’t going to rape you.  Unless you want us to!” Robbie quickly adds. 

The men seem overwhelmed with lust.  You are powerless to fight against them.

In an attempt to distance yourself from the moment, you close your eyes just as Robbie’s face presses into your panty clad groin.

“Oh~!”

His nose presses into your crevice.

“See?  I knew it!  This babe is totally soaked.  I told ya she was a slut!” Robbie opines.

You can feel the men’s laser-like focus directed at your vagina.  You feel like you are going to explode into smithereens of embarrassment.  You can feel yourself getting warmer and wetter by the second.

Without further ceremony, [[Robbie pulls your panties aside and begins to eat you out.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1511" name="Robbie pulls your panties aside and begins to eat you out." tags="" position="1861,13050" size="100,100">“Oh my god…”  //I am getting head as a girl!  And it feels… fantastic!//  “Ohh…”  Robbie’s tongue soon has you squirming.

You barely notice when Tim kneels beside you.

You blink.  “Tim!?”

“Hey babe,” he says as a large black hand envelopes your right breast.

“Ahhh…”

Jimmy reclaims his position behind you and resumes his massage.  You can feel his boner pressing into your lower back.  The triple stimulation drives you wild.

Robbie works his tongue inside you while one of his vibrating hands drapes over your clitoris.

Although you try to fight it, your good sense is soon eclipsed by pleasure.

Your trembling legs become weak.  Your crotch feels warm and soupy

You orgasm so hard your eyes roll back in your head as you go nuts bucking and grinding your vagina into Robbie’s face.

//I can’t believe these guys made me cum…  Ahhh…  A woman’s orgasm is the best!//

“Haah… Huahh.. Hah…” you pant.  You blink your glazed eyes, [[suddenly frightened about what comes next.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1512" name="suddenly frightened about what comes next." tags="" position="2005,13148" size="100,100">Your eyes catch Evan’s.

Evan looks confused, but you note that he doesn’t look away.  It is obvious he wants to see you naked as badly as the others but you suspect that he is wary due to your friendship.  Evan seems horribly conflicted.  Yet in a battle of vices, Evan soon capitulates to lust.

“I am sorry, Taylor…”

“Are you guys seriously this perverted?” you wonder in disbelief.

The men in the room exchange glances.  “Yes, yes we are,” Robbie answers without missing a beat.  “We got like this because of you.  You are hot as fuck.  If you want to bless our miserable existences with some boobs, well that would be awesome, but it is your prerogative.”

Your swimming vision falls on Evan’s erection.  “Eww…  You too, Evan?!”

The arousal in the room is palpable.  Everyone is breathing heavily, including yourself.

“Don’t you losers know any other girls!?”

“That look like you?  No.”

Jerry nods.  “My last girlfriend was a cow.”

Jimmy shrugs.  &quot;Rhea isn&#39;t here.&quot;

//Maybe I am the crazy one.  Why am I still in this house with these guys!?  I need to get out of here before it is too late!  But why can&#39;t I move?//

With your heart racing and an orgasm&#39;s warmth lingering in your veins, you decide to:
[[“Help out” the losers]]
[[Get the fuck out before things get even weirder.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1513" name="“Help out” the losers" tags="" position="1862,13194" size="100,100">You sigh as you cave into lust.  An undulating tingle spreads through your body.  Although you can’t imagine being so bold and pervy, you can still directly relate to the frustrations of the young men around you.  If you can make their month, or year just by showing off some globes of fat, then that seems like an easy ask.  //Or it would be if I didn’t have so much self respect.  Fuck me...//  

As your eyes dart around the room, you realize getting fucked is a real possibility.  //With five guys here I cannot let that happen!  I am not just “one of the guys” anymore!//

As the men stare at you with unblinking eyes, you pull off your shirt and drop your bra, [[baring your perky breasts for your friends to inspect.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1514" name="Get the fuck out before things get even weirder." tags="" position="2152,13194" size="100,100">Safe route?

The cocktail of pleasure, alcohol, and attention has made your state of mind malleable.

You hear five rapid intakes of breath as your shirt hits the ground.  The room becomes so silent you could hear a pin drop.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytoplessfriends.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Fuck, I am not even that drunk… What’s my excuse now!?//  Your actions go far beyond generosity or common sense.

“Wow!  Taylor, your boobs are //amazing!//” Evan says after a moment.

Jerry nods his head enthusiastically in agreement.

“I bet they feel soft,” imagines Robbie.

Jimmy cups your breasts.  “Yep,” he confirms.  “You have no idea, man.”

“Yeah, top notch,” Tim agrees.

“Hey!  No touching!” you protest.

“Where’s the fun in that?”

“Oh, I wanna feel too!” Evan says as he lurches forward.

You are assailed by a wall of grasping hands.

[[“Aaaaaaaaiiighhhhhhhhh!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1516" name="“Aaaaaaaaiiighhhhhhhhh!”" tags="" position="1858,13338" size="100,100">For a moment you are reminded of a dog breastfeeding puppies.  Your friends jostle for position, pushing each other out of the way for better access to your body.  They roughly grope your sensitive breasts and flesh.  //Ahhh….  This is like masturbation on steroids!//  You had explored your new body but you only have two hands.  This experience is unlike anything you tried solo.

As five pairs of hands roam over your body, you feel yourself heating up.  Although you try and squirm away while closing your legs, you are surrounded by strong men.  Robbie returns his hands to your wet vagina.

“Guys…  Uh…. Mmm….  Oh!”  Robbie’s fingers slide inside you as he begins to viciously finger fuck you.

//Schlick, shclick, schlick...//  Lewd sounds echo throughout the room.  Robbie begins to accelerate the pace of his movements just as Jimmy’s fingers begin to tease your nipples.

//I can’t do this…  I am going to go nuts!//  Your body feels like it has been lit on fire.

“Hnnngggahhhhhhh!” your moans echo throughout the house as you fall off the precipice into a sea of pleasure.  You cum hard and flop around in your friend’s arms.

In the aftermath of your orgasm your damp skin tingles.  [[You can feel fluid dripping from your pussy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1517" name="You can feel fluid dripping from your pussy." tags="" position="2006,13444" size="100,100">You cannot help but inspect yourself.  Your hand comes back slick with secretions.  You are far from the only to notice this.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taypussyshow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“She is ready now!” Robbie announces to the group.

You hear a metallic clink and turn in time to see Robbie lower his fly, revealing his large erect cock.

You are flabbergasted.  “Don’t just whip out your dick!”

“I thought the mood called for it.”

Your eyes focus on Robbie’s erection.  For some reason, you cannot look away.

//Ew!  Why am I looking at this thing!?  I am not interested in guys!//

Yet you are naked and dripping in front of //five// of them.  //This is fucked up!  I don’t want this soccer game to degenerate into a damned orgy!//  Especially not with you as the centerpiece.

As you wage your internal debate, Robbie kneels in front of your open legs.  His large cock lines up with your own genitals.  You are suddenly terrified.

“Puss or mouth?” Robbie offers you two awful choices.

[[“... I will use my mouth.”]]
[[Try and buy some time.]]
[[Stay silent.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1518" name="“... I will use my mouth.”" tags="" position="1753,13545" size="100,100">You have another momentary lapse of judgement.

“... I will use my mouth,” you answer.  You can scarce believe the words that leave your lips.  You immediately regret your decision to go along with this but the moment to back out has passed.  You have just humiliated yourself in front of your peers.  //But I said it… Damnit!  Anything is better than having sex with these idiots!//  You imagine Evan fucking you and nearly vomit on impulse.  //Anything but that...//

“Great choice!  I want those sweet lips around my cock!” Robbie informs you.

You stay motionless but the other men do not.  Tim begins to rub your labia while Jimmy plays jazz flute on your chest.  You feel the distracting pressure build inside you until it is all you can think about.

When you open your mouth to moan, Robbie thrusts his dick forward, [[impaling your face with his manhood.]]
&lt;&lt;set $grouppath1mouth to true&gt;&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1519" name="Stay silent." tags="" position="1901,13642" size="100,100">You can’t utter such embarrassing words.  Despite your internal screams, you stay silent.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/robbieprep.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Robbie takes your silence as assent.  He begins to press his glans into your most intimate spot.

//Oh god, no!  This feels so fucking weird!  Why in the hell did I let this happen!?//  

“Don’t worry.  This will feel great.  I promise,” Robbie assures you.  He then begins to push his dick into your feminine folds.  “Holy fuck she is tight!” he comments [[as the rest of your friends watch him penetrate you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1520" name="as the rest of your friends watch him penetrate you." tags="" position="2002,13800" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/robbie2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Just like that, the instant passes in a flash of confusion and pain.  //I just lost my virginity… I am having sex with a man!  With Robbie!//  Not even a quantum supercomputer could have predicted this!

The situation is so bizarre and surreal that you can do little except endure while Robbie bangs you like a stallion.  You stare in amazement as your tiny cunt repeatedly accepts Robbie’s girthy cock, sliding in until Robbie’s balls are pressed against your ass cheeks.

It hurts but those feelings are dwarfed by the oddly fulfilling sensation of having a penis inside you.  Robbie fucks you for what feels like hours.  The sounds and smells of sex fill the room.

You soon feel half delirious from the experience.  Just when you think things cannot get any weirder, Tim and Jimmy thrust their cocks into view.

You stare in shock at Tim’s big black cock.  //Holy shit!  That is the biggest dick I have ever seen!//

To your surprise, your mouth begins to water.

Tim guides your hand to his cock.  You run your fingers down his veiny shaft while marvelling at its size and hardness.

[[Tim moves slowly his cock towards your mouth.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1521" name="Tim moves slowly his cock towards your mouth." tags="" position="1855,13852" size="100,100">“Taylor, please suck on my dick,” Tim politely requests.

You are past the point of giving a fuck.  Whether it was Tim’s politeness or the last vestiges of your sanity fleeing your mind, you lower your face and wrap your lips around Tim’s glans.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timpartysuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Once you never would have considered having sex with a man.  Now you are surrounded by them and you have two penises inside you at the same time.

[[You proceed to awkwardly give Tim a blow job.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1522" name="your mind gradually goes blank." tags="" position="1857,14004" size="100,100">“I am cumming too!” Robbie announces, withdrawing his dick from your pussy with a soft //plop.//

The next instant Robbie blows his load all over your stomach.  His hot seed pools in your belly button while Tim’s drips down your face.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/fpovcumtum2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The distance of the ejaculation surprises you.  You imagine that happening inside you and shiver with equal parts anticipation and fear.

“I am next!” Evan calls dibs.  

Evan’s cavalier attitude annoys you immensely.

“Evan… you too?  Seriously?”

“The cock wants what the cock wants,” Evan replies.  “And right now I want to put this deep inside you.”

“Ughh…  Please don’t say shit like that!”

“Me too!  Jerry and I are dying here!” remarks Jimmy.

[[Evan mounts you while Jimmy and Jerry thrust their dicks forward for you to service.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1523" name="Evan mounts you while Jimmy and Jerry thrust their dicks forward for you to service." tags="" position="2005,14098" size="100,100">Seeing no way out but compliance, you begin to jerk off the Js.

“Grrr!  I can’t believe Robbie got to you first!” Evan fumes as he slides inside you with one ponderous stroke.  

“Unnnnghh…” you moan as the fresh cock spreads you apart.  You can feel your internal muscles gripping Evan.  Evan’s dick fills you to capacity.

Evan seems lost in his own world.  “Oh my god!   Your pussy is the best, Taylor!”

It is impossible to deny your own pleasure… or slow the progression of this [[awful and awesome night.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1524" name="Try and buy some time." tags="" position="2211,13490" size="100,100">“I need to use the washroom!” you say a bit too loudly.  You struggle to stand and then scamper off.  You hide inside for a bit and wash your face.  When you realize you cannot hide forever, you finally work up the courage to leave.  As you return to the living room, you interrupt some kind of argument.

Jerry gulps.  “What is with this chick!?  When she walks in the room she sucks the air out of it…”

The other men share Jerry’s pained expression.

//What the hell is with the atmosphere in here?//

“Are you guys okay?” you ask the silent group.

&quot;No, we are not okay...&quot; Robbie answers.

Every man in sight is breathing heavily and has a visible erection.  

//I have to stop this before things get out of control!//  Your mind settles on what you deem to be the most obvious way out of your predicament.

[[“I am really a man!”]] you blurt out the first thing that comes to mind.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1525" name="“I am really a man!”" tags="" position="2103,13652" size="100,100">All of the men stop moving… but only for a moment.

“Um.  Even if you were a trap, I don’t think I would even care at this point.”

“Me neither, man,” Jimmy agrees.

“I am //NOT// a fuckin’ trap!” you snap at them.

&lt;&lt;if $stripcheck is true&gt;&gt;
“It’s true, man.  I have seen her pussy,” Jerry  attests while making the okay hand sign for perfection.  He then whispers in Robbie&#39;s ear.  You catch only the trail end of his sentence:  “...might just be crazy, who the fuck cares?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“You guys can’t be serious!”


EoC for now :(
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1526" name="impaling your face with his manhood." tags="" position="1605,13591" size="100,100">“Mmmmgfah!” You crane your neck back, gag, and spit it out, horrified that you have now had a penis in your mouth.  //That wasn’t an experience I ever wanted. Fuck!  Damnit, there isn’t enough mouthwash in the world to get rid of this taste!//  Now that you have had  another man’s penis you realize the experience will be with you forever.

“C’mon Taylor!  You made us like this so take some damn responsibility!  I believe in you.  You can take more than just the tip,” Robbie encourages you.

You feel dizzy.  “I…  I don’t know…”

“You don’t know what?”

You feel like you have crossed the border into the realm of insanity.  “I don’t know what’s happening anymore!”

However briefly, you have already tasted a dick… //There is no turning back now...// you think in despair as you resign yourself to your fate. The only way to escape from this moment is to press forward.

“It’s alright.  [[Just be a good girl and suck me off!]]” Robbie orders you.  He seems completely serious.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1527" name="Just be a good girl and suck me off!" tags="" position="1457,13645" size="100,100">“It is like sucking on a finger…” you tell yourself.  //A very big finger...// you think as you look at Robbie’s erection.

You stick out your tongue and Robbie rubs the leaking head of his penis all over your face.  Precum now coats your lips and cheek.  You feel like a slut… and strangely the sensation has its appeal.  The experience is awful but deep down you know it isn’t //completely// bad.  //What the hell is wrong with me?!  I am not enjoying sucking a dick!  This is the worst!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spov.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Robbie grabs the back of your head and forces you down on his cock until your lips touch his balls.

“Oh fuck yeah!  I knew this chick was born for this!” Robbie says as he violently fucks your mouth in front of your friends. “There, take that dick!  C’mon, put a bit more effort into it or we will be here all night!”

//All night!?//  //Ahh… //  You wish he wouldn’t talk anymore.  The awful sounds of you sucking dick permeate the room while your soccer mates eagerly watch on.

“Om.  Ugh…”  You gag and choke as Robbie rams the back of your throat with his cock.

You feel Robbie’s penis begin to throb and pulse in your mouth.  A moment later he fills you with his salty, and blessedly tasteless seed.

You have no other choice but to choke down as much of it as possible.

[[“What about the rest of us?  You can’t leave us hanging!”]] Jerry whines.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1528" name="“What about the rest of us?  You can’t leave us hanging!”" tags="" position="1609,13751" size="100,100">“Don’t worry.  You will get used to the taste eventually,” Robbie assures you.  “Who is up next?” he asks the other guys.

//Ahhh…. //  You silently wish you could fast forward your life a day.

You focus your efforts on the dicks surrounding you. Jerry steps up first with a smile and a bouncing erection.

You are unsure what to do but Evan gently pushes you towards the couch. A second later, Evan and Jerry are both completely naked and seated, erect penises pointing to the ceiling.

You give Evan a withering glare but he just mouths, “Puhleeeease. Thank you.” He seems completely oblivious to the weirdness of the situation.

//What a lost cause...// you think as you look around the room. All the men seem to be consumed by lust. They almost seem to be in some kind of trance. //And here I am the King… or Queen of lost causes… fuck.// You have heard stories of strange moments in history where a group of people have been induced into a collective state of insanity. You are now sure this is one of them. //I would rather drink Cult Koolaid than suck a fucking dick and yet here I am… I have already gone so far. These guys are morons but what’s my excuse?  What the fuck is wrong with me?//

Evan gestures you to move forward and for some bizarre reason you feel compelled to obey.

You kneel on the floor between Evan and Jerry. You wrap your hands around their cocks like ski-pole handles. [[The next thing you know, you are jerking off your friends.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1529" name="awful and awesome night." tags="" position="1857,14156" size="100,100">At this point you can only let everyone finish. With every deep thrust, Evan hits your uterus. You feel like you are on the receiving end of an internal battering ram.

With every toe-curling knock against your inner gates, you feel a bit of yourself slip away.

You don’t like guys. You know this act should feel awful yet it doesn’t.

“Ohh!” //Why am I letting these idiots have sex with me!?//

Evan begins plunging in and out of you at a furious pace until he is red faced and puffing.

With a moan, your best friend withdraws his glistening cock and blows his load all over your stomach, adding his seed to Robbie’s.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/anotherload.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[You haven&#39;t just crossed the line, you have leaped over it.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1530" name="You proceed to awkwardly give Tim a blow job." tags="" position="2002,13952" size="100,100">Eventually Tim takes control, jerking off all over your swaying face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timcum.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhh yeah!  Take it all, girl!” Tim groans as he sprays you with creamy sperm.

“Ahhh… you came so much.”  Every breath you take is imbued with a manly scent.  You feel yourself slipping away, [[your mind gradually goes blank.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1531" name="knock on Mitch’s door." tags="" position="14394,25791" size="100,100">Mitch opens the door with a grin on his face and a gun in hand.  You eye the firearm warily but Mitch relaxes and tucks it away when once he lets you inside.

You avoid mention of his overly paranoid behavior and explain you are only here for some “stuff.”

“Aw, that’s a shame.”

“Can we hurry this up?”

“Pills or powder?” Mitch enquires.

“Whatever is the best deal,” you answer.

Mitch snorts.  “I don’t have any H or meth.  I only have //classy// shit.”

“I would never try fucking heroin.  People die all the time from that shit.  I wasn’t even asking for that!”

“You will be soon.  You already look like a fucking strung out hooker.  You look out of place without my dick in your mouth.”

[[“Fuck you, Mitch!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1532" name="“Fuck you, Mitch!”" tags="" position="14234,25917" size="100,100">Mitch remains calm for about three seconds.  He then pulls you aside with one strong arm.  You expect violence but instead he speaks quietly his words matching his oily smile, “Hey, don’t be that way.  Do you need some extra money?   The good drugs are always expensive, am I right?  I might have some work for ya if you’re interested,” he offers.

“No… I am good.”  //The last thing I want to do is get into Mitch’s debt.  Our current arrangement is bad enough as is...//  “Get me my shit!  Now… //please...//”

You accept a small baggy and leave the apartment as quickly as possible without breaking into a run.  

You head onto campus.  You go to a few classes and regret it.  You dodge a dozen phone calls from your mom and even more from Drew and Evan...

After a horribly boring day, you head home.  You force yourself to have a shower but still feel wretched afterwards.  You look at your depressed looking reflection and sigh.  You look as tired as you feel.  Despite just cleaning yourself, you can’t help but feel a bit dirty and used.

You try to watch a boring movie but turn it off after a few minutes.  [[You soon seek refuge in your baggy.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1533" name="You soon seek refuge in your baggy." tags="" position="14390,25943" size="100,100">The next day you wake up next to an empty bag feeling like a particularly lethargic bag of shit.  With an abnormal level of of apathy, you barely manage to drag yourself out of bed.  You make yourself a tasteless breakfast and find yourself zoning out at the table.

//Fuuuuck…. I feel like shit!  I could really use a pick me up…//  You groan as you recall the empty baggy.

//How in the fuck did I go through all that?  Ahh… my head...//  Your mild hangover-esque sensations intensify.

The first solution for your discomfort that pops into your head is to get high.

“I can’t do that…”  Your parents aren’t due to send you more money until the end of the month.

As hold your phone in hand, you imagine calling your mom and asking for money.

//Oh god… that would be the weirdest conversation ever...//

You plop down at your computer and browse the web until your thoughts wander to Mitch’s offer.

“I can’t ask him for money… can I?”  //What would he make me do for it?// you wonder, liking none of the images that spring to mind.  “No I can’t!  Fuck this!”

You decide to go quit your drug use cold turkey.  You last less three days before you cave and reverse your position.  Your will finally crumbles with a single text message from Mitch.  With your feelings of disgust and shame overwhelmed by your desire to get high, you [[make a now familiar trek back to Mitch&#39;s apartment.]]    
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1534" name="make a now familiar trek back to Mitch&#39;s apartment." tags="" position="14234,26061" size="100,100">
You don&#39;t know why he messaged you so early but you can make an educated guess.  “Fuckin’ perv!” you mutter as you glance down with a scowl of irritation at his vague text requesting that you “help him out.” 

&lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt;//What an arrogant asshole//&lt;/span&gt; you think.  &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt;//Since when does he need my help?//&lt;/span&gt;

As you stand in front of the foreboding apartment complex, you feel sick to your stomach.  //This damn pig has ruined my life!//  You&#39;re hooked on Mitch...  You have become addicted to his abuse and, although it pains you to admit it, you have come to crave his wonderful, powerful cock as well. &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt;//Oh my God! What a cock!  Why does such a dick have such a big dick?  Why the fuck do I keep thinking about it?// &lt;/span&gt;you wonder as ever more strange thoughts invade your mind.  You pause in front of Mitch&#39;s door. //Fuckin’ Mitch…//  This awful man is now your lover, your abuser, your dealer, and the one person who has absolute control over you…

You don’t even have to knock.  Mitch opens the door, as if sensing your presence.  “Hey Taylor! You are looking gorgeous as always. Come on in!”

“Let’s make this quick if possible…”

Mitch grins at you.  “I need your help,” he innocently requests.  “You take care of me and I will take care of you,” Mitch adds with a grin.

Your eyes narrow suspiciously.  “Mitch, what the hell do you want from me?” you ask him with certain disdain.

Something in your tone makes Mitch snap.  “I need you to do something for me, not complain, you insolent fucking bitch!” he explodes.  

[[“I am not going to help if you insult me!”]] you shout back at him.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1535" name="“I am not going to help if you insult me!”" tags="" position="14390,26099" size="100,100">&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/start/slapmitch.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Listen to me, bitch!” Mitch growls as he grabs you by the throat and slaps you across the face. “And listen closely because I will not repeat this!  You&#39;re //mine!//  You belong completely to me.  Do you understand?  //Mine!// Your life; your tits!  Your pussy and your even your damned soul are mine!  And you, Taylor, you are you going to do exactly what I tell you to do or it will be the biggest regret of your life!”

You feel like you are shrinking. You want to run away but find your legs paralyzed, rooted stubbornly in place.  You start to tremble as you have several times since you became a girl.  You feel completely vulnerable, much more so than at any point when you were a guy.  The difference in power between you and Mitch is just too great.

//He is so much bigger than me!  I now have less strength, less muscle mass, less... cock.  Fuck!//  Reminded of your missing manhood, you cringe.  

Now you just have a little damned clit where your pride used to dwell.  //Mitch’s dick and my vagina..uhh…  My vagina...//  A symbol of femininity which has begun to rule your life.  As Mitch holds your windpipe in his strong hands, it becomes completely clear that [[he holds absolute power over your life… at least for now.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1536" name="he holds absolute power over your life… at least for now." tags="" position="14237,26212" size="100,100">“I understand, Mitch!  I get it!  Don&#39;t hit me anymore please!” you fearfully gasp at him when Mitch finally chooses to release you..

“See, that’s much better!  I hope we understand each other, Taylor.  Now that that’s dealt with… Well, I need you go to see my friend Mr. David Robins at his nightclub.  You know that new, fashionable place on the corner of  thirteenth street 5th avenue?”

“The Pink Panther?” you guess.  //That place is pretty glamorous!//  You had tried to get inside over the summer and they wouldn’t let you in.  You recall Julie laughing her ass off when you told her.

“That’s it!” Mitch answers you.  “Robins will be waiting for you there tomorrow at nine sharp.  Tell the bouncer that you are Taylor, Mitch&#39;s slutty girl and he will take you to see my friend.”

“Is it //really// necessary to specify to him that I am your little slut?”

Mitch shakes his head in disbelief.  “Clearly! That&#39;s fundamental, Taylor! Or are you not my little slut?  Come on Taylor, tell me what you are,” Mitch coaxes you.

A lightning flash of shame runs through your feminine body like an immense tidal wave that [[drowns the last remains of your scarce remaining willpower.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1537" name="drowns the last remains of your scarce remaining willpower." tags="" position="14393,26250" size="100,100">You bow your head.  “I… I am your little slut, Mitch!”

“See, that wasn’t so hard, was it?  Doesn’t it feel liberating to admit your true feelings out loud?  Remember: tomorrow... The Pink Panther… David Robins.  For me it&#39;s very important that you do everything he asks you, alright?  I’d ask you to blow me before you go but I got shit to do.  Now get out of here,” Mitch orders you.
 
You go home to rest and stew in your humiliation.
 
The next morning you, go to The Pink Panther as instructed.  At the entrance, you can see a large bouncer guarding the entrance.
 
“What do you want, girl?” the burly man asks you while blocking your path.
 
You take a deep breath.  “I ... I&#39;m here to see Mr. Robins, er, David Robins.”
 
“And who the hell are you!?  Not every slag gets in to see Mr. Robins!”
 
You lick your parched lips and muster up your courage… or what remains of it.  “I… I am Mitch´s slutty girl, Taylor Roux,” you introduce yourself.  You feel completely ashamed as the bouncer begins to guffaw. 
 
“Ha ha ha!  You should have started by saying that, girl!  Ha!  Come on, follow me!” he says, leading [[you inside to a secluded corner of the club.]]

David Robins is now standing in front of you. Checking him out while trying not to be too obvious, you think to yourself, &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt;//“What a handsome man!”//&lt;/span&gt;  In the depths of your being you know that you already like him more than you should. He notices your attention and approaches you with a broad smile. As he moves closer, your legs begin to tremble and your knees feel a little weak.

“Hi, Taylor I presume? How are you doing?” He doesn’t wait for you to respond. “You look like you&#39;re having fun,” he notes. “That body…Mmm.. yes, you are indeed very gorgeous. You have a special //allure// about you. Mitch has told me a lot about you…”

You nod, doing your best to hide your apprehension.

“So, you’re probably wondering what this is all about,” David continues. “Listen closely, I&#39;ve got something very important to tell you. You see… I need a girl to work for a week onboard one of my boats and I think you would be… //perfect!”// 

You open your mouth to ask a question but Robins smoothly speaks over you.

“Do you like to dance?” he suddenly asks you.

“Sure, I like to dance!” you answer him with as much enthusiasm as you can muster.

“Mitch thinks you’re the perfect girl. He also told me that you like to be fucked hard. [[Is that really true?]]”

Hoping to avoid both incarceration and an early grave, you sneak into Julie’s room and have a quick snoop around. You awkwardly push aside a dildo and a bottle of massage oil to open up your sister’s jewelry box.

Inside is a few gaudy, oversized earrings and your sister’s passport.

“Jackpot! This should do nicely. If they ask where my driver’s license is I will just say I lost it.”

//Just tell the truth.  Keep it simple.  Don’t elaborate and don’t lie,// you mentally coach yourself.  You go over your story one last time before you make the call.

“Hi, I am the, uh, woman, that was on the news.  I was near the hospital with the murder…” you trail off.

The operator pauses for a second before answering.  “We will send a squad car right away.   What is your current location?”

You give the address of a nearby park and tell them you will be there shortly.

“What is your name?” asks the operator.

[[“Julie Roux,” you reply before hanging up.]]

“Okay… Let’s see if I can morph or whatever the hell it is I do... Fuck, I will never get used to this!” you mutter as focus on altering your features.

After a moment of intense concentration, your face suddenly softens and changes like plasticine that is slowly moulded by some invisible sculptor into your sister’s likeness.

It takes a surprising amount of effort but soon you have duplicated Julie’s appearance down to her light smattering of freckles and slightly darker hair color.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/jroux.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uhh….  This feels soooo creepy!  I am like wearing my sister’s skin-ewww!”  You suppress a shiver.  //Wait, that isn’t quite right…  This is my body.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/policecar.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

You wave and then timidly walk over to it.

The police officer rolls down his window before stepping out and greeting you.  “You’re Julie?” says the cop as you approach.

You nod and get in the back of the car.  [[The officer whisks you away to the station.]]

You timidly wait in the lobby for about ten minutes as they check your passport and take some basic information.

Afterwards you are escorted into a tiny room for an interview.

After uncomfortable moment alone, a detective enters and reads you your rights.  “Do you understand?” he presses you.

“Yes.”

“So, Julie, are you ready to talk to us about what happened?”

“Yes.”

“Let’s start at the beginning.  Why were you at the hospital?”

The detective nods thoughtfully as if your answer was more honest than he expected.  “Who dared you?”

You sigh as if letting loose a weighty secret.  “The internet,” you admit with a blush.

“Come again?”

“I saw this video on VidTube about people exploring abandoned buildings.  It looked like fun,” you elaborate.  “Then I noticed the hospital on my way home from work.  I told my … brother, Taylor about it and he told me not to go but that kind of pissed me off because it felt a bit like he was giving me an order - Taylor can be a cunt sometimes - so I went out there and then things got kind of weird…”

“I see… So you went to the hospital.  Did you go by yourself?”

[[“Yes, I was alone.”]]
[[“No, I had a friend…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1544" name="“I was on a date.”" tags="" position="10444,34389" size="100,100">//Damnit, I really didn’t want to involve Drew in this…  But I don’t really have a choice.//

“I was with Drew Drachmann.  We were on a... date…”

“You were on a //date// at an //abandoned hospital?//  That sounds a tad... ridiculous,” remarks a very skeptical detective.

“It is true!” you insist.  “Drew can back up everything I am saying!”

“Why is this the first we are hearing of this!?” shouts the suddenly irate detective.  “And where is //Drew//?”

“I just didn’t want to get him into trouble,” you answer, doing your best innocent cute girl impression.

“//Unbelievable.//  Your troubles are just getting started.”

“He can corroborate everything I am saying!” you repeat.

&quot;For your sake, I hope that is true.&quot;

The detective leaves you in the interrogation room.

The detective swallows nervously.  There is a noticeable pause before he continues his questions.  “Did you meet or see the security guard at any point during your excursion?”

“I saw him at a distance when I entered.  I saw his flashlight too, so I avoided that area.”

“So your paths never crossed?  You never exchanged any words?”  

You consider the detective’s overly specific questions, knowing that your answer will probably be important.  //Except it isn’t clear what he knows… Of course, he could just be bluffing...//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1549" name="Meet his gaze" tags="" position="9904,34835" size="100,100">You calmly meet the detective’s gaze.

“I didn’t do shit,” you insist.

You engage in a staring contest for the better part of a minute.  Finally the detective’s demeanor changes, from neutral inquiry to something approaching friendliness.

“I believe you.  Did you see or hear anyone else while you were at the hospital?”

“No.”

“I appreciate your forthrightness.”

“I am really sorry about the guy but I am afraid I don’t know anything more.”

“I understand.  Well, Julie, thank you for your time.  We will call you if we have any questions,” the detective says as he ushers you out of the interview room.  [[“You are free to go,”]] he adds casually.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1550" name="Look away" tags="" position="9755,34836" size="100,100">“I can tell you aren’t being completely honest with us. Start at the beginning and tell me the truth.”

You repeat your story to the frowning detective.

“Wait here,” he orders you, disappearing into the hall.

They leave you inside the room for at least half an hour. You begin to feel fidgety and agitated.

//What the fuck is taking them so long?//

Eventually the detective returns. “I want you to tell me your story again. This time I want you to tell me what //actually// happened.”

“I already told you….”

“Tell me again. Don’t leave anything out.”

An agonizing afternoon later, you feel like your brain has been turned to mush. The pressure and constant questioning has begun to take its toll. You have clearly stepped on some toes, and the police seem eager to connect you to the murder.

“So you have never met or spoken with Mr. Gilmesh?”

“I already told you guys, no!” you reply in exasperation.

“Well, Julie, we know you are lying to us. What you’re saying does not match the evidence at hand.”

“What evidence!? What the hell are you guys talking about? I want a lawyer so I can sue you bastards.”

As soon as you invoke your rights the police become stoney faced.

[[You feel like you may have made your situation even worse.]]

You sigh. “I am so fucking glad that is over… I am definitely not made for prison.” //Especially now, // you think as you look at your dainty hands.

You decide to head home, leaving yourself in Julie’s form to avoid the chance of being called a mutant. Although it is more than a bit weird using a copy of your sister’s body, you hope you might learn something useful from literally walking a few miles in Julie’s shoes.

You are making your way towards campus when you spot a friendly face standing amidst the players of a soccer game. 

//Is that //Evan?!

&quot;Hey Julie!&quot; &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt; runs over and greets you in a gruff, deep voice.

“Why are you talking like that?”

“What do you mean?”

//That&#39;s right! He thinks I am Julie! What should I do?// You’re a bit surprised that Evan is ignoring the game in favor of talking to you. You suddenly have an urge to tease him a bit.

“Nevermind.”

“Are you out for a walk?”

&quot;Uh…&quot;

Drew looks somewhat confused.  “Julie?”

“Yes, Drew!  It is me, //Julie//, your //girlfriend.//”

Drew’s confusion morphs into alarm as you grab his arm.

“We went to the hospital together, remember? These guys want to know what we did...”

Drew blinks rapidly for a moment but suddenly freezes.  He then nods thoughtfully.  //I hope that means he figured out what is going on… I wish I would have realized I was a shitty liar a bit earlier so we could have had some time to get out stories straight… oh well.//

Drew gives you a shy smile.  “Taylor, I will always be here for you.”  Drew then moves up to you and whispers, “That’s you, right? Of course it is… Julie would never call me…” he mumbles.

Since he answered his own question, you just laugh. “Just be honest,” you advise with a wink. //Just not too honest...// You hope Drew doesn’t mention any discrepancies.

&quot;This lipstick is a bit much. I am sure Drew will appreciate it though...&quot;

You sigh, half hoping Bloom will hurry up. //Or maybe I want her to take her time? Agh… I need to relax!// You unsuccessfully attempt to shake the cobwebs from your head.

You take things step by step, day by day, hour by hour… and time slips inexorably away, each second adding to the permanence of your condition.

“How in the fuck is already the end of November?” you wonder aloud. You momentarily imagine Christmas with your family and feel ill. //Yeah, that would definitely be the most awkward Christmas ever...//

You sit down at your computer and browse the web for a bit, noting that many of the ads and banners have become season themed, [[unsubtly urging you to consume.]]

You recall your gift for Drew’s birthday and blush furiously.

“I really wish I could just shut off the dirty part of my mind for a few months. //Fuck, why is the thought of dressing up for Drew so exciting?//

The idea sticks in your mind.  You are certain the gift that Drew would appreciate the most would involve something lewd.  //Or maybe I should just get him a book or video game… I am sure Drew would love anything I get him.// Yet such ideas make you feel cheap.

A couple days later at Drew’s, you find yourself drawn to Drew’s computer while he makes a snack in the kitchen.

You open up a familiar folder on the desktop. Thousands of pornographic images load in front of your eyes.

You feel a bit bad for snooping, but you tell yourself it is for a good purpose.

You immediately recognize the petite pornstar, Randy Riley from your own porn collection.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/xmasriley.jpg&quot;&gt;
//Fuck, he REALLY likes Randy... // The observation solidifies another idea deep within you mind.

You step away from Drew’s PC and sit down in the living room right before Drew returns from the kitchen.

You enjoy nachos and cheese while watching random nettube videos with Drew.

Once you are back home, you order a few things online for next day delivery. 

A day later, you show up at Drew’s with your package in hand. You fidget a moment on his doorstep, naughty thoughts pervading your mind.

Drew smiles brightly at you when he opens the door.

“Hey Drew!”

“Taylor… What’s that?”

“You will see. Just give me a sec; I need to use the washroom.”

You dash by Drew and go to change.

“Wait a sec…” You realize that your bustier alter ego bears a striking resemblance to this particular porn star.

//And Drew clearly enjoyed that particular transformation...//

“Hmmm!” A naughty idea further coalesces in your mind. “Simple and awesome is probably the best.”

“It’s okay,” Drew assures you. “Let’s go.”

Once you are outside the station you ask Drew the obvious question on your mind. “What did you say to them?”

Drew explains that he answered the questions honestly. Luckily Drew seems to have provided a solid alibi. “The only thing I left out was that I went with Taylor, not Julie… but I didn’t lie about it.  The detective didn’t seem to notice though, he was more transfixed on how I got such a hot girlfriend...”

You giggle. “Thanks, Drew… you saved me again!” you chime with a sultry smile. You plant a wet kiss on Drew’s crimson cheek.

Glad your legal issues seem to be resolved, [[you head to Drew’s place.]]

Drew watches your transformation with amazement. “Wow… That is so much cooler than //AnimalMorphs!//” remarks an astounded Drew.

“Drew, this isn’t a god damned kid’s story!”

“You’re right… It is real life. Our life,” Drew thoughtfully replies.

//That’s right… this is my fucking life.// Somehow dodging a murder charge does little to boost your mood.

The only bright aspect of your life involves the man walking beside you.  //I am glad Drew came to bail me out again...//

You sit down on the couch next to Drew and fall asleep within moments.

Some time later, you open your eyes. Drew’s face is near your own. He looks so tranquil that his sense of contentment is contagious. You curl up closer to Drew like a little kitten.  You feel warm and safe. Sleep beckons you and you do not resist the call.

You wake up when Drew begins to stir.

“Sorry!” Drew whispers apologetically. “I really wanted to let you sleep but… I //really// have to go pee.”

You laugh as you untangle yourself from Drew.

You see your phone flash on the coffee table. [[You nearly start jumping up and down with excitement when you read the message.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1562" name="Transform into the pornstar for Drew" tags="" position="10547,36641" size="100,100">Your irises fade in color and then shift in pigment until they are green. You shed several inches of height and feel a tad dizzy as your already slender body loses a significant amount of mass before your very eyes.

Your clothes slip off your slender frame and you tug the rest free.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/riley2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Soon you have Riley’s body imitated down to her cute little bush. You stand and admire your naked body in the mirror.

“Well… fuck…” It feels a bit weird to be a clone of one of the most fapped over women ever.
&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to false&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $riley to true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;
Feeling the familiar acrobatics of butterflies within your stomach, you head out into the living room wearing your new costume.

“~Hey Drew! Merry Christmas... to you!” you tease.

Drew takes one look at you and his jaw drops almost to the floor. Before Drew’s eyes can pop completely out of his head, you begin to [[show off your season themed costume.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1563" name="show off your season themed costume." tags="" position="10700,36687" size="100,100">“//R-R-R-Randy Riley!?//” Drew sputters. For a moment, he sounds like Scooby-Doo.

“Kind of. More like… Riley Roux?” you suggest.

“//Taylor… Why…?//”

//That’s a really good question that I wish I knew the answer to...// You keep your confused feelings to yourself.

“Because Christmas is here! And Riley Roux is here to spread some cheer,” you answer with a giggle as you continue to show off your costume and lithe, tight, young body.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/xmasporn.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Holy fuh…” Drew mumbles as he stares at your display. //Was that almost a swear?// It amuses you immensely to provoke such an uncharacteristic reaction from Drew.

The way he looks at you with such adoration and longing ignites a desire within you to please him. You show off your costume for Drew, all the way down to your white satin panties. You play with your tassel and give Drew your most alluring smile while swaying slightly side to side.

You can feel Drew’s adoration transform into a more tangible desire. He begins to breathe loudly, each breath more ragged than the last.

[[You decide to press your erotic momentum.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1564" name="You decide to press your erotic momentum." tags="" position="10548,36789" size="100,100">“Hey ~Drew! Check out these babies!”

You raise your shirt and show off your petite breasts. Although they are much smaller than your other transformations, there is something undeniably attractive and youthful about your modest chest.

Drew silently admires you, not daring to even touch you.

To your embarrassment, you notice your nipples are hard… much like Drew’s penis (if the tent in his pants is any indication).

You find teasing Drew to be enormously amusing… [[and arousing.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1565" name="and arousing." tags="" position="10700,36839" size="100,100">“You want to see my butt next?” you enquire with a sultry smile. Drew hesitates a split second and then nods so eagerly you can’t help but laugh.

“This is like… a fantasy within a fantasy crammed into a dream!” Drew huffs.  “//Fantaception!// Wait, what if we added orange soda to the mix!? I didn’t think this could get any better.”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/xmasass.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You ignore Drew, bending over while giving your backside a suggestive back and forth wiggle.

Soon the only sound in the room is Drew’s heavy breathing… and your own thundering heart beat that suddenly seems to be thundering so loudly it is almost eclipsing every other sense except for an undeniable yearning that is slowly awakening deep within you.

[[Since Drew seems transfixed, you decide to take the initiative.]]

You kneel down between Drew’s legs and rub his groin.

With a wicked grin you begin to unwrap your “xmas gift.” You unzip Drew and are presented with a hard dick yearning for the touch of your soft hands.

A few light strokes and Drew comes alive in your hand. His arousal feeds your own and soon your urge to use more than your hands becomes overwhelming. You feel Drew’s pulse through his stiff penis. You feel like you have his life held in the palm of your hand.

Unable to torture yourself or Drew any longer, [[you lean over and kiss Drew’s penis.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1567" name="you lean over and kiss Drew’s penis." tags="" position="10700,36991" size="100,100">That action sets off a chain reaction. Even though it is gross and wrong (and more than a bit weird) you have a desire to further taste Drew’s penis.

You extend your tongue and become an instant lost cause.

Guided by Drew’s encouraging moans, you swirl your tongue over Drew’s cockhead while jerking him off.

As you stroke Drew and internalize your role as a pornstar, you feel yourself slipping away.  //That’s right, I am Randy Riley and I am super randy… I think I need to take a cue out of her book...//

Drew’s groaning intensifies as your mouth fills with an increasing amount of salty fluid. You can tell Drew is approaching his limit.

You jerk Drew off and let him release all of his pent up sperm in your mouth. You revel in the act of pleasing your friend until you finish your duty of [[milking Drew to completion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1569" name="milking Drew to completion." tags="" position="10696,37135" size="100,100">You now have a mouth full of your best friend’s semen but you are not content to leave any behind.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/xmasswallow.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You open your mouth and let Drew exult in your oral display. He silently stares down at you with a look of intense adoration coupled with confusion as if he has no idea what to say or do.

Yet speaking is impossible in your current state.  You let your sloppy mouth of cum speak for you.

Knowing Drew would appreciate your show, you continue to roll his huge load around your tongue. You hold the slightly bitter fluid in your mouth acting as if you are savoring the taste.

“Mmmmm…..”

After a few seconds, it becomes less of an act when you realize how incredibly turned on you are.

//Drew loves it… and maybe it isn’t the worst feeling in the world to be able to provide such pleasure to another person.// You cannot help but be jealous that you never got to experience something similar.

You greedily swallow every drop of Drew&#39;s semen and then present your friend with your bare tongue.

Just as Drew looks like he is about to topple over, you continue one last round of service, gently massaging his cock and licking up any remainders you may have missed.

“Merry Christmas, Drew!” you purr.

Maybe that was why you didn’t completely freak out.  Sure a lot of things had changed, but most of your life had stayed the surprisingly constant.  You still eat, drink, shower, and shit.  You still go to the same places and enjoy the same things for the most part. Your mind is still occupied by the same useless studies.  //I am still me//, you tell yourself, even if your body still occasionally gives you shocks of unfamiliarity.

People look at you a little differently, your friends included, but there wasn’t anything you could do about it except keep living your life while patiently trying to uncover a way to change back.

This might be it! My last night as a chick!” you declare.  Drew stops in his tracks.

“What did you say?” asks a stunned Drew. He seems to have not heard a word you have said to him.

“Bloom,” you answer pointing at your phone. “This fucking nightmare is almost over!” You instantly realize how insensitive your last comment was. “Drew, the only good thing about all of this has been you. Thank you!”

Drew meets your gaze. “I feel almost the same way,” he answers.

You sigh. //My last night as a chick!?// You lick your lips nervously. You are undeniably excited to return to the way you once were but that is hardly your only emotion. //It is good news. So why do I feel so uneasy?//

You look down at your breasts and then over at Drew.  Drew gives you a weak smile.

//Damn… it looks like Drew’s dream girl is about to disappear forever.//  You are surprised that the sentiment makes you feel more than a bit sad as well.

“You’re not curious?” you pout.

“I-I- I... Taylor, I don’t know what to say.”

“Hah, I was just joking, Drew. Sheesh, you should have seen your face!” you tease him.  “Let’s just hang out and play games like we always do. How about //Battle Fighter III//?” you suggest.

Drew’s face brightens a bit at the mention of the game. “That would be… great.”

Two minutes later, you and Drew are locked in mortal combat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/combatgame.jpg&quot;&gt;
You become acutely aware of the game’s dwindling timer, seeming to underscore the urgency of your own situation.  //Fuck, am I really going to spend my last night like this playing games?//

You have an inkling to play a game of a different sort.

//This is probably my last chance if I want to tease Drew...// The thought ignites a mischievous spark within you.

You stand up and block Drew’s line of sight with your ass. Drew doesn’t object. He somehow continues to play in autopilot and manages to score a few lucky blind hits on you.

You up your own game, shimmying backwards until you sit on Drew’s lap. Drew&#39;s arms wrap around your waist. Drew then splits his efforts between the game and your body, one hand on the controller, the other pawing at your breast.

You can’t believe ou are letting Drew feel you up in such a brazen manner.  You are torn with indecision.  You know this situation is at least partly your fault...or mostly your fault.  It doesn’t help things at all that Drew’s touch does admittedly feel more than a little bit pleasant.  Despite your internal confusion, you can feel yourself gradually heating up.  //Damn this body… and my dirty, curious mind!  Uhh...// You know you are out of control but you cannot help yourself.

You zone out for a moment until the sensation of Drew cupping your breasts shocks you back to reality.  You nearly drop the controller.  He finds the nearly imperceptible outline of your rapidly hardening nipples through your bra.  He then traces delicate circles around them.  It isn’t long before you lose focus on the game entirely.

Drew, however, does not.  He seems content to multi-task, [[rubbing you while still putting on a formidable effort on screen.]]

You twist on the couch and look back at Drew, study his round face. He looks like a man caught between heaven and hell. Drew’s obvious pain and confusion adds to your own.

//Of course he would probably prefer I stay like this… I can’t really blame him either… Fuck.//

You bite your lip as your thoughts turn dirty. “A day...”  //My last night as a woman...// You recall how terrified you were at the hospital and how you could have easily been killed. //And we would have died virgins… fuck, that’s so said.// As you shift your legs, you become uncomfortably aware of how your wet underwear is.  //God damnit… I want to do it… I //really// want to have sex and there is only one person I can possibly ask...// It isn’t like this is your duty or anything, merely a way to kill two birds with a single stone.

[[“Drew, let’s go to your bedroom.”]]
[[“I have to go! Talk-to-you-later!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1578" name="“Drew, let’s go to your bedroom.”" tags="" position="10703,35389" size="100,100">Drew blinks rapidly as the gravity of your request sinks in. He swallows loudly before finding his voice. “Taylor, are you… sure?”

His three word question twists the knife you feel piercing your guts.

You decide it is pointless to lie. “Yes, I am sure,” you answer.

//I guess there is no real harm in this...//

You lead a silent Drew into his own bedroom. You sit on the edge of his bed for a moment, before taking your shirt off.

You strip for Drew, casting off your garments as if they were heavy burdens.

You are now standing naked before Drew. You feel nervous, passive yet dangerously powerful, as you lie back on Drew’s bed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taywaiting2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Drew seems to have been turned to stone.

[[You do your best to encourage him.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spread.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnngghhh…” Drew makes a wheezing noise but still doesn’t move.

You decide Drew needs further “encouragement.” [[You begin to masturbate for Drew’s pleasure… and your own.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1581" name="You begin to masturbate for Drew’s pleasure… and your own." tags="" position="10703,35541" size="100,100">You cup your breasts and then rub your clit in delicate circular motions. Masturbating in front of someone is even more exciting than solo play. You feel a growing pressure and keep fondling yourself with greater urgency until you cum in front of Drew.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylormasturbate.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With a love juice covered finger you beckon Drew forth.

Drew’s reluctance seems to leave him, boiled off like a fog under hot sun.  With heavy breathing and palpable nervousness, Drew rips off his clothing and moves closer to you, repositioning in front of your sex.

For a moment you take in Drew’s appearance.  Your eyes ghost over his curly brown hair, past his intensely eager expression, beyond his big belly, and finally land upon Drew’s pink penis. //Your [[best friend’s penis]]!//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1582" name="best friend’s penis" tags="" position="10543,35587" size="100,100">You watch Drew line up his manhood in front of your pussy.

Drew’s dick isn’t exactly large, it is about the same size that yours used to be, perhaps even a little bit smaller.  //Ick!!!//  The line of thought promotes rebellion in your brain.  //I am really thinking about DICKS!  No- it is even worse than that!// you realize.  //Jesus merciful-fucking Christ!! I want to feel one inside me.//  You may have long ago fallen down the rabbit hole and there was no way back up to the safety of sanity except playing maddening games.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fpovreality.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Drew is already panting, softly rubbing the head of his penis against your glistening, wet folds. The insanity of the night has made Drew abandon his cautious nature. You feel like you have entered a similar state, long ago having thrown common sense to the wind.

[[Think about your situation for a moment.]]
[[Request Drew use protection]]x

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1583" name="Think about your situation for a moment." tags="" position="10700,35689" size="100,100">You close your eyes and try to compose yourself as much as possible in such a compromising position. In the darkness of your own mind, you are left with only the distraction of your arousal.

“Uhh….”  You feel a strange yearning, almost like an internal itch. Yet, you can only see a single way to scratch it properly. You want to fuck. You want to feel Drew’s dick inside you.

“Put it in, Drew,” you softly command.  “Let’s both become adults together...just make sure you pull out when you need to.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drewinsert.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With your words of encouragement, the last vestiges of Drew’s self control crumbles.  “Ohhh my god, Taylor!  I have dreamed about this,” Drew confesses as his penis presses into your hot vagina. His leaking glans rubs against your wet folds and it&#39;s plain what you both want.

“Drew, seriously. Just be quiet and fuck me.”

“With pleasure, my lady,” Drew says.  You imagine a mental fedora hatip and almost laugh despite the awkward circumstances.

The thought disappears, replaced by the sensation of a hot spear of flesh pushing inside you.

//Holy fucking shit...this is really happening.  I am losing my virginity to Drew Drachmann… ughh… and he is losing his to me!  [[What the fuck is wrong with us!?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1584" name="Request Drew use protection" tags="" position="10398,35685" size="100,100">alt scene EoC</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1585" name="What the fuck is wrong with us!?" tags="" position="10548,35739" size="100,100">“Uhhnn…. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh….” Drew moans as he begins to penetrate you, his wet shaft sinking into your virgin pussy.  Drew starts slowly at first, gradually easing into you and spreading your nether regions apart.  As soon as he pushes his penis inside you, his eyes go wide as your warm, wet folds grasp him more tightly that any hand ever could.  Drew studies your face, then looks down at his buried cock, then back and forth, clearly amazed at the sight.  Thankfully, he doesn’t speak, just choosing to breathe heavily as he marvels at the moment while obviously savouring the sensations of his first time.  It is clear from Drew’s pinched, red face this is one of the most pleasurable moments of his life.

For you it isn’t //quite// the same.  Drew’s dick isn’t huge by any means but its entry has caused you a large degree of discomfort and a fair bit of pain.  //But this is nothing!// you tell yourself.  Compared to Drew’s hospitalization, you realize your pain is irrelevant.  You bite your lip and aim to stoically bear whatever Drew chooses to do to you.

With agonizing slowness, your friend begins to move his manhood in and out of you.  It only takes a couple thrusts before he is drenched with sweat and staring at you intently with a look of absolute disbelief.

//I know...I feel the same way… Even though it seems impossible, this is really happening. I have a fucking dick inside me...//  Not long ago, imagining having sex with Drew would have been a funny but quite absurd joke.  Yet now this had moved beyond the realm of fantasy and humour...to //real// sexual intercourse…[[with one of your oldest and closest friends.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1586" name="with one of your oldest and closest friends." tags="" position="10704,35837" size="100,100">Drew’s mouth opens as if to release a pleasurable moan but no sound escapes his lips.  Drew begins to slowly push his cock inside you before withdrawing with the same aching slowness.  After a few minutes, you begin to notice a change going on in your head.  You suddenly realize that Drew’s penis no longer causes you pain and that your discomfort has faded to a subtle, wet, yearning warmth.

//Fwap. Fwap. Fwap...//

“Oh my….Uh….UH!  I am having sex with Taylor Roux! Aghhh… Ah...” Drew mumbles in a state of sexual delirium. His apparent disbelief over the situation mirrors your own.

//Yes you are...//  You are having sex with your best friend and slowly starting to feel good. It is an absolutely surreal experience.

You cannot reconcile how something so fundamentally wrong feels so absolutely right.

“You’re so...warm and wet...uhh I can’t take it!  This is the best feeling in the world!”  //Holy fuck!  I am having sex with Drew Drachmann...as a woman...//  You look at your crotch in disbelief as Drew thrusts in and out of your vagina.  //My vagina?  Uh...// Everything about this moment is so weird and confusing.  //This is real.  This is happening...I am fucking my best friend...and it feels good!//  You feel your metaphorical hamster fall off the wheel in your mind.  Your mind goes blank until [[all you can feel is Drew’s penis moving inside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1587" name="all you can feel is Drew’s penis moving inside you." tags="" position="10548,35883" size="100,100">
 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/drewfuckcumin.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You have barely even begun to enjoy yourself, when suddenly Drew gives you a look of wild-eyed panic.  He then begins to pump into you rapidly, his frantic breathing conveying that he is nearing his limit.

//Already?// You think with disappointment.  You were just starting to feel decent too.  Yet it is already too late to delay the inevitable..

Drew’s bobbing belly takes up your view as he tries to get as deep into your tight little pussy as possible.  You feel Drew’s thrusting cock bulge and shake inside you, releasing a huge gout of semen into your deep recesses.

Your intercourse was brief, lasting for at most ten minutes.  You vaguely feel a bit unsatisfied but that changes when you see Drew’s absolutely blissful expression.  He looks like he just won the lottery ten times in a row and then ate a big bowl of fudge.  Drew is clearly overwhelmed with pleasure,  the happiest you have seen him in years… [[or possibly ever.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1588" name="or possibly ever." tags="" position="10704,35985" size="100,100">You feel a strange sense of accomplishment as Drew withdraws from you. He leaves behind a copius amount of warm sperm.

Drew sucks in several huge breaths.  “You’re the greatest, Taylor...the greatest…” Drew whispers to you with unfocused eyes.  He rolls off you and onto the bed beside you.

Your heads happen to land side by side, your faces pointed at each other.  You look deep into Drew’s green eyes and find yourself not feeling //quite// as ashamed as you would have imagined.  You have just given the ultimate favour, the most personal and intimate gift you possess.

It is clear that Drew will never forget what you have done for him.  You share similar sentiments: your strange experience will be forever etched within your mind.

Drew closes his eyes.  Just when you suspect he has fallen asleep, Drew sits up in bed.

“Drew?”

“Taylor…  You have made me feel like… a person… like a real man… I will never be able to thank you but I want to make you feel good too!” Drew says as he begins to caress your body.

His hands soon make their way to your pussy where Drew probes your vagina with an enquiring finger.  He penetrates you with his fingertips just enough to [[stir the embers of your arousal into a raging bonfire.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1589" name="stir the embers of your arousal into a raging bonfire." tags="" position="10548,36035" size="100,100">“Drew, do you wanna try again?  Our time is limited.  We both might as well get the most of the experience.”

Your second time is more enjoyable than your first, your third more than your second...
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drewsexpov.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Oh my god… having sex as a chick is fucking awesome!//

You thoroughly enjoy your new body while Drew quickly learns how to pleasure you properly.

Drew gets you off with his fingers and his tongue.

You and Drew continue to have sex until your pussy is raw.  You explore each other’s bodies and manage to orgasm with a penis inside you. Despite the pain, you are determined to continue up until the moment you get the expected call from Dr. Bloom.

[[About mid afternoon your phone finally rings.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1590" name="About mid afternoon your phone finally rings." tags="" position="10700,36133" size="100,100">You crawl across the bed to answer it. “Hello!”

“Hi, Taylor… It’s Fantasia.” You can immediately tell by the doctor’s tone that something is off.

You begin to pace around the room. “What happened?”

“I am afraid there was an accident at the lab,” explains Dr. Bloom. “We lost two of the containment wings and a couple dozen staff-ahh- that’s not important…” Bloom trails off, showing a rare bit of indecisiveness. “What is important is that it will take me conservatively at least a month to rebuild. I am afraid reversing your transformation will be more difficult than I had earlier anticipated.”

Your blood runs cold as the ramifications sink in.  //I am fucking stuck like this for who knows how long…  Shit!!//

You look down at the cum dripping down your leg, unsure whether to laugh or cry.  //I went way too damned far… now what?//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumleg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Please do your best,” you tell Bloom and hang up in a state of disbelief.

The only thing you are sure of is that Drew will be happy.

[[You have no other choice except to wait.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1591" name="You have no other choice except to wait." tags="" position="10546,36185" size="100,100">A month passes by.  Your life changes surprisingly little.  Maybe that was why you didn’t completely freak out.  Sure a lot of things had changed, but most of your activities stayed surprisingly constant.  The only exception was your time with Drew.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fuckingstuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You still eat, drink, shower, and shit.  You still go to the same places and enjoy the same things for the most part. Your mind is still occupied by the same useless studies.  //I am still me//, you tell yourself, even if your feminine body still occasionally gives you shocks of unfamiliarity.

People look at you a little differently, your friends included, but there wasn’t anything you could do about it except keep living your life while patiently trying to uncover a way to change back.  You believe that Bloom is still your best bet but your patience is far from eternal. Your efforts so far have been ineffective [[but you cannot imagine giving up the search.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1592" name="Is that really true?" tags="" position="14389,26398" size="100,100">You remain silent so Robins continues.

“I hear you like being treated like a little... //Slut!//&quot; He laughs before adding, &quot;And of course you also like money too. Don&#39;t you?  Am I right or am I wrong?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/start/robins01.jpg&quot;&gt;
You recall your instructions that Mitch impressed upon you.   You fight down your queasiness and feelings of shame.  
 
“I enjoy sex,” you admit.  [[“And who doesn’t like money?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1593" name="“And who doesn’t like money?”" tags="" position="14241,26504" size="100,100">“I knew I had the right girl!

Not only is he handsome, he has such refined tastes too... and such beautiful blue eyes… wait, why am I admiring this guy?// Your thoughts are all jumbled up around this remarkably attractive gentleman. Robins pours a second glass for you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/start/robins02.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;I have many informants, with eyes and ears everywhere,” he begins to brag.  “They always let me know when they notice someone with such potential,&quot; Robins continues, opening his eyes wide as he passes you the glass, &quot;You see Taylor, I&#39;m not one to judge you for how you&#39;ve been acting. There&#39;s nothing wrong with enjoying sex or even having as much sex as you can... but if you add a bit of money to it, you can enjoy it even more!. When you add a lot of money instead well, that&#39;s even better, right?  [[Don´t you agree?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1594" name="Don´t you agree?" tags="" position="14389,26546" size="100,100">“I suppose that’s true,” you answer.

“I think you are the perfect person for a job. I use the yacht to host parties on the sea far from the prying eyes of the authorities. I have one such a trip next Saturday. Due to a last minute cancellation, I need to cover a dancer and a waitress on board the ship. Now, I am in need of a charming and very attractive girl to fill that position. Currently my boat is on an island in the South Pacific,” he explains.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/start/robins03.jpg&quot;&gt;

//A free cruise! Hell yeah!// “How long would I be needed for?” you excitedly interrupt him.  

“One week. You&#39;ll only be working as a dancer and as a “Purple Girl” for our VIP clients on the yacht; if you want to do something extra, of course that’s great too,&quot; he winks at you, seeing your eyes widen in understanding. 

“You want me to //serve// the men?” you guess. //I doubt he means just appetizers...//

“Ah-ha, I see you understand. Smart //and// pretty,&quot; Robins replies, while taking a sip of Scotch from his glass. [[&quot;The decision is up to you, of course!&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1595" name="The next thing you know, you are jerking off your friends." tags="" position="1453,13793" size="100,100">Your hands appear tiny measured against the towering phalluses. You grip them apprehensively at first but that soon changes. Although you feel a tad sick to your stomach, you become determined to see this experience through.

“I hope you fucking morons appreciate this,” you mutter as you get to work.

Your soft fingers glide up and down their shafts.  Soon both dicks are weeping precum and you have settled into a surreal routine.

“Taylor!” Evan moans your name, his voice pained.

“What!?”

“Please suck on it…”

“No way! This has to be enough!”

“But your hand feels so good, I just imagine if you used those beautiful lips and wrapped them around my cock...ahhh….”

You stop your movements. “You should be grateful!” you snap.

“I am but… why does fucking //Robbie// get a blowjob and I get nothing but a lousy handjob? How the fuck is that fair?” 

You can’t believe how stupid Evan sounds. “Are you kidding me!? Life isn’t fucking fair!” you explode.

//That’s right… life isn’t fair...// You take a moment and think about how you somehow arrived at this weird moment of your life.

Your thoughts make you sad. //Life isn’t fair… but that doesn’t mean that I should act that way… I already let Robbie do what he wanted while they watched, it isn’t like I can refuse Evan… or any of them after that... Shit!//

You feel a bit queasy when you realize you might be here for a while.
 
[[When you finally lower your head over Evan’s cock all the men in the room cheer.]]

You wrap your hand around Evan’s dick, marveling at his size and hardness. //Damnit, here I go again...//

You begin to pleasure Evan orally. You start with a wet kiss. Soon you are smothering Evan’s dick with your hot tongue and mouth.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cocklick6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your lack of experience is demonstrated in the awkwardness of your movements. But you’re a quick study and making Evan feel good isn’t exactly the most difficult assignment you have conquered.

“Ahhh…” you pull back from Evan, a strand of saliva connecting your lips to Evan’s glans.

“Ahem,” [[Jerry makes a coughing noise to get your attention.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1597" name="Jerry makes a coughing noise to get your attention." tags="" position="1449,13941" size="100,100">“Oh, sorry…” You grab Jerry’s weiner and split your attentions between the two men as efficiently as possible.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/groupwork.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hey Taylor, can you please do mine too?” Jerry asks you as you bob up and down on Evan’s penis.

“Uh… I guess…” You shift your attention to Jerry, covering his cockhead with your mouth. In reward for your benevolence, you receive a rancid fishy taste in your mouth.

//I can’t believe how quickly this escalated….//

Just when you think Jerry and Evan are about to cum, [[Tim and Jimmy join the fray.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1598" name="Tim and Jimmy join the fray." tags="" position="1601,14052" size="100,100">“We felt left out,” Jimmy explains.

“We can’t have that!” Robbie chimes in from the sidelines with exaggerated seriousness.

//How many of these gross things am I going to have to touch? … All of them...// You answer your own question and wince.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/group.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You rise to your knees and begin to service two men at once. You stroke and suck on your friends until it seems like everyone in the room is moaning, caught up in a state of mad sexual delirium.

There are just too many dicks for you to touch at once but the men seem uncaring. You feel yourself detach from the moment as if you are looking down on yourself, engaged in some kind of bizzare porno shoot.

You see Jimmy and Tim grinning at each other. You have a flash of Evan’s sweaty face… the rest becomes a blur of phalluses thrusting towards you.

You do your best to get your teammates off, working for what seems like hours.

Just when you think events have proceeded to peek fucked-upness, Robbie steps back into the circle, [[hard cock at the ready.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1599" name="hard cock at the ready." tags="" position="1449,14098" size="100,100">“What the fuck!?” you yelp, brain reeling at the escalation of your commitment. “No way…” //He just came and he is already hard again!? What if I can’t get them off quickly enough? Is this fucking nightmare ever going to end!?// 

“Back for another round!” Robbie announces, pushing past the other guys to thrust his dick in your face. “Cup my balls,” he orders. You angrily look up at him for a moment. “Please,” he grunts.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cup.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You raise your hand and fondle Robbie’s weighty testicles.

“You feel how full those are? I only gave you a little taste before. I can tell by the look on your face you crave more of my cum. I am not leaving until I have emptied my balls inside you,” Robbie says to you in a somewhat threatening tone.

[[“Hey, Robbie, fuck off!”]] Evan interrupts.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1600" name="“Hey, Robbie, fuck off!”" tags="" position="1601,14196" size="100,100">“Whoa, everyone! Let’s calm down!” Jimmy says, attempting to mollify the sudden spark of anxiety. “Let’s not ruin the atmosphere, right?”

Your friends rumble agreement.

“I am sure that Taylor will help you out if you ask her nicely,” Jimmy predicts. “Taylor is cool. She’s obviously a very generous lady…”

For the sake of a blowjob, Robbie capitulates. “I am sorry, Taylor.  You’re just so sexy that I it is hard to keep control of myself. Please help us out!” Robbie begs. “You’re the only one who can do this for us!”

Before you can protest further, your body is covered with hands. They flick, tease, rub, and squeeze you in so many places at the same time you find yourself heating up, goaded on by an awful mix of pain and pleasure. Soon the latter eclipses the former. Your pleasure momentarily distracts you [[but it does not delay the inevitable advances of your soccer mates.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1601" name="but it does not delay the inevitable advances of your soccer mates." tags="" position="1457,14254" size="100,100">You are surrounded by a ring of petrified cocks. You feel queasy and warm as you inhale their sweaty masculine odor. The men disgust you but you find a strong appeal in being the center of attention. You have never felt so desired before in your life.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dicks.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Well…  most of these pervs have already seen me naked anyway.  I guess there is no sense fighting the inevitable….//

You feel drunk and bubbly but you still wish that you had consumed more. //Hopefully I don’t remember this...// you silently pray, sure that you will be unable to forget.

You try and pretend what is happening is just a really fucked up dream. The mental exercise helps. You soberly return to your commitment, [[doing your best to get your friends off.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1602" name="doing your best to get your friends off." tags="" position="1598,14340" size="100,100">You stick out your tongue and lick at the closest dick as the men jockey for position. “Ohhh fuck your hand feels amazing!” Jimmy groans.

Without warning, Jerry erupts all over your face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/robbiecum.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
You close your eyes until Jerry finishes. You then shift your attention to Evan in a daze.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/fpovjerk.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With your small hands cradling Evan’s manhood, you use his precum as lube and squeeze his penis as hard as you can. With minimal effort, [[you jerk off your friend to completion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1603" name="you jerk off your friend to completion." tags="" position="1456,14396" size="100,100">&quot;Holy fuck, Taylor! Aghhhhhhhhhh!&quot; Evan shouts as he shoots out a huge jet of cum that splatters all over the lower half of your face.

You rub the hot sperm all over your lips. You give the men the show they desire.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lipcum.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You begin to stroke Tim, your tiny pale hand standing in enormous contrast with his huge black dick. 

“Ahhh!  I can’t take it anymore!” Tim groans.

&quot;Me too! I am going to cum!&quot; Jimmy grunts.

The men seem to erupt in a cascading sequence, stream after stream they coat you, covering you with their seed until you can barely see. From your perspective it looks like it is raining cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/groupfacial.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Oh my god… I am covered in cum. It is like I am in a bukakke video...// Never in your wildest dreams did you ever expect to participate in one and definitely not from this point of view.

When you open your eyes, hopeful the ordeal is over, you find Robbie’s penis in front of your face.

“W-wait!  Ammpggphah…” Robbie thrusts into your open mouth, shooting a hot jet of thick cum down the back of your throat. You sputter and gag as he withdraws. You struggle to breathe and fight off the urge to be sick.  For a moment you feel, like you are literally drowning in semen.

When he withdraws you find you still have a mouth full of his spunk.

Given what has already happened, you can’t see how your actions make much difference at the moment. There are only two ways out:
[[Swallow|swallow1]]
[[Spit it all out]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1604" name="swallow1" tags="" position="1409,14546" size="100,100">Knowing from experience that the guys will appreciate it, you show off the huge load in your mouth before swallowing.

You suppress your gag reflex and feel like a slut. You’re embarrassed and ashamed but to make matters even worse, you discover that you feel //aroused.//

“That was fuckin’ awesome,” Robbie remarks. “We should make this like a regular thing… Let’s play soccer again tomorrow!”

You say nothing as [[five satisfied men look down at your cum covered face.|ralt]]

The man is so magnetically handsome that you find that you cannot resist him. His chin is perfect and his fingernails are even manicured! Wow!! &quot;You get to keep any tips the clients give you and in addition, I&#39;ll pay you $10,000 for the trip. I&#39;ll give you $5,000 now and after the work is done I&#39;ll pay you the rest.

//$10,000!? Wat the fuck! That is a lot of money! And the tips I could earn from people this rich...! I could get a better apartment on my return!// you think. The next moment Robins pull out a wad money from his jacket sets it down on the table. What do you say? Will you accept my proposal?”

&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/start/robins04.jpg&quot;&gt;

&quot;Yes, crystal clear! Wow, Mr. Robinson, thank you so much! I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re giving me an opportunity like this!&quot;

&quot;You are welcome, Taylor, I hope you enjoy every second. You must dance a lot.

You play around while shaking your hips and ass. You decide your lack of experience won’t be an issue as long as you learn a few moves.

You practice throughout the week. Thoughts of your upcoming trip excite and frighten you at the same time. 

[[On Friday night you let Julie give you a new look.]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1611" name="Finally saturday rolls around." tags="" position="14237,26958" size="100,100">Just when you have got the nightclub in your sights, you observe one of the porters at the entrance suddenly call something over the radio. As you arrive at the entrance, Robins walks out, puts his arm around your shoulders and says, &quot;Hi Taylor! You arrived just in time.&quot; 
 
You feel your heart skip a beat.  //Wow!! I like this man more and more. How can this be possible? I have been thinking about men a lot lately...// you think, biting your lip slightly. 
 
&quot;You see the Bentley over there? My personal driver, Marco, is waiting for you there. He&#39;ll be the one to take you to my plane and then for you it&#39;s off to the island! I imagine that suitcase has everything you need?”
 
“Yes I have all I need here!” you answer him.
 
“Fantastic! I hope you have a great trip. I will see you around Wednesday, I think. Until then I hope you&#39;ll do everything you can to keep the customers happy. Remember, do //everything// you can do to keep them happy. Do you understand me, Taylor? Can I place my trust in you for this?&quot; 
 
“Of course Mr. Robins! I&#39;ll do everything you expect from me; I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

The door of the car is opened by one of Robins’ personal bodyguards. You notice a pistol holstered at the man’s side. David touches your arm and you turn around. &quot;Yes, Mr. Robins?&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/driver2.jpg&quot;&gt;

&quot;By the way, I don&#39;t like my employees wearing panties. If you&#39;re not wearing any that&#39;s great, but if you are... take them off as soon as you have a chance please,” he casually informs you of the strange job requirement.
 
//What the fuck?// you think, while trying to keep your expression neutral.
 
Robins checks his watch. “I have to go. Marco will accompany you and he will be my eyes and my ears. Don&#39;t let me down!&quot; 
 
[[Get into the car…]]

Perplexed by David&#39;s last words, you head over to the huge, luxurious black Bentley. You leave your purse and your suitcase next to the driver, thank the bodyguard who is still holding the door for you and plop yourself down on the backseat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/driver3.jpg&quot;&gt;

&quot;Hello, miss, my name is Marco, I&#39;m Mr. Robins’ driver. Are you ready to depart? The ocean is lovely this time of year.&quot; 
 
[[“As ready as I can be!”]] Or [[“No! I want get out of here!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1613" name="“As ready as I can be!”" tags="" position="14238,27158" size="100,100">The journey to the airport doesn&#39;t take long. Your mind drifts back to Robins and you suddenly remember what he said about his employees and wearing panties... 
 
“Was he being serious?” you ask yourself. Fearful, you don´t hesitate to remove your own panties. You check that Marco&#39;s attention is elsewhere, before quickly slipping off your panties and stuffing them [[in your pocket.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1614" name="“No! I want get out of here!”" tags="" position="14544,27050" size="100,100">“No! I want to get out of here! I am sorry but this whole thing is a huge mistake!”

The driver says nothing.

As the doors lock you begin to feel anxious. You come to the delayed realization that you are very vulnerable in this position. Something feels very //off// about this whole scenario. Although you cannot say why, you begin to panic. //This was all a big misunderstanding… Robins might even be more dangerous than Mitch… Why did I take his money? Fuck...//

“Just drop me off anywhere…” you repeat your request to the driver. 

“Are you sure?”

“Yes.”

“As you wish,” Marco replies. You note the car is now heading away from the airport. After a couple minutes the car stops in an alley between two derelict buildings. “Robins will be very upset and he will want you to learn a hard lesson,” growls the driver.

“What’s happening!?” you shout in alarm. //I don’t want to get raped!//

The next thing you know, [[the door is ripped open and there is a fist flying at your head.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1615" name="On Friday night you let Julie give you a new look." tags="" position="14392,26848" size="100,100">You dye your hair with blonde highlights, eager for a fresh new start.

&quot;Wow, I look like a different person... This is perfect!&quot;

&quot;Just be careful, Taylor.&quot; Julie warns. &quot;Every time a guy has offered me something like this you can be sure there are strings attached.

You imagine yourself dancing like Mitch&#39;s puppet. &quot;Fuck, I really need a vacation,&quot; you reply.

[[Finally saturday rolls around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1616" name="in your pocket." tags="" position="14390,27208" size="100,100">

As you arrive at the airport, you are waved through to one of the nearby strips and looking out you can see a private Jet by the hangar, it&#39;s engines already heating up in preparation for take-off.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/jet.jpg&quot;&gt;

You realize that Marco doesn´t stop looking at your crotch through the rearview mirror and this makes you blush feeling at the same time more aroused. [[You get out]] of the car to catch the jet and you feel how a slight and subtle breeze of air sneaks through your hot pussy. “Oh my God! How come these situations arouse me so much?”

&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/driver4.jpg&quot;&gt;
You get out of the car and walk towards the plane with Marco. He seems quite friendly, this might be a good time to ask him some questions. &quot;Marco, have you known Mr. Robins a long time?&quot; You ask him as you board the plane.

&quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;ve been working for him for five years now. He&#39;s been very good to me. Once you gain his trust and that you will do as you&#39;re told, he makes sure that you never have to worry about money again. On the other hand though... well, lets just say I recommend that you make sure to do everything that is expected of you.&quot;

&quot;And what am I expected to do?&quot; you ask him.

&quot;You should already know.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on. You know what I mean,&quot; you answer vaguely, attempting to draw more info from Marco. It works.

&quot;That depends, but as I understand it you&#39;re going to replace one of our girls, Alexandra. She will be going to Europe in a couple of days, I think, I&#39;m not really sure.&quot; As the plane starts turning onto the runway for take-off, Marco goes silent. 

//Wow, this is a man of few words, not really chatty at all! It looks like I&#39;ll have to drag what I want to know out of this guy,// you think, realizing that you are starting to get a little nervous. Marco, sitting across from you, looks at you appreciatively. Your skirt is sitting a little higher than normal and you can see his gaze fix to your exposed, naked crotch. He gives a slight smile and a small sigh as he asks: &quot;Are you going to be a dancer or waitress?&quot; 

[[“I am going to be a dancer,”]] you inform him while biting your lower lip suggestively.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1618" name="“I am going to be a dancer,”" tags="" position="14386,27364" size="100,100">&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/jetflight.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Well in that case, then I pity you. Where you&#39;re going now is a bit of an extreme atmosphere. Everyone you&#39;re going to meet there is screwed up. You&#39;ll find a lot of alcohol, drugs and all manner of debauchery, perversions and fantasies present. These people have more money than you or I can dream of and they spend that money on whatever interests them at the time. When they want something, they just have to ask to receive, and if you don&#39;t give them what they ask for... well, you&#39;ll be in a lot of trouble. People like them, they don&#39;t give a shit about people like you and me.&quot;

&quot;If they are really that bad and if you hate them so much, why don&#39;t you just quit your job?&quot; //Oh my God! It looks like he seriously can&#39;t stand Robins´ clients...// you think to yourself.

&quot;For the same reason you brought that beautiful face of yours onto this plane, money! A lot of money!! Except I haven&#39;t had put my body up for sale. Not yet at least,&quot; he adds with a laugh.

&quot;I&#39;m not here to sell myself like a whore!&quot; You yell, outraged.

&quot;Look girl, all I did was give you a little advice. Do everything they tell you. That&#39;s just what&#39;s expected of you. Do you understand what I&#39;m saying? Everything!! Now then, I&#39;m going to lie down, get myself some sleep...&quot;

&quot;But Marco…&quot;you reply to him, &quot;David Robins told me that you&#39;ll explain how everything works.&quot;

&quot;Later, beautiful. We have several hours of travel, there will be plenty of time. Why don&#39;t you go to the cockpit and talk to the pilot for a while so I can sleep a little?&quot; [[Go to the cockpit…]]

&quot;Uh, excuse me, hello, how are you?&quot; you say to the attractive girl who&#39;s sitting at the plane&#39;s controls.

&quot;Marco already sent you to see me? Don&#39;t worry, he always does that when he is getting frustrated, but he is the noblest guy you will find here. I&#39;m Mailin, delighted to meet you. You are Taylor?&quot;

&quot;You... Are you the pilot?&quot; you reply in confusion.

&quot;Yes, I am. Are you surprised? I started working for Mister Robins two years ago. I met him at the club and he asked me to take a trip to Hong Kong with one of his VIP clients. The guy&#39;s name was Huang Lee- a real pervert.&quot; the girl elaborates, smiling, &quot;But thanks to that I am here now.&quot;

&quot;Wow!&quot; you answer. &quot;And what happened?&quot;

&quot;Well, just about everything... the guy was extremely into BDSM, especially the bondage part. He was a real expert with it. I was with him for two months and by the end of it I had enough money saved up to finish my studies as a pilot. I have made Mr. Robins a lot of money. I suppose that’s why he pays so well and gave me his sweet personal plane to fly.&quot;

&quot;Mailin, can you tell me something about the kind of people I&#39;m going to deal with?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea, Taylor. I only know that they are very powerful people with many caprices. If you follow them in the game you will be able to fulfill many personal dreams. At least those which need money to be fulfilled! Well, I actually personally know Goldfinger.&quot;

[[&quot;Goldfinger?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1620" name="&quot;Goldfinger?&quot;" tags="" position="14390,27520" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/mailin2.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Yeah! //Goldfinger!!!// Ha ha ha ha! It&#39;s a nickname of course.”

“Is he a James Bond fan?”

“Maybe? His real name is actually Carlo Santorini. They say that he has serious connections with the Sicilian Mafia but all I really know is that he owns a few oil wells in Saudi Arabia.&quot;

&quot;Oil wells? How is it that an Italian is the owner of oil in the Middle East?&quot; you wonder.

&quot;Good question, Taylor! Well, the story is that he won them playing poker with an Arab prince long ago. Even the Saudis are scared of Carlo!&quot; 

&quot;Wow…”  //What the fuck have I gotten myself into?//

&quot;Are you surprised?&quot; Mailin shoots you a gorgeous smile. &quot;If you are around long enough  with these people then you will know many things about them... But above all ... Just be very careful.&quot;

&quot;And why do they call him Goldfinger?&quot; you ask.

&quot;Ha, ha, ha, ha!!&quot; Mailin begins to laugh. &quot;Probably because he has so much money that he even has a gold Lamborghini!&quot;

&quot;A golden car? A Lamborghini?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!! But he earned his nickname because he usually carries a gold pistol around. By the way Taylor, never call him Goldfinger!! Call him Mr. Santorini or you&#39;ll be lost, besides he is Mr. Robins´ partner, he helps run his Western European business. He doesn&#39;t take no for an answer and likes submissive women with a nice chest, just like yours. Take my advice, you must do what he asks.&quot; You spend the next two hours chatting with Mailin about trivial things and together you start to forge a firm friendship. After this time [[you return to your seat.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1621" name="you return to your seat." tags="" position="14242,27606" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/driver5.jpg&quot;&gt;
When you head back to your seat, you see that Marco is already awake. He&#39;s looking at you strangely. &quot;Are you done already?&quot; he asks you.

&quot;Yes, I am. Have you been awake for long?&quot;

&quot;A while... Now listen, when we land at the airport on the island please try to behave yourself and be professional.&quot;

&quot;I am always professional&quot; You answer with some disdain. By the way… What is this island&#39;s name?” You don’t recall that detail ever being mentioned. 

“That shouldn&#39;t matter to you,” he brusquely replies. “You //must// behave yourself and be professional. 

“And I repeat: I am always professional!”//Or most of the time at least...//

&quot;Yeah!...I guess&quot; he answers looking you up and down again &quot;Well okay then Taylor, listen closely now because I&#39;m not going to repeat myself. When we land we will first go to Mr. Santorini&#39;s mansion. He&#39;s Mister Robins’ partner.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. David&#39;s partner?&quot; 

&quot;Always //mister Robins// to you, Taylor. Never forget it, he is now your boss. He likes to always be surrounded by beautiful women and you will very possibly have to deal with him throughout your stay on the island. Be good to him and don&#39;t ever reject him. You hear me? Never! If you do as you&#39;re supposed to, everything will be fine. When we go to the boat the crew will assign you a cabin. All your belongings, clothes and shoes will have already been placed there. They will give you a colour bracelet; it contains a reading chip with your employee code on it. This bracelet is very important. Firstly, the colour will identify you as an employee. Secondly, it will allow you to eat or drink on any part of the boat or at any private party. Do you understand?&quot; 

[[“Yes, I think so.”]] you answer him.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1622" name="“Yes, I think so.”" tags="" position="14384,27664" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/driver5.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Are there several colours of bracelets then?&quot; You foolishly ask, risking Marco’s wrath.

&quot;Yes, but the most important thing for you is the chip. Some clients will give you gifts; a bracelet, a necklace, an anklet, a ring, maybe a watch... Never take money. Do you understand? Never ever money. If you need money, you can go to any one of the security guards to exchange your gifts for money. You can also give anything you receive to the guards. They will read your employee code and keep your gifts safe until the end of the trip. These gifts will be converted into money that will be transferred to your bank account when you return at your home. Do you understand everything? It is very important that you understand.”

“Yeah! I can understand everything… “  //I&#39;m going to tempt this bastard...// you think, while slowly opening your legs.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/showpussy.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


“If you need… Ummmh… If you… Shit! If you need…” Marco loses his train of thought.

“Are you alirght?” you ask him with a smile. 

“I’m fine. I was saying that if you need drugs to keep you awake, you can go to any security guard. He will give you what you need, after reading your employee code. Anyway, I also advise you to rest whenever you are not working. All clear?” 

[[&quot;Yes, Marco! Thanks for the help.&quot;]]

&quot;Hi, you must be Taylor Roux. I am mister Santorini. Follow me, I have some questions to ask you... You three go play in the pool with the others.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mr Santorini,&quot; the girls answer with big smiles. Santorini takes you to an office and takes out a report that is, apparently, all about you and he begins to read it.

&quot;Yes, sir... as you wish,&quot; you say, remembering all the advice you were given about dealing with this man. Using your erotic dance skills, you slowly start to take off your clothes, looking him in the eyes while you sensuously caress your breasts and your waist all the way down your hips. In three minutes you are completely naked; except for your shoes.

Santorini sits in his chair without saying a thing, his gaze fixed on your body. //I&#39;ve already finished the striptease, what should I do to this guy now?// you wonder, not knowing what to do. &quot;I like your breasts,&quot; Carlo says at last.

You approach Santorini with confidence and dance for him. He smiles and nods, pleased. “I like my little whores to know who their owner is while they&#39;re here.”

//Whore… did he say whore? I am an erotic dancer… A dancer! ... but a whore…? I like sex but I&#39;m not a fuckin’ whore!” you angrily think.  //Oh shit! Ok Here I go!//

&quot;Sorry? ... We&#39;ll see.&quot; he says, reaching over to pinch your nipples &quot;Show me a little bit more now, just for me. Be a good whore and show me what your body can do.&quot; 

//Whore… did he say whore? I am an erotic dancer… A dancer! ... but a whore…? I like sex but I&#39;m not a fuckin’ whore!// you angrily think.  //Oh shit! Ok Here I go!//

You spread your legs a bit and let him see your pussy. You look directly into his eyes and you pass your tongue sensuously across your lips. For an instant it is unclear who commands the most power in the room. Combing through his beard with his finger, he watches you with interest. You continue your show…
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/a1.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/a2.jpg&quot;&gt;
You know men well. In spite of your age, Mitch has given you a lot of sexual experience… You, someone who was once a man, knows exactly how to make one rock-hard. You open your legs and bring your right hand to your pussy and gently stroke a finger across your little slit and bring it to your mouth and suck it like a mini cock. You find the situation exciting.

You feel your nipples stand up and harden. You try to take it a bit further... you see a cup filled with water and [[pick it up.]]

You sprinkle some water on your legs. The water goes down to your crotch and wets your pussy. You notice your pussy lips are inflamed by excitement; Santorini stares at the lower lips of your vulva. //Damn, I think I&#39;m getting hot!//

&quot;Show me how flexible you are!&quot; Santorini commands, speaking for the first time since you started. [[You simply obey.]]

You lift your left leg straight up without a bother; you feel your vaginal canal stretch wide open letting the air rush into your womb and making you shiver. Now you are convinced you are getting wet, wetter than you should be at any rate, but at this point you want to show more to Mr. Santorini so you [[stand up from the chair and…]]

You squat down spreading your legs. It&#39;s in this position that you feel your pussy open completely. Your nether lips are now wide open, completely exposing your vagina and revealing the pink inner petals of your blooming feminine flower. You breathe heavily as you stand up and go to the cupboard in front of you [[and slowly…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1638" name="and slowly…" tags="" position="14383,29124" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/a6.jpg&quot;&gt;
You put your back to the desk and support your elbows on it. You start to squat again, but you are so wet and horny, your hips begin to spasm and you start to hump the air as if a huge invisible cock was fucking you. You feel a vacuum in your lower abdomen and you know, by all means, that you could cum if you let it go on. //Oh my God! I am hotter than a volcanic eruption!// you think. You feel the need to go further, to find your pleasure, so you go [[back to your chair…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1639" name="back to your chair…" tags="" position="14243,29178" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/a7.jpg&quot;&gt;
You lift your left leg toward the chair and leave your pussy wide open and shining with wetness. You watch Carlo&#39;s eyes; Santorini can see it. You look at him while you finger your vulva and masturbate while eagerly rubbing your clit in front of him, the partner of your new boss. 

“Mmmmmnnn!” you moan just when your finger touches your special spot. However, suddenly Santorini&#39;s phone rings and interrupts you. He gets up and answers the call and with an authoritative gesture says, [[“Stop now slut!”]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1640" name="“Stop now slut!”" tags="" position="14387,29276" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/angry.jpg&quot;&gt;
You&#39;re completely frustrated. You feel a void inside you that is driving you crazy. And the heat... that heat around your vulva is screaming for you to turn it off with an orgasm. Santorini, meanwhile, continues talking on the phone, oblivious to your sexual plight. You bite your lip. You don&#39;t know what to do. Not really thinking, and a bit dizzy from the rush, you pick your skirt up and start dressing...

Santorini hangs up the phone and yells a question at you, &quot;Did I tell you to get dressed?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mister Santorini I just thought...&quot; 

&quot;You aren&#39;t here to THINK.&quot; He interrupts, getting angry &quot;Continue with what you were going to do. Come on, get moving slut!&quot; Yes mister Santorini, [[right away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1641" name="right away." tags="" position="14243,29326" size="100,100">You go to the couch next to the office window. You slightly raise your skirt. The heat of your belly is still there and that you have to fix it.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b1.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


As soon as you touch your pussy a strong splash of pleasure runs up your spine... Your experience catches up with you. Exhausted, you can&#39;t stay upright anymore so you decide to lie down on the couch.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You get comfortable and [[enjoy the moment.]]

You lie down and spread your legs open as wide as they can go. You breathe in deeply to relax, before sliding your finger over your clitoris. The rush of pleasure from the touch is so extreme that you can&#39;t help but moan loudly. Your pussy is absolutely shining, leaking a steady flow of juices from your pussy. //Oh my God! I can´t hold it anymore! I must rub my clit harder! Ooooh fuck!//
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b4.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You use your fingers to stroke your clit, going back and forth faster and faster as you close your eyes, already dreaming of your release as the pleasure starts culminating in your belly.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b5.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You close your eyes and you abandon all control to your desire. You rub your clitoris faster; you swallow as your desire is increasing, while your flooding vagina leaks into your asshole flooding the office with your smell of female in heat. [[You finger fuck yourself in front of Santorini.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1643" name="You finger fuck yourself in front of Santorini." tags="" position="14243,29470" size="100,100">&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b6.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You are aware of the emptiness in your vaginal canal and you feel the need to be penetrated and feel full. You open your lips and you stimulate the entrance of your pussy knowing that you are going to penetrate it with two fingers and fuck yourself hard with them.

//I… I need something in my pussy! Oh fuck!//
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/b7.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

But just as you are about to put your fingers up inside you, you open your eyes and there is Mr. Santorini standing right in front of you. With a broad smile that illuminates his face he says: &quot;Enough! I&#39;m hungry. Get up and come with me.&quot;

//Oh fuck this can&#39;t be happening to me! Fuck, I&#39;m as hot as a bitch in heat and I was almost at my orgasm! Shit! // you think. You immediately [[stop pleasuring yourself]] and follow along.

You feel terrible. You have been denied the orgasm and the sensation that you have in your whole body is of complete sexual necessity. You are encouraged by thinking that maybe Mr. Santorini wants to fuck you. He said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry...&quot; //Maybe he meant he is hungry for a woman. Well, here I am! I&#39;ll let him do anything he wants, as long as he turn off this heat that&#39;s driving me crazy! Oh my God!! I need a cock now! In my mouth, in my ass, in my pussy I don&#39;t care where but I need a cock now!// you think in frustration. Angry and aroused, [[you follow behind him]] like an obedient little bitch.

To your genuine surprise, you find that it was true that your host was hungry... but not for your body, or at least not completely... They force you to lie down on a huge table and cover your body with first-rate burgers. [[Things only escalate from there…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1646" name="Things only escalate from there…" tags="" position="14383,29728" size="100,100">
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/hungry2.jpg&quot;&gt;
The second course is worse for your excitement. They cover your whole body with Sushi while Santorini orders all his &quot;concubines&quot; to explore your body without any regard for modesty. As you try and remain still, it feels like your pussy can&#39;t take much more. You are so wet that your juices are running down your thighs.

&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/hungry3.jpg&quot;&gt;
//Oh fuck!! I can&#39;t anymore! I cannot get used to this woman&#39;s body yet! These sensations this feelings are overwhelming! No ... I can not ... Oh my God! This emptiness in my belly ... It&#39;s driving me to madness!// [[You must endure…]]

After “lunch”, your host orders you to take a shower. Then you join Santorini and four girls to drive towards direction of Island&#39;s marina. During the ride you can see why Mr. Santorini has the nickname &quot;Goldfinger&quot; … for near his crotch you can see the outline of... A 9mm gold pistol! 

Apparently, the yacht where you are going to work is 8 km from the coast, and you have to embark on a speedboat that will take you to it. Just when you think the speedboat is going to jet off, Mr. Santorini stops everything to speak with a young man wearing a very colourful shirt. It seems to you that they have a very close relationship and that he is a bit younger than you. The pair talk for at least 20 minutes. You occasionally look over at them while chatting with the other girls.

They explain to you that the young man is Santorini’s nephew. You try and distract yourself but you still feel the wetness below. As the wind rushes past your naked vagina, you can think of nothing more than masturbating as soon as you get to your cabin on the boat. Suddenly Mr. Santorini approaches you with the young man in the coloured t-shirt and says: &quot;Bitch, my nephew says he likes you and would like to get to know you a bit more intimately.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; You answer &quot;And how intimately would he like to know me?&quot;

&quot;Extremely,” Santorini replies, while his nephew looks to you with lust in his eyes. 

//Well luckily my pussy is already hot and wet!//
 
&quot;I want you to fuck him and drain his balls completely. You hear me Taylor? Leave the condom full of his sperm. Okay?” orders Santorini.

The odd request doesn’t faze you.

[[“Ok mister Santorini”]] you reply to him while feeling a light itching on the cap of your aroused clitoris.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1648" name="“Ok mister Santorini”" tags="" position="14383,29868" size="100,100">You believe in that moment that the young man is exactly the person you need to calm the furore that torments your belly. You take him by the hand and lead him back to the car. You strip completely while your male companion drops his trousers leaving his gaudy coloured shirt on. You straddle him immediately, his cock slipping up your twat with no resistance as your dripping juices and warm flesh covers his dick. You start riding him slowly at first but you quickly increase your speed, humping the young man at a wild pace. You feel the hardness of the young cock, wrapped in the latex of the condom, stretching your wet vagina. You feel the pleasure within starting to build yet again, welling at the bottom of your pussy. Your hips don&#39;t stop as your bouncing pace gets faster and you lose control.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/santorininephew2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Uhhh….”

The kid starts moaning loudly, touching your tits and grabbing at your ass-cheeks, helping you fuck yourself harder on his hard cock. Suddenly, you realize that another black car is parked right next to yours and someone is watching you from inside. You look more carefully and you realize who it is: //Marco!// You keep fucking the boy while you look at Marco through the window. The kid soon begins to groan and tremble, filling the condom with the load of cum stored in his nuts. 

“No! Don&#39;t cum yet, wait! Come on, fuck me a bit more, please!&quot; You yell at him, wanting to slow down to keep him from cumming a little longer, but just before you can reach orgasm, you feel the boy&#39;s cock deflate and lose its vigour… unable to give you the release you so desperately need. [[Oh shit!!!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1649" name="Oh shit!!!" tags="" position="14243,29926" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/santorininephew3.jpg&quot;&gt;
//Fuck this kid has left me half-done! What an asshole!// you think with annoyance. //I&#39;m hotter now than before.//

&quot;Fucking bitch! You&#39;re the hottest slut I&#39;ve ever fucked! You&#39;ve emptied my balls! What a woman!&quot; He tells you to get out the car. &quot;By the way slut, did you forget something?&quot; He says, pointing at the cum filled condom still wrapped around his cock.

&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/condomfull.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

&quot;It&#39;s up to you! Just look, it&#39;s completely full and it’s all yours. I made it just for you.&quot; [[Do you swallow?]] Or… [[No fuckin’ way!]]

You obey his instruction. You manage to pull the condom off his cock, put it to your open mouth and swallow all of his cum while “pretending” to revel in the display.

//Oh my God! I think I&#39;m turning into a semen addict....//

 &quot;Fuck, that was amazing. What a whore!&quot; he remarks. &quot;Get out of the car bitch!&quot;

[[You get out of the car…]]

You put on a face that, by itself, tells him what you think of swallowing his cum. Santorini’s nephew gets angry, takes the condom off and dumps it all over your face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/condomface.jpg&quot;&gt;
“This way you look even more like a bimbo slut ... I&#39;m a true artist!&quot; 

//Bimbo? I´m a bimbo slut? Oh my God//

“Now bitch clean yourself off and get the fuck out of my car.” 

[[You get out of the car…]]

Still naked, you leave the car, while Santorini&#39;s nephew leaves to talk with his uncle. You wipe the remains of semen from your face and lips, then clean the remains in the car. You feel completely humiliated but your desire has taken over your mind and become rooted in the depths of your being.  You still need to quench your thirst for sex. You touch your belly with your right hand feeling a void in the depths of your pussy, there at the height of where your ovaries should be placed, a void that extends throughout your vaginal canal until you reach the outside of your vulva. A vulva, your vulva, which is now swollen by your excitement, an itch of desire that makes your mind malfunction. You feel the moisture of your pussy sliding slowly under your inner thighs as your nipples become as hard as rocks. You soon fear that they will be able to cut through any fabric that covers them. At the very least, [[they are a bold and obvious sign of your arousal.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1653" name="they are a bold and obvious sign of your arousal." tags="" position="14388,30376" size="100,100">//Holy shit! Being horny as a woman has no comparison to when I was a man. This is consuming me! I am going fucking nuts! I can only think about sex!// You think biting your lower lip slightly to try to distract your dark and lustful thoughts. 

A few minute later the grinning men approach you. Their mere expressions on their faces making your clitoris twinkle all by itself. Standing naked before them makes you feel warm and dizzy.

&quot;Taylor, we&#39;ve been talking and we thought that after having seen what it just did, my poor car has become very hot as well,&quot; Mr. Santorini says, still grinning widely.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; you answer, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mr. Santorini I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say.&quot;

&quot;Cars, like people,&quot; Santorini continues, &quot;have souls, have feelings, and have... needs. I love cars, I love them more than people and I feel that my car needs to relieve some its tension.&quot;

You blink twice, unsure of how to respond. //I don’t want them to think I am an idiot but...// &quot;I am sorry but... I still don&#39;t understand, Mr. Santorini,&quot; you admit.

&quot;Damn this bimbo is stupid!&quot; remarks the nephew and they both laugh out loud. 

&quot;What I&#39;m trying to make you understand, Taylor, is that you are a whore, one of many I have here. My car needs a whore now... I want you to fuck it. Go fuck my car. //Now!//&quot; 

“Uhh…” //How does one even have sex with a car?//

//Oh my God! How is it possible that this is happening to me?// you think. //This guy is a fucking psycho, but I have to obey or I don&#39;t know what will happen to me!//

[[Refuse his request]]
[[Your best option is to do it!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1654" name="Refuse his request" tags="" position="14541,30470" size="100,100">To your surprise, they laugh at your refusal. Luckily, it doesn’t seem like a big deal. You breathe a sigh of relief.

“Ok put on your clothes! Let&#39;s take a walk now…” Santorini says without missing a beat.

//I thought for sure he would be pissed...//

You put on your clothes and follow the men to the beach. Too late, you notice Santorini gesture at you with a flicking motion. To your horror, you see that his nephew takes a knife from his pocket and before you can react properly, he plunges it deep into your stomach. You stare in disbelief at the blood covered blade and the flowing redness seeping out of you as the nephew stabs you again. He repeats the awful motion several times and you fall to the sand hugging your wounds.

The men leave you on the beach to die alone.

Even bleeding out there is no pain, only surprise, shock and confusion as the last bits of your life fade away.

“Why… did this...ha-...?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/dead.jpg&quot;&gt;
You are dead. Rest in peace.

Bad End (death)

Your eyes shine before the perverted proposition. You are very horny and you don&#39;t care what you do anymore, as long as you can have your orgasm at last. You bite your lips and... [[You return to the car with new intent.]]

You stand at the door of Santorini&#39;s car for a moment. A few steps away, you note that Marco is still watching you. Your breathing is a bit shaky as you wonder: //How the hell can I fuck a car?// Suddenly you get an idea and open the car door. You crawl over seat, heading for the car&#39;s gear shift.

&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

And you begin to pass your delicate hand by the lever stroking it the way you would stroke a cock. [[“Treat the lever like a cock, Taylor!”]] you say to yourself.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1657" name="“Treat the lever like a cock, Taylor!”" tags="" position="14247,30674" size="100,100">//Oh, Taylor! Please keep going!

&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c3.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You begin to blow the dick-shift, licking the knobby top in circles with your tongue and looking sensually at the men, who are mesmerized by your performance. You feel your vagina get wet again more and more, already dripping down the inside of your thighs.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c4.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You can&#39;t keep going like this, your arousal is so strong you can&#39;t think of anything besides fucking yourself on the dick-shift.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c5.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


Aiming to please your audience, you increase the pace of your [[blowjob.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1658" name="blowjob." tags="" position="14391,30732" size="100,100">&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c6.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your pussy is so empty... you really need something big and hard inside you. You straddle the lever and then lower yourself, letting it penetrate your pussy.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c7.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


Finally, your aching pussy is being stretched wide open. You moan loudly, rotating your hips around as you give your pussy a chance to adjust to the strange shape. You squeeze your breasts and you can&#39;t stop another moan from escaping your lips.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/c8.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your pussy slides down the length of the dick-shift, without any problem, once again your abundant juices letting your lover stand-in slide in easily. You hump it slowly at first, going down as far as you can, impaling yourself and stretching your twat wide before going back up. Up and down, down and up - faster and harder all the while. //More! More! Ummmmh Yes more!// [[More!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1659" name="More!" tags="" position="14243,30826" size="100,100">You grab the steering wheel and the seat to steady yourself, giving you leverage to fuck faster.

Your pleasure is mounting as you get the dick-shift hitting just the right spot inside you with every bounce; it hurts a bit, then it tickles, your pussy starting to twitch as the spasms take over - waves of spasms quaking through you and making you slam down harder as your muscles lose control.

“Aaaaah! Ooummmmmfff I´m cumming!” you shout while feeling the relief of your orgasm. [[Cum!]]!

You think you are going to pass-out, your eyes close, but then, as your hips hump by their own spasms, a second wave of pleasure explodes from your now well fucked cunt, draining out of you and all over the dick-shift that is now smeared in your girl-cum.

&quot;I think this time David&#39;s report was true to the letter,&quot; Santorini says, reaching down to adjust his cock through his pink trousers &quot;We certainly have a great whore on this trip. We are going to make a lot of money with you bitch... and if you behave yourself, you&#39;re going to earn a lot of cash for yourself too. Now show us that cunt of yours again.

“Fuck! If she behaves of this way now when we supply her “the Bimbo pills” we make ourselves gold!” says the nephew but you aren’t really paying full attention.

//Mmmmm at last an orgasm! Mmm What did he say? What is that? Bimbo pills? I probably heard wrong! Mmmm... Damn… that felt so good...!// 

“Come on bitch! You must get dressed and get [[on the speedboat!”]] Santorini says to you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1661" name="on the speedboat!”" tags="" position="14243,30978" size="100,100">You follow the men to a nearby pier. You come up to a huge recreational yacht. Santorini talks to the Captain for a couple of minutes while you are standing on deck, exhausted and wanting to take a shower. When they finally approach you, Santorini says, &quot;This is the new girl, Captain. Let someone from security escort her to your cabin and mark her with a purple bracelet.&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/bracelet.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Purple bracelet, sir?&quot; Asks the captain

&quot;Yes, purple&quot; answers Santorini with a huge smile &quot;and assign her a good cabin.&quot;

[[&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;]]

Yesterday was hard. You think about what happened and your whole body trembles as you remember it. Santorini scares you and you know that he is a dangerous person, very dangerous. You could never have imagined that David had a partner like that, but he has him and he&#39;s the greatest despot you&#39;ve ever known. 

//Before I leave the cabin, I&#39;d better take a shower. I wonder what awaits me today?// you wonder with apprehension.
&lt;video src=&quot;Other/trip01/day2/shower1.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


You feel relieved and full of energy when you are in the shower feeling clean and fresh. When you get out you look at the purple bracelet on your wrist ... //This color ... What does it mean? Well, whatever… Taylor, you&#39;ve come here to make money and have some fun, right? Well, work it, baby!// [[you encourage yourself.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1664" name="you encourage yourself." tags="" position="14391,31184" size="100,100">Shortly after when you leave your cabin, you run into an attractive blonde girl who wants to get inside.
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day2/alexandra1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Hi, who are you? Can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Alexandra. I guess you must be the //new one,// right?&quot;

&quot;I am Taylor. Taylor Roux. Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Curious name you have. I thought that Taylor was a boy’s name,” the woman says while checking you out from head to toe. “You’re obviously not a boy,” Alexandra concludes with a big smile.

“It is also a feminine name,” you argue and then wince. You had many times in your life made the opposite arguement. The conversation topic reminds you that you were once a man. You try not to think about it.

“Hmm. Taylor Ying Yang, the boy-girl!” she jokes. Her words hit close to home. 

//I never thought about that before. Was all this destined to happen? My name is both male and female… and here I am.// 

“No doubt you’re a woman though. You have a very nice body and very attractive female curves. I like what I see.  So, Taylor, I wanted to get into the cabin... it was mine before and I forgot to pick up something. May I get by?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; you answer and let Alexandra [[inside the room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1665" name="inside the room." tags="" position="14251,31282" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day2/alexandra2.jpg&quot;&gt;
You wait outside for a minute… Eventually, Alexandra returns with a small notebook.

&quot;Thank you so much! I use this daily and in haste I left it. So, tell me, what are you going to work here as? Ah! I see… Nevermind.!&quot; She says, looking at your purple bracelet on your wrist &quot;You are a complete girl.&quot;

&quot;//A complete girl?//&quot; you repeat the words, unsure you heard correctly.

&quot;Yes, you will dance, you will serve drinks, and you will encourage the customers.  You will have sex with them if they ask you to.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!!!???&quot; you answer terrified &quot;I&#39;m not a whore, I&#39;m a professional dancer! I am not going to have sex unless I want to. I just want to dance.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you want to call it that ... anyway, the color of the bracelet you wear will mean for VIP customers that they can request anything kind of service from you, Taylor. Do you understand? And that means having sex. In fact it is the first and most obvious thing they will ask from you aside from dancing and serving drinks.&quot;

“Fuck… I knew this place was shady.”

//Oh my God! Have they marked me like a whore? How could I have been so stupid thinking that I will only have to dance and serve drinks? These guys are like fucking gangsters too! This is not fucking good!//

Alexandra’s expression and voice softens. &quot;Oh Come on! Don&#39;t worry, if you it right you can earn a lot of money! The ship is on the way to port to pick up customers. We have time to talk for awhile. Are you coming [[to the deck?]]&quot;

You go with Alexandra to the main deck of the yacht and on your way you notice several girls wearing same purple bracelets as you, although you note that others are yellow and some are white. 

Alexandra steps into a bathroom and changes her clothes. She is now wearing a very loose green shirt.  Without a bra, her outfit it makes so her nipples poke through the fabric with any movement, contrasting her fuchsia bikini panties.

“What do the colors mean?”you ask to Alexandra.

“The colors are codes for the security and for getting the payment later. Have not they told you this already?”

“Yes, they told me something about it.” you answer remembering Marco told you.

You should never accept money from a client. If they give you anything else you must give it to a security guard that is all for you and you can exchange it for money when you finish your trip.

“Yeah I know…” -You respond. “But why the colors?”

“The yellow bracelets are for the employees who are dedicated mainly to serving drinks. They can refuse any request from a client but if the girl accepts they should tell someone from the security so they can read the code and later pay her for the services. The staff who wears purple bracelets, like you, dance with customers, have fun as they cheer them up and sometimes, they can serve drinks and also, you know ... fuck them if they ask. Oh, come on Taylor! It’s not a bad deal! Don&#39;t put that face! Surely you&#39;ll have a good time ... also if you are here in the first place I am sure that you are very open with sex, am I wrong?”

You feel enormously foolish. [[“Oh my God! I&#39;m trapped on a fucking sex boat!”]]

You and Marco talk about various boring things as you soar through the sky. Soon your eyes start getting heavy and you fall into a deep sleep. Several hours later, a sharp turn of the airplane wakes you up…
&lt;img src=&quot;Other/trip01/day1/jetlanding.jpg&quot;&gt;

“Wake up, Taylor! Look down! We’re here!&quot; From the air the island looks beautiful. The turquoise waters bathe beaches of fine white sand and small hidden coves surrounded by trees. You land in paradise and leave the plane. Marco gets behind the wheel of another high-end black car. You hop in next to him. From the back seat you can see [[the city center…]]

Sandra seems a bit surprised the house isn&#39;t a flaming crater. &quot;Everything is so clean,&quot; she remarks as she looks around. //Yeah, you were only gone a short time… What the hell was she expecting? Is Craig really messy or something?//  &quot;So, you two got along okay, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Craig seems like... a nice young man,&quot; you reply, carefully choosing your words.

&quot;You obviously have a way him. You&#39;re a very special girl, Tammy. I think I am going to need your help more often.&quot;

&quot;Craig is harmless. I am happy to help when I can.&quot;

Sandra&#39;s eyes flash at your words, reminding you a bit of a spider looking down upon a fly trapped within its web.

&quot;Can you come by tomorrow? Or is that too much to ask?&quot; Sandra gives you a pouty expression that epitomizes the word &quot;please.&quot;

&quot;After class? Sure.&quot;

&quot;You are the greatest person ever,&quot; Sandra says to you with surprising emphasis. She then presses a wad of cash into your hand. You are glad to help such a nice woman even without payment.

You thank Sandra for her generosity and depart.

&quot;I will see you tomorrow after class!&quot; you say to Sandra as you wave good-bye.

The next day, [[you return to the Bell&#39;s residence.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1673" name="you return to the Bell&#39;s residence." tags="" position="4243,10716" size="100,100">Sandra greets you at the doorway. Instead of letting you by, she embraces you tightly, so that your breasts press together against hers. You cannot help but inhale her spicy perfume, stepping back in a daze.

&quot;Tammy!! Thank you for coming!&quot; You smile at Sandra as she gathers her things. &quot;I have been meaning to catch up on my errands!&quot; she explains as she sets her purse by the door. You eye the tight black dress while trying to hide your interest. You&#39;re beginning to suspect Sandra&#39;s &quot;errands&quot; might be a cover story for something lewd.

You keep smiling, being sure not to betray your suspicions. 

&quot;Craig will be excited to see you again!&quot;

&quot;I am looking forward to playing some games too,&quot; you admit.

&quot;Go nuts. I will be back as soon as I can,&quot; Sandra says as she steps outside.

Once alone, [[you head upstairs to Craig&#39;s room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1674" name="you head upstairs to Craig&#39;s room." tags="" position="4391,10802" size="100,100">&quot;Hey, Craig!&quot;

&quot;T-Tammy! You&#39;re back!&quot;

&quot;Yep. I am looking after you again tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot; Craig raises his head, as if offering thanks to God.

You play a random assortment of video games for about an hour. Craig continuously changes the game once he reaches a moment of frustration.

&quot;I am THIIIIRSTTTYYY!&quot; Craig suddenly bellows.

You roll your eyes. &quot;Well let&#39;s get you some juice then…&quot;

&quot;The //good// juice,&quot; Craig specifies and you nod.

Another gallon of purple sugar water consumed, Craig leans back, releasing a satisfied belch.

As you rinse off the spoon you used to stir the juice, you turn towards the counter where you set your phone.

[[You notice an alert on your phone.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1675" name="&quot;I am a man!&quot; you angrily reply." tags="" position="11347,26298" size="100,100">After an awkward twenty minutes of explaining the circumstances of your condition, the doctor returns to the scan. &quot;This defect should not prevent the erosion of the uterus!&quot; he declaress, as if the revelation is significant.

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;How long have you been a woman?&quot;

&quot;Too fucking long,&quot; you answer. &quot;About two months.&quot;

&quot;You are a healthy female. There must be another explanation for your lack of menarche.&quot;

&quot;Men-march? Why do doctors try and speak in a condescending fashion? Why can&#39;t you guys just say what you mean?&quot;

&quot;Taylor, we need to do more tests to find out what is wrong with you. It is the only way we will get any answers. You aren&#39;t the only one who wants them.&quot;

After your exam, an aide leads you to a well furnished suite.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bloomsuite.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Wow, pretty swanky!&quot;

Before departing, the aide hands you a small button.

&quot;This is a comm badge. Press the center to make a request. If you get hungry or need anything, just ask. Dr. Bloom is occupied at the moment so please wait patiently for her. She shouldn&#39;t be more than a few hours,&quot; he explains.

You are left alone in your suite. You eye the giant big screen TV and wonder if Bloom gets HBO this deep underground.

[[Go explore the lab]]
[[Entertain yourself in the suite until Bloom returns]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1676" name="Go explore the lab" tags="" position="11500,26395" size="100,100">&quot;I can&#39;t just sit here with half the marvels of the universe hidden just a few doors down…&quot; There is also a small part of you that wonders what sort of secrets a wealthy genius like Bloom might possess. &quot;I bet she has an underground roller coaster!&quot;  //And maybe some technology that might help me.// You trust Bloom but not completely. Anyone with her level of wealth and power is bound to have a degree of ruthlessness to their character.  //I should be careful though… I don&#39;t want to step on her toes!//

You leave your comm badge on the table, assuming it doubles as a tracking device.

You slip out of your room. You spot an aide in the hallway but you luckily time your exit for when he is tying his shoelace. You manage to slip by with your watcher being none the wiser.

//Hmmm… I am pretty sure that guy was assigned to keep an eye on me...//

You wander through the corridors, peeking into any room with a window. You discover a room with what appears to a cadaver lying on the table. //I really hope that a robot or something...// you think with a cringe. You continue to look for more rooms with windows. 

Such rooms are rare and mostly empty or holding lab equipment that you cannot make heads or tails of. Most of the doors are locked and contain no reference to what may be hidden behind them.

That holds true until you come to one heavy plated door, unremarkable as the rest except for the awful snarling and growling noises coming from behind it.

//RRaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrghhhh!  Grraaahhhrrrr…..// You listen in horror to an awful scratching sound, [[like nails on a chalkboard multiplied a hundredfold.]]

You frantically limp away with legs that feel like jelly, grateful that the door held.

Your mind races in fear as you hobble forward. //What kind of madhouse have I entered!? I should go back to my room and pretend this never happened!// You turn a corner just in time to see two rifle toting guards step into view.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/armedguards.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;

With heart racing, you duck into a nearby corridor. Scared nearly out of your mind, you notice what you think is a security camera pointing the way you intended to escape.

//Fuuuuuuck…. If Bloom catches me like this she might think I am a spy or something...// You gulp nervously, realizing Bloom might kill you just as easily as … whatever the hell was in the room back there.

&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; asks one of the nearby guards. 

&quot;No, did you?&quot;

//Shit! They are totally going to catch me!//

You feel sweat pool in the small of your back. Your instincts urge you to fight or take flight.

[[Run!]]
[[Wait for the guards.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1679" name="Run!" tags="" position="11201,26849" size="100,100">The combination of circumstances and your frightening run-uns cause you to react rashly. You run deeper into the complex, doing your best to run underneath an overhead security camera.

&quot;Hey! Wait! Stop!&quot; you hear a voice shout after you but with two quick turns, you leave them behind.

You run until your stomach cramps. Panting, you slow to a walk as you struggle to get your bearings. //Fuck, everything looks the same!// You desperately keep moving through the underground labyrinth. Eventually you come to a different section of the laboratory. The walls have now become bare cement, appearing to mark either an older or newer section of Bloom&#39;s lab.

You suddenly realize you have a headache and feel a bit dizzy. &quot;I just can&#39;t catch a break… I don&#39;t [[feel so… great… Uhhh…]]&quot;

//I doubt I could do more than a couple push-ups the way I am now.. I obviously can&#39;t fight those armed men. But I can&#39;t just run. Where the hell could I even escape to? There is no way out of this place!//

You decide to bite the bullet and remain rooted in place.

&quot;Hey guys!&quot; you cheerfully greet the guards.

&quot;Halt!&quot; the larger of the two practically screams at you.

&quot;Whoa, there! I am halted!&quot; you shout back, raising your arms in surrender.

&quot;Who are you? What are you doing here!?&quot;

&quot;I am uh… looking for…&quot;

Your nauseousness lessens so you continue to forge ahead. As you proceed down the hallway, your hair stands on end until you feel like you have just rubbed yourself with a balloon and covered your body in static electricity. In the space of a single step, the air becomes unnaturally humid and hot. You force yourself to walk forward, choking on the harsh, thick air that seems to clog your lungs.  

At the end of the hall is a fork. There is a sign above but, for some reason, you cannot make out or comprehend the shifting symbols.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/warning.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Warrrht a fruhhhhk? Ishh thhatt Enggrish?&quot;  //Ohhh fuck… I REALLY don&#39;t feel very good...// Your dizziness and headache intensifies with every passing second. Attempting to even look at the signage gives you a staggering migraine. 

With a feeling of growing panic and an unnatural ringing in your ears, you decide to:

[[Go right]]
[[Go left]]x
[[Go back the way you came]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1682" name="Go right" tags="" position="11347,27249" size="100,100">You enter the blistering corridor on your right and your vision fades to black. You are shocked when you take a step and open your eyes twenty paces ahead.

&quot;Waarhhat thhhaaa fuuuuccckkkkkkkk?&quot; 

You feel like you are about to be torn apart.  After a few seconds of torture, you can scarcely think at all, your thoughts scattering away like a handful of seeds cast into a hurricane. You try and scream but your voice comes out in a delayed echo. For an instant, you hope you have been drugged and that you are merely in the midst of the worst acid trip ever.

That hope soon dissipates as you fall to your knees in screaming agony. Your scream splits off into fractal patterns that buzz with color and //warmth//. The world //shits// suddenly and begins to glow eerily before melting away into nothingness. As you drift in oblivion for just a fraction of a second, you finally manage a coherent thought. //This is what it must be like in the moments before someone dies. Noooo! Shiiiiiiiiiit!!

Your vision is somewhat spotty at first but it gradually returns to focus. You look around the pinkr room with confusion.  //How did I get here?//

The world seems abnormally bright and vivid. //Hopefully that is just this room&#39;s dreadful paint job...// 

&quot;Fuck, my head //really// hurts…&quot;

You step out into the hallway and stop when you notice a strange photograph on the wall.

You do a double take as your brain refuses to believe your eyes.

You recognise everyone in the picture, from your grandfather to old uncle Bill. It was taken when you were a child during a family reunion. You remember the day vividly, for it was spent playing with your cousins and consuming a crazy amount of candy.

But the picture is not completely as you remember, for next to Julie&#39;s smiling face is your own, but it is not the right face. Next to Julie, is a girl, the spitting image of her sister. You, the male you, is missing in action.

&quot;This is wrong! I have to be in the wrong house!&quot; //No, that isn&#39;t right either! A wrong house that has a picture of old uncle Bill!? Fuck me! What the fuck happened!?

&quot;Taylor, is that you?&quot; your mother&#39;s voice calls out to you.  

You instantly panic. //Uh oh… MOM!? What the fuck is she going to do when she sees me!?// How are you going to explain any of this? 

You have desperately avoided speaking to your mother since your transformation, hoping to resolve the issue as quickly as possible so as to avoid the topic entirely.

You look back towards the pink room. //Maybe I can escape out a fucking window or something...//

It is a security risk! We will take you to see Bloom.&quot; The guard turns to his colleague. &quot;Check her,&quot; orders the large man. You are frisked and then soon brought before a somewhat angry Dr. Bloom.

&quot;Caught her wandering around near the restricted wing,&quot; explains the guard.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/angrybloom.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Taylor, I hope you weren&#39;t planning to take advantage of my hospitality.&quot; Bloom glares at you and feel genuine fear.

&quot;No- I was just… exploring…&quot;

&quot;I specifically told you not to go anywhere near that area.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize I was a prisoner!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a guest and I am doing you a favor.&quot;

&quot;One which you will benefit from,&quot; you counter.

&quot;I like you, Taylor. You&#39;ve got spunk. Still, how can I be sure that you didn&#39;t see anything you shouldn&#39;t have?&quot;

&quot;I am kind of rethinking this whole arrangement,&quot; you admit.

&quot;Well you&#39;re not going anywhere until you relinquish all of your dirty little secrets to me.&quot;

&quot;W-What&#39;s going on?&quot; You look at the guards who spread out and block the exit. You feel like you are in grave danger and should chose your next words carefully...

&quot;Oh, sorry, I am … //Doctor Roux// and you hired goons can cool it. Dr. Bloom has personally tasked me with this assignment. If you hinder me in any way I will see to it you end up as a lab rat for eternity.&quot;

Your words bring silence. //I hope that threat part wasn&#39;t a bit too much.//

&quot;We apologize, Dr. Roux. Could you just show us your ID card?&quot;

&quot;You two oafs have wasted enough of my time. Good day!&quot; you say before striding off.

The guards, likely used to dealing with the demanding Dr. Bloom, let you go for fear of retribution. //I hope they don&#39;t get into too much trouble...//

&quot;Hmmm… Doctor Roux! I like the sound of that.&quot;

You continue to explore the lab while trying to circularly return to your suite. The problem is you soon become lost.

//Fuck, everything looks the same!// You desperately keep moving through the underground labyrinth. Eventually you come to a different section of the laboratory. The walls have now become bare cement, appearing to mark either an older or newer section of Bloom&#39;s lab.

You suddenly realize you have a headache and feel a bit dizzy. &quot;I just can&#39;t catch a break… I don&#39;t [[feel so… great… Uhhh…]]&quot;

Your mom smiles brightly when she sees you. &quot;Taylor! You sure took your time, sleepy head. You look pretty this morning! How&#39;s my favorite little girl?&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/marg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Your mom&#39;s words confuse you even more. //Favorite what?// Your mother gives you a warm smile before returning her attentions to the laundry she was folding as if your appearance was inconsequential.

//She doesn&#39;t find any of this a bit odd? This is either the most realistic dream ever or I have gone completely insane...//

&quot;I am fu-fine. I am fine, mom,&quot; you repeat. You always attempt to moderate your language around your mother, lest you earn a scolding.

&quot;Glad to hear it, dear. Your breakfast is getting cold,&quot; she notes.

&quot;Thanks…&quot; you reply. You walk away, mystified. //What the fuck is happening?!//

You sit down and eat breakfast. The act reminds you of shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic. //The whole fucking world has gone crazy and here I am just eating fucking cornflakes...//

You recognize your old childhood house, but it isn&#39;t //quite// as you recall. You note the living room is the wrong color and many of the items within sight seem unfamiliar. //This place is a lot … girlier,// you note. 

&quot;I guess that sort of makes sense? Ha, who in the hell am I kidding? None of this makes any god-damned sense! How in the fuck did I even get here?&quot;

You desperately try to remember the last twenty four hours and come up with nothing except scattered fragments.

//I transformed into a girl… and then...// &quot;I was visiting someone while trying to get help! Wait… That doesn&#39;t sound right either...&quot; //I am getting really freaked out here!// &quot;What the hell am I going to do now?&quot;

Everything looks exactly as it should but there is something, perhaps an unnatural energy in the air, that makes you feel like something is off.

You spot a familiar ugly mug and stop in your tracks.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stephan.jpg&quot;&gt;
//Is that fucking… Stephan!? Why the is he dressed like that?// You remember Stephen is a bit rough around the edges, yet now he is well groomed and standing before you in a suit.

For some bizarre reason, Stephan runs up to you smiling as soon as he spots you.

//What the fuck does he want? This guy is a fucking prick. He had Mitch beat me to a bloody pulp a couple of times because he thought I was mouthy. What a dick. I hate his ugly suit too, what a pretentious guy! I hope he falls down.//

&quot;What the fuck do you want, Stephen?&quot;

Stephen blinks in surprise. &quot;I just wanted to say hi is all,&quot; he sheepishly answers.

&quot;Aww, my poor baby! Come here!&quot; your mom beckons you forward. Your mother has always been a fairly loving person but you can tell by the way she speaks to you that she thinks you are a completely different person.

You sit down next to her and the two of you lie down on the bed. Your mother invades your personal space without a care, snuggling up to you like you are a stuffed animal.

//This is pretty weird but...// Being next to your mother does calm your nerves. This is a woman who has always been there for you and her presence strengthens your resolve.

After a short time, you sit up. You give your mom a big hug.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1694" name="Explore the house." tags="" position="11447,27852" size="100,100">You decide to explore your house more thoroughly.

You wander around, marveling at the subtle differences and similarities. You find several photographs with the girl that is clearly meant to be your female alter ego. On the bottom ledge of a bookshelf, you dig up a photo album.

You leaf through the pages. The other Taylor is everywhere. She is smiling brightly in nearly every picture. Another thing you notice is that the volume of photos is far beyond what you consider reasonable.

You had always been a bit camera shy, yet this Taylor clearly had no such issue. //Geez, there are so many selfies…  Are women just naturally vain or what? Or maybe it is just that good looking people are narcissistic.// There is no doubt in your mind you are far more attractive as you are now than you were in your other life.

//Other life… Fuck, everything seems like so long ago...// It genuinely bothers you that you could conceivably have been a completely different person with just one chromosome altered.

The pervasive, bad feeling that is looming in the back of your mind springs to the forefront. “What do you mean? What did we do this summer?” 

“I just mean all the movies, the walks, the dates that stuff. I thought we were like a thing. But you haven’t returned my calls lately. Are you okay?”  

//Huh!? So this guy knows me as a woman as well? Is this like some fucked up parallel dimension where I was born as a chick? Fucking, fuck! If that is true there could be countless differences. Dr. Bloom might not even exist for all I know! That&#39;s right! //DR. BLOOM!// I almost forgot… Man, I might be screwed...

You look up at Stephan; and angrily study his immensely smug features.

//Oh my god I hope I never kissed him!// Suddenly you feel sick to your stomach. Your blood runs cold. //What if I did more!?! No way...//

//If my female is half as red blooded and horny as my male side, she probably has had a healthy appetite for boys.... Nooooo! I want to leave this planet right fucking now!//

&quot;I am sorry, Stephan… I am going through some shit right now. Just let me think for a second.&quot;

Your mind races. //There must be dozens - hundreds of alterations.// After thinking a moment, you realize it is nigh on impossible to recognize and anticipate all the possible changes that could exist.

&quot;And that&#39;s if that theory is even true…?&quot;

[[&quot;What theory?&quot;]] Stephan presses you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1697" name="&quot;What theory?&quot;" tags="" position="11099,27994" size="100,100">&quot;Uhh… I have been doing lots of homework.&quot;

&quot;Just hush for a fucking second!&quot; you snap. You rub your temples to sooth your sudden onset headache.

//What other things have changed? The Taylor they see me as is obviously a completely different person...// You need a way to learn more about the person you are supposed to be in this world. Suddenly, an idea comes to you. 

//Oh! I could search my mom&#39;s place much more closely. I bet there is something to learn there. Maybe even from my mom… or her doppleganger or whatever the fuck. Hmm... I should research Taylor too, the other Taylor. I should check her- er MY computer too. I can look through the history and her favorite bookmarks.... Wait a fucking second! Where the hell is the Taylor I supposedly replaced!?// You blink rapidly. //Did she… die? Or did we swap places?// You imagine an innocent version of yourself being tortured by Doctor Bloom.

You refuse to lose the last vestiges of your modesty, held back by a tiny slice of pink fabric. A moment of silent introspection later you reconsider, realizing how silly such a sentiment is given how far things have already progressed.

You turn around on the bed and meet Craig&#39;s hungry stare. You feel compelled to [[oblige Craig&#39;s curiosity.]]

&quot;You must be Tammy? I am Mr. Bell, but you can call me Jake. Sandra already loves you, and I can&#39;t say I blame her. You are a stunning young woman, you know that?&quot;

&quot;Uh… Thanks…&quot; You feel your face heat up despite the slight chill in the room.

&quot;Aw, you&#39;re too cute. I take it Craig was well behaved?&quot;

&quot;Yeah… he&#39;s a real //peach//.&quot;

Jake Bell laughs at your tone. &quot;I see you have figured out why we pay so well, hah!&quot;

&quot;Well, since you&#39;re here, I guess my services are no longer needed,&quot; you note with a glance out the window.

&quot;I will give you a ride home,&quot; Mr. Bell insists. He sees your natural reluctance and elaborates. &quot;It is late. It wouldn&#39;t be safe, plus you save some cab fare and get to ride with a handsome gentleman like myself.&quot;

//Well, when he puts it that way...//

[[&quot;Thanks! That would be awesome!&quot;]]

You hop into Mr. Bell&#39;s Mercedes and feel a tingle vibrate through your belly as he starts the engine. It has been ages since you have been in such a nice vehicle. You can&#39;t help but grin as you zip around the city.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mercedes.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You give Mr. Bell a rough address but he decides to take the scenic route to show off his car.

You roll down the window and let the cold fall air sap away your worries until you get a chill. You roll up the window and Mr. Bell cranks up the heat while giving you a funny smile.

When he finally nears your block, Mr. Bell suddenly takes a detour. He turns off and parks in the middle of [[an empty school parking lot.]]

You become a bit alarmed when Mr. Bell shuts off the engine. You half expect him to produce a joint or a gun or something.

You are about to ask Jake why he stopped when he speaks, &quot;Why did you agree to help Sandra and I?&quot; 

You go with the obvious answer. &quot;I really need money… and I like helping people in need.&quot;

&quot;Those are both excellent reasons. I might be able to help you out with them.&quot;

&quot;I am not really sure what you mean…&quot;

&quot;I think I have a solution that will benefit us both.&quot;

You fight back a sense of panic.

Mr. Bell looks around. It is late so there is no one in sight.  

&quot;Why did we stop here?&quot; you ask him.

&quot;You&#39;re clearly a bright girl, Tammy; you&#39;re in charge of your own life. I know girls your age are eager to experiment without consequence. We both have needs. I think we can kill two birds with one stone,&quot; Mr. Bell says to you casually as he unzips his fly.  A few seconds later, you are staring in disbelief as your host jerks off his large, veiny penis.  &quot;I know it is pretty nice.  You don&#39;t have to stare… or ask permission to touch.&quot;  Mr. Bell then leans over and sets $300 on the console.

//What the fuck!? Is this actually happening!?//
[[Get out of the car]]
[[You stay seated]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1706" name="Get out of the car" tags="" position="4393,18063" size="100,100">You hop out of the car without a second thought. &quot;Later, creep!&quot; you shout at Mr. Bell as you cut through the school grounds and head home. For a second, you fear retaliation but Bell drives away after a moment.

//What a pervert! What the fuck is wrong with this family? Sandra and Sophie are cool but wow… the men in this family have some serious issues.//

//I am not a fucking whore -- Whoa!  That is a huge dick!  I mean… ahhh!//

&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; Mr. Bell agrees.  

You are mortified. &quot;Did I say that out loud?&quot;

&quot;No, hah, just the look on your face.  You haven&#39;t walked out yet and you are licking your lips…  I know a curious girl when I see one.&quot;

//I am!?  No…  Wait...//

Yet Mr. Bell&#39;s words have an element of truth to them.  Staring at Bell&#39;s dick only serves to compound the awkwardness of the situation.

&quot;You can use your hand if you want but I will only give you a third for that.&quot;

Your fingers coil around his hard cock. You give him a few soft pumps. Mr. Bell groans approvingly at your handiwork. After a minute or so, precum weeps from his tip and lubricates the motion of your hand.

&quot;Ohh…Tammy. That feels so good! I knew you were a naughty girl the second I saw you.&quot; Mr.Bell&#39;s words encourage you to hurry up. You lean over and pump his cock as quickly as you can. You are soon rewarded with a loud moan and splash of warm semen.

//Ew! Holy fuck that is a lot of cum...// You withdraw your hand and can&#39;t help but stare at the creamy fluid coating your fingers.

You lean over the console, regretting your choice with a close up view of Bell&#39;s manhood.

&quot;Uhh…&quot; The fishy smell and appearance of Bell&#39;s genitals turn you off. Before you can pull away, Mr. Bell&#39;s hand presses down on the top of your head and you are pushed down onto his engorged cock.

Your lips press against Bell&#39;s glans, giving it an inadvertent kiss. You try and brace yourself but only serve to touch the penis in front of you with your hand.

You can’t help but be a bit skeptical. “Really? You don’t feel anything //weird//? Your stomach isn’t dissolving or anything? No shooting pains?”

“I feel great!” Damien replies. “You sure you don’t want a taste?”

“Hmm…” //Fuck, I wouldn’t be surprised if this asshole did actually swap this potion out for Fresca.  Damien is a crafty devil...// You vow not to underestimate him.

“This is it, Taylor…  I am toast.  I am burnt toast!” Damien dramatically shouts, each word uttered more forcefully than the last.

“You actually look a lot better,” you note as you watch Damien’s complexion improve before your very eyes.

“Don’t just whip out your…”  You lose your train of thought when you realize Damien’s already large dick now appears even more enormous than usual.

Damien’s already huge cock continues to swell until it’s girth greatly eclipses a beer can.

“Wow…” You both comment in unison. Damien’s manhood soon approaches the largest you have ever seen or heard of. //That gigantic dick isn’t even human!//

“We might be on to something! This is way better than viagra! I feel like I could break diamonds with this meat hammer!” Damien comments excitedly.

“You definitely don’t need viagra… And don’t say stupid shit like that, it is freaking me out here!”

“Damien, I would die. Like seriously.” You imagine taking that monster inside you and nearly vomit. //That would hurt so much… ahhh it makes me queasy just looking at it.//

Damien’s mega-boner looks uncomfortable for him as well.

“I will settle for a blow job!” Damien loudly concedes.

“What the hell? I didn’t agree to anything.”

“Taylor, fucking look at me! I am going to burst! This cock is going inside you one way or another, so //decide.//”

“So I either choke or die of internal bleeding? You’re a fucking dick, man!”

The huge cock dwarfs the size of your small limbs.

“Be a good little girl and suck that for me, will ya?” Damien requests.

“...”

“Oh come on!  I was the guinea pig this time!  The least you can do is perform some CPR,”  Damien says while gesturing at his enlarged penis.

“...CPR?”

“Cardio-penile-resuscitation.”

“Fucking seriously, Damien?”  You feel exasperated.  “Oh my god… that thing is huge…” Damien’s penis invades your thoughts repeatedly. It disgusts and fascinates you at the same time.

“Come on, Taylor!  Saaave me!  Help big daddy Damien out.”

“You need serious help.”

Damien stupidly takes your words as agreement.  “Yes!  Thank you, you’re a very caring person, Taylor,” Damien says to you [[as he holds you in place while thrusting forward.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1717" name="as he holds you in place while thrusting forward." tags="" position="14617,10933" size="100,100">Damien’s smelly ultra-weiner smacks against your lips.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbigbjgrowth.jpg&quot;&gt;
The penis is too large to fit inside your tiny mouth so you just stare at it in dismay.

“Just focus on licking the head while jerking me off,” Damien advises.

“Uhhgh… Fine, you big ogre.” Your slender fingers are unable to wrap themselves around Damien’s girth. The cock looks massive in your tiny pale hands. //Fuck, I can’t believe I have to do this again...//

You fade into a now familiar routine as you do your best to pleasure Damien. You use both of your little hands to stroke your friend’s gigantic cock. The contrast of big and small gives the whole situation an extra disturbing undertone, one which Damien is either oblivious to, or more likely, endorses.

“C’mon my little baby girl… kiss it like you mean it,” he encourages you.

You take a deep breath to steady yourself but inhaling Damien’s musk has the opposite effect.

//Why am I sucking this pervert’s dick again?  How do I keep getting roped into this gross shit...?//

“Taylor, you can do better than that!  Try harder or else this big cock is going straight into that little cunny of yours.”

Damien&#39;s words genuinely frighten you. //No way! I thought I would die even without that potion… If this enlarged cock fucks me I won’t survive!//  Damien’s threat does wonders for your motivation.

You momentarily set aside your feelings of disgust and shame.  You stroke, lick, suck, and kiss Damien until his groans fill the entire room.

As you look up at Damien, his cock erupts in your mouth, coating your throat with warm jizz. With nowhere to go, [[you choke down all you can]] before pulling back, coughing and sputtering. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1718" name="you choke down all you can" tags="" position="14470,10980" size="100,100">You look up at Damien as his overflowing sperm spills from your lips.

“That was fuckin’ hot! Wow, that was a perfect appetizer. Now on to the main course! Taylor, let’s get it onnn!”

“No way....  I //just// got you off. I did that so I wouldnt have to...”

“That obviously wasn’t enough. Look at how swollen my cock still is. It yearns to be inside you.”

“Your fleeting pleasure is worth less than my life!” you argue.

Damien bites his lip, clearly coming to a slightly different determination.

“I’m sorry, Taylor, but// I need// to do this…”

“Do whaa--- AHH!” [[you screech as Damien pushes you over.]]

“I just need to hide them from Damien…” You find yourself a decent spot hidden behind the drain of a bathroom sink. “Perfect.”

“Mmm… That smells pretty good,” you say as you take a seat at Damien’s table.

Damien grins at you. He seems to be in fine spirits. “So you survived?”

“I feel great actually. Woke up feeling like a million bucks! I think we are on to something here.”

“But I am still like this…”

“Well… to be honest I am scared that if you transform again I will lose my cute little girl… Odds are we will get something worse since you are already in your ultimate form.”

“Shut up, Damien! I am sick of being trapped in this house too. What about Julie? Are there search parties out looking for me?”

“As far as I know, no one has noticed your disappearance aside from the hospital and the suits.”

“No way… Evan and Drew had to have noticed my absence!”

“Oh those dweebs? Maybe, yeah.”

//Shit, I need to get word out. I don’t really feel comfortable approaching them like this though… Damn, can I really rely on Damien to do the right thing?//

“Would you mind letting everyone know I am alive? Discreetly?”

“Oh, no problemo! Discretion is my middle name!”

“Thanks…”

Damien sits down at the table and sets a huge BLT sandwich in front of you.

You eat half the sandwich and feel stuffed. Your meal together is eerily quiet. Damien stares at you intently for several minutes.

“Are you okay?” you ask him. //I hope he didnt get brain damage... or more brain damage...//

“Huh? Yeah… I’m fine. No, actually I am great! Taylor, I have something I want to show you.”

“Sure. It’s nothing shady I hope…”

You follow Damien upstairs into his room.

“What did you want--?” you are interrupted as Damien embraces you, while kicking the door closed. “DAMIEN! What are you doing!?” you yelp as [[you fall along with Damien onto his bed.]]

“What the hell, man?”

“What’s the problem, Taylor? I know you’re just as horny as I am.”

“T-That’s not true! Ahhh!” you protest as Damien reorients himself into a sitting position and pulls you onto his lap.

Damien’s boner presses into your behind. You attempt to escape but Damien holds you firmly in place. He gently guides your hand to his his penis and forces you to feel its girthy outline

“I want you to touch it,” Damien says as he twists you by the hips until you are face to face with a large erection separating you. Damien pulls your panties aside and points his phallus directly at your tiny pussy.

//Noooo! I have to stop this!// Seeing only one alternative to penetration, you attempt to take the initiative, grabbing Damien before he can enter you and jerking him off like a madwoman. Soon he is grunting and panting and your dainty hand and stomach is covered in his cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hjd.gif&quot;&gt;
“I was so close…” [[Damien gasps with disappointment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1725" name="Damien gasps with disappointment." tags="" position="14622,11734" size="100,100">You hold up your hand and inspect your handiwork. Damien’s sticky white cum drips from your slender fingers, the majority of his load pooling in your palm.

//Ew… Why does this keep happening to me?//

Part of you is disgusted but another is undeniably aroused. You cannot determine whether it is the smell, or the visual cues or something else but your mind begins to numb, giving way to the pleasures of the moment.  //He came so much for me…// You don’t know if you should be proud or ashamed.

Suddenly Damien’s large, slightly calloused hand envelopes your own and and pushes your fingers to your mouth. After the moment of shock recedes, both hands fall away, leaving your mouth covered in Damien’s pungent seed.

//At least this is over now...// you think for a second but those expectations are instantly dashed as Damien sits up.

You stare in amazement as Damien’s erection rises to attention, standing tall and proud, nearly blocking out the light from your position underneath him. //No way...// You just stare at his member is disbelief. It seems even bigger and more intimidating than you remember, although still well below the absurd size caused by the potion he ingested the previous day.

Damien notices your dismay but instead of comforting you he only grins down at you as he rubs [[his leaking cock against your pussy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1726" name="his leaking cock against your pussy." tags="" position="14476,11801" size="100,100">As Damien’s huge cock brushes against your tiny slit, you feel every possible alarm go off in your mind. With Damien in la-la land you can do nothing except brace yourself and bite your lip as Damien penetrates you with a spear of hot male flesh.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienfuck.jpg&quot;&gt;
“Nooo…” you whimper as Damien’s cock fills you to your limit and more. You ball your fists and cry out but Damien doesn’t stop. You feel your belly swell with Damien’s manhood as Damien slides in. It hurts so much that you can do nothing except mewl in terror. Your body appears to be expanding, but perhaps that is only a feeling a disbelief at watching something so large go inside you.

You begin to pant.  You stare off into space, unable to focus on anything except the strange sensations happening below… //inside// you. //Agghh… Why?! Damien is treating me like a sex doll… I am having sex with Damien!// You try unsuccessfully to imagine anything except what is happening internally.

Damien fucks your little pussy until lewd smells and sounds fill the room.

“You love daddy’s cock, don’t you, Taylor?” Damien mumbles as he kisses your neck while stuffing you with cock. 

You choose not to respond. With no way to escape or fight back, you resolve to endure.

[[Sensing your surrender, Damien takes full advantage of the situation.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1727" name="Sensing your surrender, Damien takes full advantage of the situation." tags="" position="14622,11859" size="100,100">The next hour is a blur of strange sensations. After a painfully brutal fucking, you completely switch off your mind. You just follow Damien’s coaxing, directed as if in a daze.

Eventually Damien lies down on his back and beckons you forward.

You straddle Damien’s cock and slowly lower yourself, guiding his manhood inside.  //Ughh!  It hurts!  I am losing my virginity for the like third time in my life… fuck…. This is the worst!// Yet, the sensations aren’t all bad… This experience is by far the most painful but fortunately… or unfortunately, the scales quickly shift from pain to pleasure. After a bit of soft riding, you find that the //hurt// feels //good// if you move in just the right manner.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/damienlilvirgin.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A wave of tingling warmth rushes over your body as your convulsing pussy and legs finally calm.  

Such a huge cock is now inside your tiny body. Your pussy grips Damien tightly out of necessity as he penetrates so deeply inside you that you fear you will genuinely hurt yourself.

//Almost.//  “Uhhhhhhhhh!  Oh my god!  Your huge dick is… aaahhh…. Hnnnnghh…  I am being torn apart!  Owwww…..”  //I knew this would be painful but holy shit… ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!//

With each powerful thrust, that pain lessens until you can almost bear it.

Insteading of showing you mercy, your words cause Damien’s cock to swell to its maximum size. You whimper as Damien proceeds to ravish your tight little body.

The strange rocking motions continue until Damien’s plunging cock brings you to a reluctant orgasm. You convulse on top of Damien until you feel like you have lost your mind.

Damien gives you a few more half hearted thrusts before he withdraws from you and lies back on the bed with a blissful sigh, his glistening manhood deflating.  You look down at your pussy and watch dumbfounded as a line of Damien’s milky semen flows out of you. You can feel the strange sensation of him still inside you and the warmth of his ejaculate coating your insides.

Now that you have once again had sex with Damien, your greatest fear is that this will [[become a daily occurence.]]

Once Mr. Bell&#39;s car is out of sight, you suddenly feel sick to your stomach. //I just gave a handjob for money… fuck, I feel like such a … prostitute.// You think about your time with Craig and seriously doubt your own decision making.

&quot;What the hell has happened to me?&quot; Your transformation is relatively minor as long as you are in charge of your own faculties. //Why can&#39;t I just say no?// You scratch your cheek and get a whiff of Bell&#39;s pungent odor from your fingers.

You have a sudden epiphany. //I should just act like I enjoy it...//

Pretending to savour the taste, you take most of Bell&#39;s penis inside your mouth. You imagine Bell&#39;s flesh is a lollipop but the illusion is hard to maintain.

&quot;Ogh… Oghh… Gahh!&quot; you can&#39;t help but make lewd noises as you service Bell.

//Faahh… Aghh… Why am I sucking a smelly cock?// You had once considered your dignity to be invaluable but now you have sold a piece of it for a small stack of bills.

Your run your lips and tongue over his swollen member until your mind is foggy and your lips are sodden with salty gloss.

With your sensual display, Bell reaches his limit. With no other warning but Bell&#39;s bucking hips, [[your mouth fills with semen as he ejaculates.]]

You liberally wash the dildo and stash it back in Julie’s room.

“Alright! Time to crack the gender bending mystery!” you declare as you sit down at your PC. After watching three hours of very strange anime, you flop over in frustration. Although your life right now does feel a bit like a cartoon, you doubt such fiction will hold the key to returning to your former life.

You return to the search engine and browse through results, alternating between various keywords. You end up with a short list of mostly hopeless ideas.

“Hey Taylor! I got your lab results!” Evan greets you. He pushes forward an envelope.

You open it up and scan through the results. You see nothing that stands out to your untrained eye.

“Uhh…”

“I already had the nurse look at it. Congratulations, Taylor! You’re a healthy girl! Nothing stands out.”

“No way! There is nothing off in the results?” //How is that even possible?//

“Nope, I even double checked against some blind results. If I mixed your page in with some other women in their mid twenties I wouldn’t be able to pick it out.”

“Well, fuck!” You throw up your hands in exasperation.

“Hey! At least you have a clean bill of health, right?”

“Well that’s something,” you grudgingly admit. “What did you come up with?” you ask your friends, hopeful for an escape. You do your best to sound optimistic but your own lack of progress has admittedly weakened your resolve.

He just completed a large research grant and published a paper on… //spontaneous sexual reassignment.// And what a surprise, he works downtown. I figured it is an odd enough coincidence that he can either help or maybe he is even involved somehow…”

“Wow, that sounds encouraging! Who is this expert?”

Evan shrugs. “Typical boring nerd. I forget his name already- Zeker or some shit- but he works in a lab; wears a white coat. He seems like a pretty odd guy. Even for a nerd.” Evan glances at Drew as if the two have obvious overlapping traits.

“What do you mean?”

“He seems to have a wee bit of paranoia.”

“Paranoia?”

“Yeah, this scientist is never seen without a bodyguard,” replies Evan.

[[“Why does he have a bodyguard?”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1746" name="“Why does he have a bodyguard?”" tags="" position="309,9894" size="100,100">“Maybe we should ask him!” Evan says with a laugh. He takes a crumpled post-it note from his pocket. “There’s the name and address.”

“Cool. What are the chances we can get him to talk to us?”

“Uhh…” Evan breaks eye contact in embarrassment. “Probably not great. I watched a clip of him on vidtube, the guy is like a poster child for anti-psychotic meds. I don’t think he will be easy to talk to if we even get close enough to do so...// but //I am sure this is probably one of the only people on the planet that might be able to help you out.”

“Great… At least that’s something. I do appreciate it. Evan, you can be a dick sometimes but you are a good guy.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1747" name="Sit with Evan" tags="" position="703,10294" size="100,100">Since Evan is directly behind you, you offer him the inside seat. 

“Don’t mind if I do…” Evan says as he sits. He smiles at you as you sit beside him.

After about a minute, Evan begins to tickle your leg.

“What are you doing?”

“I am just teasing you,” Evan answers as if his answer is obvious. “You’ve got really nice legs,” he adds.

“Please don’t touch me,” you reply in a firm voice.

Evan sighs but luckily leaves you alone.

The ride is fairly quick and uneventful. The route doesn’t go directly to your destination so you are [[forced to walk a couple blocks to the office complex that houses Dr. Zeke’s lab.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1748" name="Sit with Drew" tags="" position="409,10286" size="100,100">You turn to Drew and gesture at the open seats. With a look of relief he quickly sits down in the inside seat and you take the isle.

Evan says nothing, content to gaze out the window. Part way through the trip, you realize that your knee is touching Drew’s. Your next thought is how unladylike you must appear with your open legs. //I guess that is okay though since I am not a lady...// Still, you notice a few unusual sidelong glances from other riders.

The ride is fairly quick and uneventful. The route doesn’t go directly to your destination so you are [[forced to walk a couple blocks to the office complex that houses Dr. Zeke’s lab.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1749" name="Stand" tags="" position="555,10346" size="100,100">You decide to remain standing. Evan and Drew seem unwilling to sit next to each other, so they also take standing positions on your flanks.

The ride is fairly quick and uneventful although you do get jostled into your friends a couple times as the bus stops and starts. The route doesn’t go directly to your destination so you are [[forced to walk a couple blocks to the office complex that houses Dr. Zeke’s lab.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/camera.png&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You and your friends exchange a worried glance as you look over the oddly fortified office building. Security cameras cover every vantage.  You spot at least two security guards patrolling the perimeter.

“What the hell kind of place is this?” you wonder.

“These kind of labs are very expensive to equip, staff, and operate,” Drew explains. “Security is a necessity even if they are just researching  the properties of tomato paste.”

“Well, I guess there is only one obvious place to start…”

[[Try the front door]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1751" name="Try the front door" tags="" position="705,10590" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lobby.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You enter the lobby. The high ceilings make you feel small. [[A peppy secretary greets you at the central desk.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1752" name="A peppy secretary greets you at the central desk." tags="" position="553,10692" size="100,100">“Hello! Do you have an appointment?” she asks you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sec.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uh…&quot; You glance at Evan’s post-it note. “Could we book one? We would like to speak to Dr. Zeke.”

The secretary frowns. “Dr. Zeke does not take appointments.”

“We really need to speak to him. It is urgent,” you insist.

“I am sorry. Dr. Zeke is one of the exceptions. He does not take appointments or do interviews.” You notice a distinct change in tone when the young woman mentions the doctor.

“May I talk to him on the phone?”

The secretary sighs. “No.” She sighs. “I know it is inconvenient…”

“Oh come on! It&#39;s super important. We have info he would definitely like to have. You won’t get in trouble, trust me.”

“It is explicitly forbidden. Any requests for Dr. Zeke must go through our board of directors,” explains the secretary. It seems she has done this many times before.

“How long will that take!?”

“They meet quarterly and they just had a meeting so… three months or so?”

“I can’t wait that long! [[I need to speak to Dr. Zeke as soon as possible!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1753" name="I need to speak to Dr. Zeke as soon as possible!" tags="" position="701,10746" size="100,100">The secretary taps her lips thoughtfully and inclines her head towards you. “Just between us girls,” she whispers, “He is kind of a creep. Zeke rarely talks to anyone outside of colleagues. I think he views us //normal folk// as not worth his time.”

You notice the receptionist seems oddly receptive to your inquiries. //Maybe she likes chicks?// You lean forward and press your advantage. “So what, he’s just like a ghost and no one can talk to him? He sounds kind of like a dick!”

“Oh people try and talk to him sometimes. They usually only make that mistake once. He eats lunch in the courtyard and sometimes I just want to throw a pie at him or something. He will just sit out there for hours sometimes scribbling in his notebook.”

//Jackpot!// “Thank you for your help!”

“This is perfect!” Evan says with a laugh once you are back outside.

“What do you mean? We still have to break in!” Drew protests. He looks quite distraught at the prospect of breaking //any// rules let alone actual break and entering.

“But only into the courtyard!” you answer. “I am sure if we get to speak to him, he will be interested. I am like a walking experiment, no egghead will be able to resist my allure!” you boast with exaggerated ego.

Your bravado pays off. After a deep breath, Drew nods.

[[Sneak into the courtyard]]
[[Try and devise a more novel solution]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1754" name="Sneak into the courtyard" tags="" position="554,10852" size="100,100">You enter one of the neighbouring buildings to get a better view of your surroundings. You see the courtyard hidden in one corner of the office’s ground floor.

It looks like you might be able to enter the courtyard if you gain access to one of the adjacent rooftops.

//That’s right, these buildings always have ladders and roof hatches for maintenance staff...//

One of the ladders looks a little bit dangerous even from this distance but you are confident that if you can make to the roof you will get to the Doctor.

“I think this will work…” You briefly outline your plan. Evan approves while Drew vibrates with anxiety.

You enter the building next to the lab. Just as you are about to walk up to the front desk, Evan grabs your hand and points to a nearby door.

You read the door’s placard and grin at Evan. “Good idea,” you say as you step into the [[maintenance room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1755" name="Try and devise a more novel solution" tags="" position="848,10800" size="100,100">Novel solutions are for wussies. EoC</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1756" name="maintenance room." tags="" position="698,10898" size="100,100">
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/maint.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Inside are several grimy pairs of coveralls. You pick out the smallest suit and begin to get dressed. Evan follows your lead while Drew watches in disbelief.

“What are you guys doing?”

“Putting on our disguises,” you answer. The coveralls billow around you but luckily don’t look completely absurd.

Once dressed, your &quot;maintenance team&quot; makes its debut at the front desk.

“Hey, we got a call one of your units has no heat,” you smoothly lie to the receptionist. With a dismissive glance at your coveralls, the woman hands you a key without issue and wishes you good luck.

As you walk away with your friends you struggle to contain your laughter.

You find the roof access on the seventh floor and climb the ladder to the roof.

Your impromptu spy mission is a tad thrilling. Once you step onto the rooftop, you feel like a secret agent. All the stars seem to line up for you.

“There he is! That’s got to be him!” You point to a man sitting alone surrounded by a large buffer of empty tables.

Evan squints in the direction you pointed. “I can’t tell. Kinda looks like him I guess.”

“What should we do?” asks Drew.

“We can’t stay up here forever,” Evan adds.

[[“Let’s go meet the doctor!”]]
[[“Let’s observe for a bit before we act.”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1757" name="“Let’s go meet the doctor!”" tags="" position="555,11000" size="100,100">You feel a little jolt as adrenaline begins to surge through your body.

“Follow me!” you shout as you head to an emergency access ladder that drops down near the courtyard.

Despite the constantly vibrating metal of the ladder, you make it safely to the bottom. Evan follows after you, while Drew descends very slowly while taking up the rear.

Once all three of you are together again, you peek from around the corner and scope out your surroundings. The scientist who you believe to be Dr. Zeke is sitting about a hundred paces away.

“We will probably only get one shot at this, so let’s make it count… Um...” You look at Evan and Drew, in their mismatched and ill fitting overalls. They don’t look intimidating but they do stand out. //Maybe I should ask them to stay? But three should be better than one...//

[[Approach together with your friends]]
[[Approach alone]]x

//I have to satisfy this beast before it is too late… Fuck, fuck, fuck!  What do I do?//

Damien repositions himself in front of your tingling vulva while an exploring finger invades your wet crevice.

You look at the giant penis about to penetrate you and despair.

“Wait!” Your mind reels in panic, desperately trying to engineer a way out of this situation. “Please!  Please, //daddy!// Uh…”

Just as the massive cock is pressing against you, Damien suddenly jerks backwards and sprawls out on the bed in a sudden stupor. His manhood visibly deflates in a second.

//Oh thank fuck!// You scramble to grab your clothes and escape before Damien wakes up. As you are about to leave, you look at the nearby potion that triggered Damien’s sudden transformation.

You decide that the most sensible thing is to...
[[Destroy the potion]]
[[Keep the components for later]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1760" name="their own faces no doubt mirroring your own panic." tags="" position="555,11142" size="100,100">“FUCK! We have to get out of here!” you yell at your friends. You run back the way you came, heading back in the direction of the ladder.

As you reach the corner, a security guard blocks your path.

“AHH!” you yelp, barely managing to dodge out of the way of a grasping arm. 

“Taylor! Behind you!” Evan’s warning reaches your ears just in time. You duck and see a portly security guard sail through the air above you.

You pick a random direction and flee with your friends a few steps behind.

You avoid any entrances into the office and finally spot a small chance of escape, noticing that one of the courtyard walls is slightly lower than its neighbours.

“There!” you screech. “We need to get up there!” you point and shout. You look over your shoulder and see the two guards catching up to you.

Drew looks apprehensively up at the wall in a state of pure disbelief. It is as if you just requested that he sprout wings. You grit your teeth. You suspect both you and Drew will have a lot of difficulty climbing the wall but for very different reasons.

You near the wall with pursuit hot on your tail. You fight off a feeling of despair as you come face to face with the wall blocking your path.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wall.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fuck!” you curse as you look to a panicked Evan and Drew. The wall looks much more difficult to climb up close.

“Hurry!” Evan shouts at you. He clearly is waiting for you to make some kind of decision.

You know your next actions are critical if you hope to escape in time.

[[Try to scramble up the wall]]

//That’s right! I am the lightest!// “Me first!” 

You elbow Evan out of the way and leap onto the wall. As soon as your fingers touch concrete, you realize your task is much harder than it first appeared. With the grace of a tree frog, you cling to the wall but struggle to climb. Every inch you climb seems to be a herculean task. You plainly lack the upper body strength to easily lift yourself upwards. You attempt to go full spider mode and cling to the tiny holes in the wall but you quickly find your grip strength to be exhausted.

As the seconds tick on, you feel the embarrassment of defeat wash over you. “Nooo….”

You fall on your ass with a //thud// just as a squadron of armed security guards block off your retreat.

//Fuuuuuuuuuuccccccccck….//
[[You have been captured by laboratory security.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1762" name="Encourage Evan to climb up first" tags="" position="703,11200" size="100,100">You frantically come up with a plan. “Evan, you first, then you can pull me up and we can pull Drew up together!” you bark out orders like a feminine drill sergeant. Evan appears doubtful after hearing your plan but does not object.

With sneakers pressed firmly into the rebar holes for footholds, Evan begins to climb.

You watch Evan climb in slow motion. Just when you think he has firmly conquered the obstacle, he slips and nearly falls to the ground, managing to steady himself at the last instant. 

[[Help Evan]]
[[Ask Drew to help Evan]] x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1763" name="Use Drew as a step ladder" tags="" position="305,11192" size="100,100">Drew looks sturdy, right?

Luckily, your efforts have a greater effect than you expect. You manage to buy Evan the precious seconds he needs to hook his toe into the next hold.

With a grunt and a few quick moves, Evan pulls himself over the top of the wall.

You get a running start and jump as high as you are able. One of your nails starts to bleed as you claw your way up. You realize you aren’t moving fast enough. You look back at Drew, fearing to leave him behind. 

Suddenly you feel your body shift as Evan grabs your forearm and lifts you to the top of the wall as if you were weightless.

“Come on Drew!” you yell down at Drew.

Drew looks at you and then back at the guards that are about to reach his position.

For an instant, you fear Drew will break. Instead he springs after you and begins to climb the wall.

Drew sticks to the wall like a giant gummy bear.

“Holy fuck, Drew…” Evan grunts as he strains to pull Drew’s significant wait upward.

You join your strength with Evan’s and pull with all your might until you fear your wimpy girl arms will pop from their sockets.

Drew smiles with relief.  He seems amazed that he made it over the wall.

“Dude. Diet. Now!” Evan brusquely admonishes Drew.

“We don’t have time for this! Let’s get the fuck out of here!” 

[[You retreat back to your house to reassess.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1766" name="Ask Drew to help Evan" tags="" position="849,11346" size="100,100">EoC</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1767" name="You retreat back to your house to reassess." tags="" position="695,11452" size="100,100">Once safely inside your house, you breathe a sigh of relief. “Wow… We almost fucking died!” You blurt out your feelings.

Evan nods his head in agreement. “Yep. Way to go, Taylor. You almost got us killed.”

Having the blame directed at you makes you bristle. “Me? Going out there was your damned idea!”

Evan’s face flashes with anger. “It was your decision!” he counters.

“I guess… I am sorry!” You apologize and slump over, head in hands. “What are we going to do now?” you wonder.

“You still want our help?” asks Evan.

“Of course! I need you guys! I can’t do this by myself. I don’t want to be stuck like this forever!”

Evan shoots you a hopeful smile. “Well that might not be the worst fate ever…” 

You notice Evan overtly ogles your new figure. You turn away in disgust, only to note that [[Drew is giving you much the same look, although he is a bit better at hiding it.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1768" name="Drew is giving you much the same look, although he is a bit better at hiding it." tags="" position="550,11498" size="100,100">“You guys are creeping me out. Why are you looking at me like that?” You can’t help but feel a rising level of tension in the room.

Drew snaps out of his daze and has the grace to look embarrassed.

Evan snaps his fingers. “Oh! I just remembered something! I will be right back.” He runs outside to his car before returning with white box. “I got you a present!” Evan announces.

“A present?”

“To celebrate girlhood!”

You open the box and stare in disbelief at its contents.

Evan laughs hard when he sees your shocked expression.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cleardildo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Dude! What the fuck? Why would you buy me something like this?” you wonder. Of course you don’t mention the fact that you have already experimented with something similar.

Evan looks offended. “What do you mean? I thought I was doing you a favor! All I wanted to do was help out my sexually frustrated friend!”

Evan’s words roll over you. You hold up the dildo in disbelief and it wiggles in your hand. You find that you just have no words to express yourself. When you look at Drew you have an urge to laugh, [[instead you look away with burning cheeks.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1769" name="instead you look away with burning cheeks." tags="" position="698,11600" size="100,100">“What’s wrong, Taylor?” Evan teases you. “If you want we could always try with flesh instead of plastic,” Evan offers.

“//Flesh?//” You flush with embarrassment as Evan’s meaning sinks in. “Ah… Gross…”

“It is natural,” Evan insists.

“I am a guy! Why are you even thinking about shit like that?” You imagine your circumstances being reversed with Evan in your place. //Even if Evan transformed into a supermodel you seriously doubt that you would find him attractive.//

“Oh come on, you have got to be curious about your new body!” Evan smoothly transitions to a new argument.

“That’s none of your business!” you reply as you turn away in an effort to hide your embarrassment.

“Well it kind of is. You asked us for help. Then we nearly died… When we helped you move you gave us a case of beer. This is so much more dangerous and I am yet to see any incentive…”

“I thought we were friends!”

“Exactly! We are //friends,// Taylor!” Evan agrees, as if making a profound point.

“I will pay you guys back…” you assure them.

“How about we do some more “[[research?]]’’” Evan suggests.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1770" name="research?" tags="" position="550,11646" size="100,100">Every fine hair on your body stands on its end. “I don’t think I like where this is going…”

“Oh, don’t be such a prude. Where’s the Taylor that laughed himself hoarse over our discussion on //lasercocks?//

“Err… What are you getting at?”

“I am just saying it might be very motivating and appreciated if you… //show off your boobs a little bit,//” Evan finishes the sentence with a whisper.

You balk. “Huh!? What?! Are you an idiot?”

“Oh come on. Don’t just hoard those breasts for yourself!” Evan exclaims. You notice his forehead is glistening with sweat.

“Hoard… my breasts… ? That doesn’t even make any sense...”

“What about Drew!?” Evan demands.

You look at Drew who has been quietly listening to your argument with Evan. He seems to be cloaked in aura of introversion.

“I bet Drew has never even seen a real pair of boobs,” Evan predicts.

“T-That’s not true!” Drew finally joins the conversation.

[[“The internet doesn’t count!”]] Evan snaps.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1771" name="“The internet doesn’t count!”" tags="" position="698,11760" size="100,100">“Oh…”

Evan smirks at Drew. “Alright, I think I figured out a great solution. Taylor, you have a very easy way to, ahem, //motivate// us, or //thank us// - if you really have the desire.” Evan then makes large grasping motions with his palms pointed to his chest, in an attempt to imitate large breasts.

As you look back and forth between your two closest friends, you begin to feel even more uncomfortable. The dangerous events of the day make you feel guilty. You don’t want to be stuck in this foreign body but your friends getting hurt seems like an even worse outcome.

“You want to see my chest? A //man’s// chest?” you clarify.

“Taylor, you might be a man upstairs… but //downstairs?//” Evan glances at Drew. “//We// want to see your tits. Right, Drew?”

Evan’s attempt to rally support from Drew surprises you almost as much as his odd request.

Drew blinks furiously for a moment. “I, uh, umm…” Drew’s eyes flit around the room, attempting to look anywhere except at your chest.

“Wow, you guys are both hopeless,” you say as you stand up and stretch. 

Evan moves over to Drew and whispers in his ear. 

The next one to speak is Drew. He swallows nervously and then says, “If you want to show us, I promise I won’t say anything.”

“What!? Not you too, Drew…” //Is Evan’s perversion contagious or something!?// “Are you guys kidding?”

“Nope. As a former man, you should know the motivational power of boobs! They are one of the mysterious powers of the universe,” attests Evan.

After a moment of thoughtful consideration, [[Drew nods in agreement.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1772" name="Drew nods in agreement." tags="" position="555,11798" size="100,100">//These guys are un-be-fucking-lievable.// Still, they are your closest friends and they have done a lot for you. //Oh man, I can’t believe I am even considering this...//

“Fine, whatever! You guys have seen me shirtless before anyway…” //Just not like this...//

The faces of your friends light up. You feel like you’ve just taunted a puppy with a walk or a treat.

//I guess I have to do something… Fuck, I can’t believe I am doing this… It feels so wrong...//

While silently wondering if you are making the correct decision, you pull off your shirt and bare your perky breasts for the viewing pleasure of your best friends.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/imageboob.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The room becomes deathly quiet. Evan and Drew stare wide-eyed at your chest. They both seem shocked that you actually complied with their lewd request.

You decide to give them thirty more seconds. Yet, by the time you reach your count, all three of you are transfixed.

“Those are the nicest boobs I have ever seen,” opines Evan with a soft whistle. “Not the biggest, but… wow… They are so perky! Even your nipples are cute!” Evan awkwardly begins to describe your boobs in painful detail.

At the mention of your nipples, they begin to engorge and harden. //Uh oh... I hope they can&#39;t see that...//

Drew seems to have been knocked from reality. He resembles a fish, opening and closing his mouth while mumbling to himself. Both Evan and Drew are now breathing harder by the second.

//Ahh… yeah, this was a bad idea...// “Alright, pervs! That’s enough!” you announce as you cover yourself.

“That was only like a few seconds!” Evan protests.

Evan’s attitude pisses you off. “What the hell?”

“Well it just seems like such a minor thing. There’s nothing wrong with airing those out… To be honest, you’re the one who is clearly stressed.”

“I won’t argue with that…”

Evan makes an exaggerated moan as he rubs his shoulder as he received a sudden jolt of pain. “Ow… shit, this is going to be sore tomorrow. Fucking nearly tore my arm off rescuing you guys…”

Evan’s unsubtle attempt to guilt you into pushing your boundaries annoys you immensely. Despite this, it works. Besides, it is very easy for you to relate to Evan’s frustrations. You just wish he wouldn’t try and take them out on you.

“Can you rub it for me, Taylor?” Evan requests.

“Uh, no. I’d rather not touch you. You’re kind of gross and sweaty, no offense.”

“Don’t you think that we have earned a //reward?//”

Evan’s tone makes you cautious. “What kind of reward? I guess I do owe you guys dinner or something…”

Evan shoots you a dopey smile. “//Dinner?// We had guns pointed at us and you want to buy us dinner...”

You bow your head. “Uh, I am //really// grateful…”

“I am glad to hear it! I have a WAY better and cheaper way to show your gratitude… he he HE!”

[[“Evan, you fucking creep!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1774" name="“Evan, you fucking creep!”" tags="" position="551,11950" size="100,100">“Surely you have experimented a bit?” Evan continues, lost in his own world. “I bet you masturbate all the time now. I don’t blame you. I would too.”

“How about you just do your thing and Drew and I will watch.”

“Dude! That is so fucking wrong. Do you even hear what you’re saying? You want me to m-masturbate for you!?”

“It isn’t for me! It is for all of us! We all benefit. You know, Drew and I both risked our lives for you. Drew’s a perma-virgin, you’re stressed, and I love a good show. Win-win- //win!//”

Evan’s ridiculous arguments overload your capacity to resist.

“I don’t know if I can do this…”

“Just pretend we aren’t here.”

Both Drew and Evan nod reverently. For a second, they almost look like they are //praying// to you.

“I guess I can’t let you boys down… Alright, fuck, whatever…. Goddess Taylor will give you both a show. This is it though… And I never want to hear another word about this //ever,// got it?”

The boys continue their enthusiastic nodding.

With a heavy heart, you begin to strip in front of your friends.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorgoddesssmirk.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
When you are finally naked before them, you can’t help but smirk at their comically dumbfounded reactions.

You have never seen anyone look at you with such intensity, and now there are two pairs of eyes staring at you with the same look. “Have you guys never seen a … woman before?”

“Not like you,” Drew replies in a whisper.

“Not like you,” Evan agrees.

As the eyes of your best friends devour your young body, [[you lie down one of the spare beds in your basement.]]

You open your legs for Drew and Evan, spreading the fleshy petals of your pussy apart. You rub your mons and gently caress the outlines of your vagina.

Within moments, all three of you are breathing loudly enough for it to be noticeable. This ratchets up your awkwardness, but you keep persisting until your sex is slick and all eyes in the room are focused in the same place.

//Fuck, it is so embarrassing to be watched while I am doing this… but why….? Why do I feel so weird…?//

The tension building within you is not due to embarrassment.

“Uh… Uhhh…. UHH…. OH!”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taylormast2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your exploring fingers probe deeper and you slowly begin to feel greater pleasure. Stroking your clit while your friends eagerly watch on, you feel horribly conflicted, like a forbidden sexy star.

You keep rolling your fingers over your moistening folds until you feel an orgasm, once distant, now appear within sight.

“Oh yeah! Rub that little pussy!” Evan mumbles from the sideline. 

You want to stop but your body does not obey your rational mind. Your fingers schlick deeper inside your vaginal slit with every pass. You have a desire for something more substantial. Your love canal feels strangely //empty.//
[[Keep going...]]

//Oh… I just came in front of my friends! Ugh... // You are mortified; embarrassed but also undeniably aroused.

Your orgasm does nothing for stress relief. All you can think of is attaining another one. You don’t really care about your friends anymore, you just want more of the energizing sensation that you get from touching yourself.

//Thump.//

As if in answer to your silent yearning, Evan throws the dildo he brought onto the bed beside you.

You bite your lip and stare at it for the count of ten.

The next thing you know, you are holding the horrid thing in your hand… and //pointing it at yourself.// 

You shiver and jump as the cold plastic touches the warmth of your aching pussy.

“Oh, no, no, no…” //This is sooo bad… What has gotten into me?//

Egged on by the eager stares of your friends, you work the stiff object inside you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/frustmast.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhh!” you moan inadvertently as you control the penetration, seeking //something// deep inside you.

The plastic cock fills you up and it feels fucking awesome.

You grip the dildo as you once would have your cock. You fuck yourself with the fake penis until you find yourself wondering what a real one might feel like. That disturbing thought is the last one you have before you finally cum.

“Ahhhhhh Fwaaannnn Aghhh!” Your legs shake spastically as your orgasm sets off a chain reaction in your body.

“That was amazing… You could make a fortune online,” Evan says to you.

“Err…” You dress in breathy silence, conscious of the dampness coating your thighs and sex.

“If you need anything… from either of us,” Evan adds with a sidelong glance at Drew. “Just let us know…” 

“You’re going?”

Evan licks his lips. “Yeah… I have to home //right now.//” 

&quot;Me too,&quot; says Drew.

Evan and Drew leave your house with shocking haste, each with an awkward gait.

You do your best not to imagine [[their likely actions once arriving home.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1780" name="Approach together with your friends" tags="" position="705,11050" size="100,100">“Let’s split up and converge on him. If you get close enough, all you have to say is we have proof his newest theory is anything but…”

“Alright, Taylor! Let’s do this!” Evan agrees.

Drew gives you a wild-eyed look. “Are you sure about this?”

“Yep. Even if we get caught, I doubt they can do very much to us.” You and your friends ditch your overalls. 

With one last deep breath, you step out from cover and walk towards your destination. Evan and Drew fan out to either side.

Dr. Zeke has his head down as he writes in a notebook. You close half the distance between him, with each step accelerating your heartbeat and further fraying your nerves.  Just as you close into shouting distance, Dr. Zeke sits up. His eyes immediately snap to you and then to your friends approaching from either side.

There is a split second of confusion on Zeke’s face before panic sets in. He tears himself from the table and begins to scramble away.

//Fuck!// Your instinct is to give chase and that only causes Dr. Zeke to run even faster. You are astounded at the Doctor’s speed. He leaps a table and into the cafeteria before you get a chance to speak to him.

“WAIT! I transformed into a girl and I need your help!” you scream after him. It takes a second for the insanity of your words to sink in. You watch the Doctor reach a security guard inside the building.

You look at Evan and Drew, [[their own faces no doubt mirroring your own panic.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1781" name="Approach alone" tags="" position="407,11053" size="100,100">Bold moves for bold outcomes.

You blink and snap back to reality. &quot;Huh? What?&quot;

&quot;You were like spaced out,&quot; observes Stephan.

&quot;It has just been a really stressful day, alright?&quot;

“Okay… How about I help you &quot;decompress?&quot; I got some beer and some kickass weed. You should come over and we could hangout,” Stephan offers.

“Sorry, I have some things to do right now,&quot; you answer distractedly. Stephan’s grin evaporates, replaced with an irritated tick reminding you much more of the usual Stephan from your own memories. 

Still, you are a bit shocked at Stephan’s response when he practically kneels before you. “I enjoyed every second of our time together this summer. You are my dream girl; smart, funny, and beautiful. You’re perfect, Taylor. I love you!” Stephan pauses for a second before adding, &quot;And I thought it was mutual. I don&#39;t know why you are being so cold.&quot;

You are stunned. //What the hell can I say to that?//

Without another word, [[Stephan stands and embraces you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1783" name="Stephan stands and embraces you." tags="" position="11099,28134" size="100,100">He stares into your eyes for a moment and looks over your pouty, sensuous lips before planting his atop yours. You freeze solid. You want to fight back but find that you are paralyzed by the suddenness and shocking nature  of Stephan&#39;s advance. 

Your lips part for a moment and you take the opportunity to push the young man away. “I have to go, Stephan.”

“Aww… Okay. Will you come by tonight after your mom goes to bed?” he asks you. His eyes are calm, intent and serious. You can clearly identify an odd longing contained within them. Stephan&#39;s boldness makes you cautious. “Um. Maybe, but I have to go right now. Bye!” 

Stephan kisses you once more on the cheek and releases you from his near bear-hug like grip. He smiles warmly at you. “I will see you tonight, Taylor! I will be waiting for you.” He stands there grinning and waving like an idiot while you retreat towards your doppelganger&#39;s house.

[[Search the house.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1784" name="Search the house." tags="" position="11251,28240" size="100,100">You return &quot;home&quot; and return to your pink room.

You search the closet first. You find what you were dreading: it&#39;s filled with woman&#39;s clothing.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/closet.jpg&quot;&gt;
There are shoes stacked open shoes and strange boot-like items everywhere.

You go through the clothes in attempt to glean some sort of detail about Taylor&#39;s taste.

As you glance around the pink room you grimace. //This is not good...// The only non pink surface in the room is covered with shitty movie posters with obnoxious male leads. 

Many of the outfits in the wardrobe are conservative but you soon notice a common theme: Taylor, whoever she is, clearly wasn&#39;t afraid to show skin.

&quot;Is that a //cheerleaders uniform? //&quot;

You step away from the closet, unwilling to go further for fear of what you will find.

//What&#39;s next, the giant cache of sex toys!?//

You flop onto the bed and attempt to mentally digest the events of the day. The act leaves you with an instant headache.

//That damn stupid idiot Stephan. Why in the fuck did he have to kiss me? Why did any of this fucking shit have to happen to me? How in the fuck did I get here?//

After what feels like ages, you check the clock again and are disturbed that only fifteen minutes had passed since last you peeked. 

You find yourself staring at the window. //An easy escape route...// 

&quot;Ah fuck it, I’ll go get drunk on Stephan&#39;s dime. This place gives me the creeps.&quot; 

You grab a yellow hoodie out of your closet and then climb out of the window.

You walk through the dark streets alone. Your surroundings remind you of an easier portion of your life. //Everything is so familiar but strange...//

As you approach Stephan&#39;s house, you hear loud music long before you see the property.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; you wonder.

[[You walk up to the backyard and see a small gathering of people.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1786" name="You walk up to the backyard and see a small gathering of people." tags="" position="11247,28392" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bband.jpg&quot;&gt;
On a nearby stage made mostly of boxes, you spot Stephan singing at the head of a garage band. 

They sing about nonsense, with a clear focus on humorous lyrics.

You close your eyes and just listen. For the first time since arriving in this strange place, you forget about your plight.

After singing about the victory of a kangaroo boxing champion, Stephan hops off the stage and rushes over to you.

&quot;Do you do that often?&quot; you ask him.

Stephan raises an eyebrow. &quot;Of course. Especially since I know you like these songs. Heck, you know I wrote half of them for you.&quot;

&quot;Um.&quot; //This was such a bad idea… Why did I come here anyway?//

[[&quot;Beer?&quot;]] Stephan offers.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1787" name="&quot;Beer?&quot;" tags="" position="11099,28434" size="100,100">//Oh yeah, that&#39;s why I came here. I will just have a beer or two and then blow Stephan off.//

Four beers later, you find yourself immersed in a story about the kangaroo that inspired one of Stephan&#39;s songs.

&quot;Then he punched him right in the fuckin&#39; face. And that was when we knew we had ourselves a contender… I said, &quot;put some gloves on this guy, and he will go pro.&quot; I am kind of surprised you don&#39;t remember this.&quot;

&quot;Sorry I am… drunk.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Becoming a lightweight?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

Despite Stephan normally being a huge prick, you actually enjoy your conversation with him.

You have another beer and a few more laughs. You finally feel less scared and alone.

//Oh, wow. I needed this. I am sick of having my life ripped apart.// It felt good to laugh. 

You go to use the washroom but upon your return you begin to feel dizzy. You sit down and a moment later [[Stephan sits beside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1788" name="Stephan sits beside you." tags="" position="11251,28544" size="100,100">His hand intertwines your own. &quot;I-&quot; is all you manage to say before Stephan kisses you. He covers your lips and cheeks in a dizzying barrage of kisses.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stephkiss.jpg&quot;&gt;
You are left with a tingling in your legs. You are glad that you are sitting down.

You try and tell Stephan to stop but he just keeps kissing you and doesn&#39;t allow you a moment to speak.

After a hundred kisses, your resistance lessens. You don&#39;t kiss him back but you don&#39;t //quite// shy away as much with each pass. You slip into a daze as your internal protests fade to a muted roar, [[like dull background noise.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1789" name="like dull background noise." tags="" position="11099,28590" size="100,100">When Stephan finally releases you, you move to step away but, with a firm hand, he gently guides you back to the house.

&quot;You just do //THINGS// to me, ya know? I just look at you and get this feeling... it’s almost a pain. It is like a //yearning.// I think about how beautiful you are and I just....”

As you look over at Stephan, your eyes fall on the very large and very obvious erection straining to break free from his jeans. Stephan reaches over and grabs your hand, placing it on his crotch.

“You did this to me,” he whispers with a pained voice.

The alcohol combined with all the hormones racing through your body destroy your inhibitions.  Even though you know it is wrong, you begin rubbing Stephen&#39;s bulge. As your fingers trace his girth it becomes apparent that Stephan is clearly a well endowed man. 

Without warning, Stephan’s hand slips into your panties and begins rubbing your mound. 

&quot;Ohh, you&#39;re nice and excited already. [[That&#39;s my girl]],&quot; he praises you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1790" name="That&#39;s my girl" tags="" position="11247,28692" size="100,100">Stephan moves his attentions lower, teasing the sensitive flesh around your clit while he watches your expressions with amusement. A finger ventures inside you for a moment, finding your feminine parts to be shamefully flooded with love juice. For a moment, you feel wild and sexy. //Why am I suddenly so horny?// The thought vanishes as Stephan renews his assault. //Are those lewd noises coming from me?// You take a deep breath, conscious that you feel yourself slipping away, replaced with only the sensations emanating from the place where you are now joined.  

Stephan plays you like an instrument, his deft fingers coaxing you into a lather. 

The pressure builds inside you. Your tingling skin feels like it is on fire. You moan loudly as Stephan manipulates you to move closer.  You grip your pant leg as you exceed your pleasure limit. Your body rocks and flops around in Stephan&#39;s arms as he continues to massage you until every aftershock recedes. 

You have never experienced anything similar before. Your personal alone time and the moments with Drew are incomparable.

You lie shivering with a thin layer of sweat covering your flushed body. Stephan just laughs, surveying his handiwork, no doubt etching the image in his sick mind.

As a man an orgasm was normally the end and cue for sleep. As a woman your first orgasm [[leaves you feeling even more aroused.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1791" name="leaves you feeling even more aroused." tags="" position="11099,28742" size="100,100">//Fuck… we are alone.

You know it will be difficult to stop now with such an amazing discovery and such a small taste of something great.

Your orgasm and drunken horniness makes you prone to spontaneous action. You crawl closer to Stephan. 

//Why the hell am I doing this?// you wonder as your small hand rubs Stephan&#39;s bulge. //Obviously some part of me wants… wants to do this… That can&#39;t be right!//

You begin to unzip Stephan, your hands moving tortuously slow down his groin.

With a thundering heart, you draw Stephan&#39;s boxer fly apart and dislodge his huge penis. 

//Holy fucking shit that is a big dick...//

You knew he would be large, but seeing it in the flesh is truly shocking. 

//He is easily twice I used to be. Fuck, why am I thinking about that!?//

Intrigued, you wrap both of your tiny hands around it, giving it a few soft pumps.

Even with both of your hands on his dick, there is still space above your fingers. //This thing is fucking huge...// If one of your fingers seemed a tight fit in your pussy, there was no way this //monster// would ever fit.

&quot;Taylor, you know when you told me that you loved sucking my dick, well that was one of the best moments of my life.&quot;

It takes a while for Stephan&#39;s words to sink in.

//I said that? What kind of person do they think I am?// You realize you are in this situation because of your own decisions, as fucked up as that chain of events may seem. Your chaotic thoughts finally beg the question, &quot;what kind of person am I right now?&quot;

You bite your lip, eyeing Stephan&#39;s erection while processing through a host of conflicting thoughts.
[[Commit to sucking Stephan&#39;s dick.]]

You grip his hard cock and then lower your mouth over his glans.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/steph1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ohhh… I missed you so much, Taylor.&quot;

Stephan made you orgasm, so you figure that you are merely returning the favor. Even though it is a bit stinky and more than a little gross, you kiss Stephan&#39;s penis and roll your tongue over the sensitive crown of his manhood.

You perform felatio on Stephan for several minutes until he finally grabs your head and holds you in place.

&quot;Oh shit, I am going to cum! Open up, babe! Here it comes!&quot; Stephan announces.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stephcum.gif&quot;&gt;

Steph blows his massive load all over your tongue, forcing you to taste his bitter seed. Once he is finished, you slump back with a mouth full of cum and a mind full of regret.

You attempt to preempt any weirdness. //I have to be crystal clear.// &quot;Craig, I am not doing //anything// sexual with you.&quot; You feel like a bit of a hypocrite given your state of undress. &quot;How about I stay in my underwear while we play games.

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Okay then…&quot; //Bullet dodged? Now I am just an awkward night away from freedom!//

&quot;Okay… How about: we play another game and if I win, I get a kiss,&quot; Craig innocently suggests.

You flop down on a sofa between several boxes and start to think over your day. &quot;One of the weirdest things about being back in this house is that it //burned down three years ago,//&quot; you remark, eyeing the unremarkable but obviously unburnt ceiling above you. The wood has turned orange with age so it is clear that this structure has never been rebuilt. //Because it never burned down…?// The idea really weirds you out and gives you a headache.

&quot;That&#39;s not even in the top five reasons why this is so strange,&quot; replies a nasal voice.

&quot;Eh!?&quot; You jump up in fright, having been certain you were alone. You scan the basement but see nothing except junk. &quot;Who&#39;s there!?&quot; you shout. You raise your tiny fists defensively, ready to fight off demonic invaders or aliens or whatever you may encounter.

You listen for a few seconds, hearing only a very soft rattling sound that you cannot place.

Finally the voice breaks the silence, &quot;Taylor, I need you to calm down,&quot; it patiently begins. &quot;Take ten deep breaths. Look nearby. I am on the wall below the clock.&quot;

&quot;No more than the average human,&quot; answers the moth. &quot;If you refuse to help me without suitable interrogation, then please continue and waste no more of our time!&quot;

&quot;Uh… Can… like all animals talk?&quot;

&quot;Only the smart ones. I can&#39;t believe that was your first real question.&quot;

You mentally latch onto the word //real.// &quot;Are you… real? Is this all the most elaborate prank ever?&quot; You briefly consider capturing the moth and using it to make a fortune as a gimmick but you dismiss the idea. //What if this thing is my spirit animal or some shit? Or maybe it is a hallucination and I will just chase it out into traffic… Oh well, I guess it is nice to have someone to talk to in the midst of this insane dream.//

&quot;Alright, what&#39;s your name, moth?&quot;

The moth flies over to you and perches on a straw from a discarded fast food beverage. &quot;I am called … the //GALAMOTH!//&quot; the moth grandly introduces himself with an elaborate flourish of his antennae, opening his wings to reveal two strange colorations that look vaguely like eyes.

You are awed by the weirdness of the situation. Just when things can&#39;t possibly get more fucked up, they do. //They always fucking do...// 

You can think of no way forward but politeness. &quot;Okay… Uh… [[Nice to meet you, Mister Moth]]...&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1800" name="Nice to meet you, Mister Moth" tags="" position="11447,28302" size="100,100">&quot;Nice to meet you too, Mr. Roux. Now follow me!&quot; Galamoth says as he takes flight, his meandering path through the air heading upstairs.

You have your choice robbed from you. //How can I not follow that thing!?// &quot;Where are we going?&quot; you ask the moth once outside.

&quot;Why the Lepidopterist Guild of course!&quot; Galamoth replies as if his answer is obvious.

&quot;The Lepi what- guild? How are they going to help?&quot;

&quot;Knowledge is the solution to all our problems,&quot; insists Galamoth.

&quot;What is a lepi-dop...terrorist?&quot;

Galamoth sighs. &quot;A //lepidopterist// studies butterflies and moths,&quot; he patiently explains.

&quot;Oh, I have seen butterfly collections in museums! Those were kind of cool...&quot;

Galamoth makes a disdainful sniffing noise. &quot;Butterflies get all the glamour,&quot; he complains. 

&quot;Well moths do look a bit //drab…//&quot; you note.

&quot;No one ever goes to see the moths…&quot; laments Galamoth. &quot;We get put in a dusty storage room to be eaten by other, ahem, //fresher// moths.&quot;

You try to be sympathetic. &quot;That sounds awful…&quot; Your voice drops off as you pass near several people out for a walk.

[[&quot;Some species are very colorful!&quot;]] Galamoth adds.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1801" name="&quot;Some species are very colorful!&quot;" tags="" position="11603,28360" size="100,100">&quot;I am sure they are…&quot;

It is a bit hard to tell, but you are pretty sure Galamoth just gave you an angry look. &quot;Hmmpf. We can&#39;t all transform into a beautiful woman,&quot; he mutters.

&quot;Is that what happened to you? Did you… //transform// into a moth? Is that even possible?&quot;

&quot;Um! Uhh… It is hard to explain,&quot; Galamoth evasively answers.

You raise an eyebrow. &quot;It is a yes or no question…&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t think we have time to get into this now. I don&#39;t want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. This world doesn&#39;t even have Tim Hortons. It sucks.&quot;

&quot;Are you a Canadian moth?&quot;

&quot;I am an international moth with disntinguished taste!&quot;

&quot;This is way too weird. I want to know what&#39;s going on and who … or what I am partnering with. Are you Doctor Bloom&#39;s agent?&quot;

Your suggestion makes Galamoth vibrate with anger. &quot;//Bloom!//&quot; Galamoth practically spits the name. &quot;It is all Bloom&#39;s fault! She is insane! She meddles with things she should not! Like, //ahem//, a moth to the flame, she is attracted to unusual technology. No doubt this is why she has taken an interest in you. This is why we need to work together, Taylor! We have both been wronged by that big breasted harlot!&quot; Galamoth&#39;s abrupt rant fades into silence.

&quot;Okay…&quot; It doesn&#39;t seem like you are going to get more out of the moth on that topic. You ask the next obvious question on your mind. &quot;How do you know so much about me?&quot;

&quot;Hm. I promise I will tell you everything once we get out of here safely. We need more action, less talk or we might be stuck here forever! Time is of the essence! I need your help!&quot;

&quot;Of course you do…&quot; //Everything and everyone in this world is fucking crazy… This moth-thing clearly knows a lot more about this place than I do… What should I do? Clearly I need some antipsychotic meds or a fly swatter or something...//

&quot;What!? That&#39;s absurdly prejudiced! Taylor, I never took you for a racist!&quot;

&quot;Hey, fuck off! I have to trust my instincts! It is the only thing I have in this mad, fucked up world.&quot;

&quot;Um… You&#39;re not exactly helping your case with the insane rant. What&#39;s next? Are you going to talk about taking over the world?&quot;

&quot;Of course not!&quot; the moth replies.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s good at least.&quot;

&quot;I want to //destroy// this world, not take it over,&quot; Galamoth casually informs you.

Galamoth nods his tiny head. &quot;I am glad you are so accomidati--What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;

&quot;Goodbye you abomination!&quot; you shout as your open palm eclipses Galamoth.

&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; The tiny voice suddenly cuts off.

Once Galamoth is squished (and your hand is clean), you feel a lot better. 

&quot;I actually feel a bit less insane, that&#39;s gotta be good right? Oh fuck, I am talking to myself….&quot;

She is a woman of means, intelligence, and power.  She is the daughter of a shipping magnate.  Dr. Bloom was afforded every advantage and, unlike most in her position, she squandered very little if any of her potential and used her advantages to accelerate her growth and sharpen an already sharp razor-wit into a force to be reckoned with.  According to her wiki entry, Dr. Bloom now heads one of the leading nanotechnology development firms, within a giant consortium of other commercial and scientific interests that spans the globe.  But Fantasia&#39;s firm has a troubling reputation.  There are also rumors of strange experiments being conducted on corporate property.

You suspect he and your mom might be having some troubles, possibly due to your father&#39;s traveling schedule and frequent absences.

You feel like you need a very cold shower to snap yourself back to reality. &quot;Well… that was pretty fuckin&#39; weird… I am definitely never telling anyone about this. I don&#39;t want people to think I belong in the looney bin.&quot;

//But can I really let that genocidal insect just fly off? Maybe I should call the police…//

“Maybe I could have that table? If it’s alright of course,” you say, pointing to one small table in full view of your target.

“That table is reserved for an important guest…” The boy looks doubtful for a moment but after a bit of open mouth gaping, he finally nods. “It might work…”

“Aww, thank you! You’re the best!”

Your pre-emptive thank you knocks over the last of the boy’s resistance. “I-uh- … Okay. I will get you in but you have to be quick,” he relents.

“You are my savior!”

The boy beams at your praise as he leads you to your table. You order an iced tea and an appetizer platter of bite size spinach and cheese pastries.

//Okay… I am here, now what?// You begin to formulate a plan and are startled when your meal arrives in front of you about a minute later.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/appet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I put a rush on it,” the same young man from earlier says as he sets down your plate.

“Oh, thank you! That’s very thoughtful. These look fu-really good!” You awkwardly attempt to moderate your language.

You eat one of the appetizers and are blown away by the flavor. Before you know it, you [[scarf down the whole plate.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1845" name="scarf down the whole plate." tags="" position="8878,11601" size="100,100">“That was sooo tasty!” You drain half your iced tea and barely resist the urge to belch.

//Oh shit, I am not here to stuff my face! I need to get Ferret’s phone! Alright, game on!// 

You let Lucas catch you staring at him. You find it an easy act to look away in embarrassment. A few seconds later, you shyly peek back. Your eyes meet Lucas’ and, for a moment, your mind goes blank. //I’ve got his attention… Uh… Now what!?//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/coy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You playfully touch your hair, running the soft brown strands through your fingertips. You pout your lips, conscious of an almost imperceptible shift in the air. You seem to captivate and control the attention of the entire room. Everyone seems to be looking at you but you focus your attention on one man.

//Come to me, Mr. Ferret… Come to me!//

To your surprise, your mental command seems to work. As if by magic, Mr. Ferret stands abruptly, bumping his leg awkwardly on the table as he rises. [[The immaculate businessman appears flustered as he approaches you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1846" name="The immaculate businessman appears flustered as he approaches you." tags="" position="9022,11647" size="100,100">Mr. Ferret swallows before speaking. “My name is Lucas. I must say you are an absolutely stunning woman. You also have excellent taste. Those spinach things are //heavenly// but such words are best used to describe beauties like yourself.”

The compliments make you queasy. At least events appear to be moving in the right direction.

“I need to know your name,” Lucas presses you.

“It is … Tracey.”

“It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. May I sit?” 

You nod gracefully. “You may.”

The businessman sits at your table. You watch with interest as Lucas sways slightly in his chair. He abandons breathing through his nose and begins sucking in air through his mouth. The older gentlemen is noticeably out of breath. [[You begin to wonder how many cocktails he had with his meal.]]

“I couldn&#39;t agree more! I have a permanent suite at the La Grand Hotel.”

“That’s forward!”

“I apologize. You just… draw something out of me,” Lucas replies after a moment. “You haven’t thrown a drink in my face yet. Can I take that to mean you are interested?”

“Um…”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1848" name="Give him the cold shoulder and arrange a future meeting." tags="" position="8727,11905" size="100,100">You withdraw your hand.

“I am afraid I have to go,” you inform him.

Lucas frowns but nods. “Before you go I need to know if I can see you again.”

“If I am in the mood,” you reply.

Lucas takes out a business card from his wallet. He rewrites the tiny phone number listed on the card in bold cursive. 

He then passes you the card.

//I bet I can get him to pay for my lunch...// “It was nice meeting you, Mr. Ferret. I need to find my waiter and pay…”

“Nonsense! It is on me,” Lucas interrupts you.

“That’s very generous, thank you. I’ll call you. //Maybe//,” you tease him as you withdraw.

Lucas [[smiles sadly and waves you off.]]

“Up close you’re even more beautiful,” he says to you. Lucas licks his dry lips. “Your perfume is… quite… intoxicating too…” he remarks.

//My what!? Uh oh… // A bunch of Deter’s insane ramblings flash through your mind. //Maybe if I just hang around this guy long enough I can find a way to snatch his phone...// You realize you will have to walk a fine line between encouraging him just enough to manipulate into a precarious position while avoiding a groping.

“Uh, thanks… I am glad you like it…” You subtly point your head in the executive’s direction.

“Honestly, you’re the most //alluring// woman I have ever seen…” Ferret pants as his hand advances across the table and covers your own.

You want to recoil from Ferret but you know you must make a convincing show if you hope to pull off your scheme.

Evan suggestively brandishes the fox tail at you.

“Stop that!” you shout in alarm. “Put that gross thing away.” The mere appearance of the unusual item reminds you of its function… and previous location.

Evan laughs at your distress. “I can’t! It’s too funny!” Evan lunges forward and pokes you in the arm with the plug end. You glower at him. “Oh come on! You know you want it,” Evan presses you.

“Why would you think that?” 

Evan rolls his eyes and gives you a wry smile. “You have a great butt,” he answers without missing a beat.

“So what?! [[That doesn’t give you the right to be a huge pervert,]]” you argue.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1852" name="That doesn’t give you the right to be a huge pervert," tags="" position="2546,21680" size="100,100">Evan doesn’t appear to be listening. You notice his gaze appears to be transfixed on your backside. “Mmmmm…. I would love to pound that tight little ass of yours…” he murmurs.

“Nooo!” You begin to edge away from Evan.

“Okay, how about this then…” Evan’s words drift off as he rummages around in a backpack. He then tosses you a clear plastic box.

“What’s this!?”

“A dildo!”

“//A dildo…?//” you repeat the words in disbelief. “Evan, I don’t know what to say to you sometimes… I guess it is way better than what we have been doing...”

“Whoooa! Hold on! It isn’t a replacement for me, merely a minor supplement. Using it is just a little harmless fun! So you can practice. I know you&#39;re wary of putting big anything up there. I thought maybe this could help until you are ready to try the real thing.”

“Aghhh… //until I am ready for the real thing!?// I have already given you too much freedom, Evan. My butt is off-fucking limits!”

Evan rolls his eyes. He seems unperturbed. [[“Says the chick who wore a tail anal plug all night to a party,”]] he remarks.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1853" name="“Says the chick who wore a tail anal plug all night to a party,”" tags="" position="2692,21730" size="100,100">You wince at the uncomfortable reminder. Your ass cheeks clench inadvertently. “It was part of the costume,” you answer, conscious of how lame your defense sounds.

“Uh huh…” You hear a vibrating noise. Evan picks up his phone with a scowl. “Ahhh, damnit! I am sorry but I have to go for a bit,” Evan informs you.

“Good. You could use some time to cool off.”

“I will just be thinking about getting back here each second I am gone. I won’t be long. Why don’t you have a shower and get ready for me?” Evan suggests. “I am going to fuck you so hard when I get back!”

With that perverted declaration hanging in the air, Evan departs.

You briefly marvel at how strangely routine these activities with Evan have become.

[[“Fuck, maybe I am the one who needs to cool down…”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1854" name="“Fuck, maybe I am the one who needs to cool down…”" tags="" position="2545,21834" size="100,100">You find Evan’s suggestion of a shower to be appealing. You head into the bathroom and strip down.

After a bit of self reflection, you step back outside and grab Evan’s present.

You take out the dildo and wash it liberally in the sink.

//What the hell am I thinking?//

“It is just a little… Ah… experiment!” you answer yourself. You feel a bit like you have unleashed two split personalities. One side of you urges you to throw Evan’s gift into the trash, while another desires a far different destination.

The dildo presses against your asshole. It feels //itchy//. You begin to gently probe your butthole with the plastic cock. It becomes apparent either the dildo too big [[or your ass is too small.]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1855" name="The shower seems to sap away your tension and worries." tags="" position="2548,21986" size="100,100">
Eventually you slot the shower nozzle in place. Your free hands meander lower, until your slick fingers touch your behind, traveling between the cheeks of your round bum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spray.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You can’t help but feel a bit aroused. //I am feeling up a total babe right now! How can I not be turned on!?// “It just sucks //I’m// the babe… Ahhunn!” 

Your hands, seemingly possessed with a mind of their own, stroke your femininity until you cum..

//I guess it is really hard to blame Evan for being a perv...// you think as you step out of the shower, feeling far hotter than when you went in. “I am just as bad as he is…”

You dry your hair with a towel and begin to get dressed when your eyes land on Evan’s “present.”

Your shirt goes on but you leave yourself bottomless, suddenly intent on saying your desire.

You caress your pussy. Your fingers come back wet. An exploratory finger rubs across the sensitive flesh of your anus. 

&quot;[[Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to experiment a bit…]]&quot;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1856" name="or your ass is too small." tags="" position="2693,21884" size="100,100">//Probably a bit of both...// 

“Fuck, I know I should stop now… This feels… //dirty.//” To fight back against your unclean thoughts and actions, you hop into the shower.

You turn on the spray nozzle. It inevitably gets directed right at your tingling vagina.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/washoff.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhh… That hot water feels… sooo good…”

The water cleans and pleasures you at the same time. You run your hands over your body and direct the spray to soothe your aching chest.

[[The shower seems to sap away your tension and worries.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1857" name="Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to experiment a bit…" tags="" position="2692,22032" size="100,100">“A little anal stimulation might not be the worst thing in the world…” you remark. The cute girl reflected in the mirror agrees with a nod.

You hotdog yourself with the dildo, gradually working it lower until it rests at the entrance to your asshole.

You apply more pressure and the dildo’s head slowly penetrates your tight little ass.

“Ahh… Ow... “ You withdraw the dildo. You search through several of the cupboards and find a small jar of vaseline. “I can’t believe I am doing this…” You coat the dildo and your anus with lube, massaging it into your flesh before withdrawing.

You become keenly aware that you are very aroused. This strange taboo has been [[mentally unlocked by your transformation.]] //Or is that just what I keep telling myself?//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1858" name="mentally unlocked by your transformation." tags="" position="2548,22134" size="100,100">The dildo returns to the entrance of your ass, held by your unsteady hands. You begin to push and this time, with much resistance, the dildo slides inside your tight anal cavity. You are bombarded by a surge of sensations. //It hurts! It is uncomfortable! This feels really weird!// After a few determined thrusts, the weird feeling transitions into yearning. You reach around and touch your dripping pussy. You know you shouldn’t be turned on but you are. This strange experiment seems to have had a surprisingly intense effect. You slowly fuck yourself with the dildo, determined to complete the experience. “Agg… Fucking damnit! Why does this feel so good?”

You repeatedly plunge the dildo into your ass.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/analpractice.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Holy shit… Uhnn… Ah! Ah! AH!”

The discomforting sensation of anal penetration fills your senses.

“Yeah, this thing is smaller than Evan…” //The real thing would definitely break me.//

You slowly withdraw the dildo and tease the soft flesh of your asshole. “Mmmm…” You find that rubbing your anus feels good while putting the dildo inside is tolerable but not exactly pleasant.

You keep probing the dildo into your sphincter.

“Uhh… fuck, why am I doing this? I am a man! I shouldn’t enjoy this thing up my butt… Why does having my asshole teased make me so wet?” you wonder with a sigh. “Oh no…” Your hand brushes your thigh and you realize that your pussy is dripping love juice down your legs. To your shock, you even notice small drip marks on the tile floor. “No fucking way! I can’t be this excited… [[can I?]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1859" name="can I?" tags="" position="2692,22184" size="100,100">You brace yourself for a little experiment. You tease your vagina with the dildo and then work its naturally lubricated head into your behind.

You resolve to thoroughly complete the experiment for the sake of self knowledge. You reach around and fuck your ass with the dildo. To your surprise, your anus now accepts the entire length with relative ease.

“I shouldn’t… Hngh! Uh! Ahh… OHH!” You shudder and strain to keep yourself standing. After a few dozen plunges inside you, the discomfort lessens, replaced with a dull aching pressure in your vagina.

A mini orgasm splashes through your body. Your instinct is to keep going but you fight it off. You stop your lewd actions before things get too weird.

You leave the bathroom still mulling over your internal dilemma.

//Solo play doesn’t really match up to Evan but...// “Ahhh…” //Yeah, nothing can top this… I feel like I am floating...// 

“Maybe anal isn’t the worst thing in the world… I can’t let Evan know I am even considering this fucked-up progression or he will go full pervert mode on me…”

[[“Can’t let me know what?”]] Evan’s voice interrupts your monologue from the doorway.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1860" name="“Can’t let me know what?”" tags="" position="2548,22287" size="100,100">Evan’s sudden appearance startles you. “Evan!? I didn’t hear you come back.” //I hope he wasn’t standing there for too long...//

“I raced home and did my errand and raced back,” Evan replies. “Now what’s this about being perverted? Are you finally ready to unleash your inner slut, Taylor?”

“No, uh, actually I was just saying the opposite!”

“Hmm. Taylor, you’re such a bad liar. The dildo is missing. Did you put it up your ass?”

Your face gives you away without needing to answer.

“Holy shit! So how was it? Worth trying, right?”

“I uh…”

“You liked it!” Evan answers for you. 

A few seconds tick on and you do not correct him. Evan’s accurate assessment embarrasses the hell out of you. //But Evan has already seen every part of me… And I agreed to this weird relationship...//

“Taylor!” Evan presses. “Let’s have anal sex!”

“Anal…? Even that word sounds dirty!”

Evan of course misreads the mood. “I know, right? It’s perfect for us! Let’s get //dirty //together!”

//Anal sex with Evan!?  That is so dirty… and wrong. And, fuck, seriously, what happens if I enjoy it?// You feel every sexual escalation with Evan only serves to compound the power of the Pandora’s box that has been opened ever since your transformation.

“I wanna be inside you,” Evan growls.

“Uh… Evan...”

With a sigh, you decide to indulge your “boyfriend.” “Well, we have done almost everything else. I guess doing it up the ass is no less perverted than anything else we have done,” you rationalize.

Evan blinks. “You mean…?”

“Yeah. You can do what you want… but just go easy on me, okay?”

Evan’s eyes go wide as realization sinks in. Evan follows you into the bedroom while you take your place on the center of the bed.

“Taylor, you’re the best girl ever!” Evan compliments you as your clothes hit the floor. You don’t even bother to correct him. //I guess if I agreed to be his girlfriend it is a bit hard to deny I am a girl… at least for now… Fuck.// You peel off your wet panties and stroke your pussy, lusting for your close friend to fill you up.

Evan stares at you while licking his lips. [[“You said I can do whatever I want, right?”]] Evan asks.

With two fingers you pull apart your buttcheeks and spread your asshole. Evan makes a euphoric grunting noise like a pig presented with a fresh trough of slop.

The evil glint in Evan’s eye makes you uncomfortable but it doesn’t slow the now inevitable chain reaction. Within your whirlpool of anxiety you know there is a sense of anticipation underpinned by excitement. Some part of you wants this happen otherwise you wouldn’t even even be here in this position. 

//I am giving my ass to Evan...// “Ahh…”

“Hnnngghh! Fuck, Taylor! I can’t wait anymore!” Evan whispers in your ear, his voice a throaty growl. He strips off his clothes in a second, before joining you on the bed. He places a hand on your asscheeks and points his petrified member at your butthole. The last moment to call off Evan passes as his thick rod of rot flesh pierces your asshole. A few seconds of discomfort and pain later, [[Evan has filled your rectum with his cock.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1864" name="Evan has filled your rectum with his cock." tags="" position="2693,22481" size="100,100">Evan appears to be in heaven. “Uhnnnn… My dick feels like it is melting. Your asshole is so tight! You feel so… warm and soft… This is the greatest! Thank you, Taylor!” Evan rambles as he begins to fuck you from behind.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/analdeepins.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

In some twisted reality maybe trying out your new pussy was a logical course of action, a mere extension of a natural curiosity. It was //new,// after all. But taking a dick up your ass? That just seemed //gay// and potentially incredibly painful - not something you would be eager to try in a hundred lifetimes.

Yet here you are in the process of doing just that. You have your tight asshole wrapped around your best friend’s cock. Sure, from his perspective maybe he is fucking a woman’s ass, but it is still //your ass//. Everything about what you are doing feels naughty and wrong, a weird combination that stirs your stomach into knots and lights your loins aflame.

You begin to stroke your clit as Evan rams you from behind. The situation is so incredible that you feel a bit detached, as if the whole scenario is merely some sick dream.

A small part of you wonders if you will be able to bear the shame of this indecency.  //When I return to the way I was...will I even be able to look Evan in the eye?//

Your sex now is about dominance, power, and the appeal of doing something forbidden. You submit to Evan&#39;s desires and your curiosity.

“Ohhh wow… [[This is even tighter than your pussy!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1865" name="This is even tighter than your pussy!" tags="" position="2547,22579" size="100,100">“Ahh! Aiiee…! S-shut up!” you stammer. You mash your face into a pillow out of embarrassment and an effort to stifle your whimpers.

“Not until you admit you love getting fucked up the ass!” 

//I can’t do that!// A moment of lucidity seizes control of you. //I have to stop this!// When Evan pulls out, you roll over, crawling away from him.

“Where are you going!?” Evan shouts after you as you limp out of the room. “Hey! Come back here!”

A naked Evan follows you ito the kitchen. “You said I could do what I wanted! Don’t just stop in the middle of it!”

“I wasn’t uh… I just wanted some water,” you answer Evan.

Evan dutifully watches you finish your drink. He then grabs your hand. You let Evan lead you into the living room.

Evan sits on the couch and beckons you forward. “Hop on!” he encourages you while stroking his staff back to life.

“Aghh…” //I can’t believe I am doing this again… I should have just ran away...// You know now that having already done something means doing it a second time is less impactful.

You mount Evan and guide his cock inside you while [[relaxing your internal muscles as much as possible.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1866" name="relaxing your internal muscles as much as possible." tags="" position="2691,22641" size="100,100">“Yeessss… Ahhh!” Evan moans as his huge cock slides back inside you with one clean thrust. 

In your new position, face to face, you have no way of hiding you embarrassment from Evan.

You continue your taboo intercourse with Evan until lewd smells and sounds fill the room.

After a brief kiss Evan begins to pound your behind with even greater zeal. You can do nothing except relax your muscles and endure while Evan uses you like a sex doll.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/tayuptheass.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Being fucked up the butt hurts. But within the pain is undeniably an embedded pleasure. You feel conflicted as your ass accustoms itself to Evan’s rapid thrusts. Soon the pain lessens, replaced by a numbing itch that leaves you absolutely //burning//.

//I have to stop this before I go nuts...// You clench down on Evan’s penis but your actions have the opposite of the intended effect.

“Uhh! You’re tightening up again!” Evan moans. The additional resistance soon gives way to Evan’s hard, determined thrusts. “This … is … the… //best!//” Evan gasps. He leans forward, upending your positions while draping his body overtop yours. “Taylor, I fucking love you,” your old friend growls in your ear. “And I really love having dirty sex with you!”

“Ahhh…!” you cry out. You submit to insanity and the compulsion to satisfy your urges. “Hahh... Ah… I am getting fucked up the ass…” you mewl as Evan [[defiles your intimate recesses for his own pleasure.]]

Suddenly Evan stops, withdrawing his cock to the edge of your anal canal.

“I think this activity is perfect for old potty mouth Taylor,” Evan says to you, his words more than a casual suggestion.

//Oh… good idea! Or bad idea… I don’t really want to get too into this but… it feels… so … fucking… good… //“Ahh! Alright... Evan, please fuck me up the ass!”

Evan grins at you. “If you insist.” He then proceeds to fuck you with an almost violent, barbaric intensity.

“Taylor, once I have known the joy of your ass gripping my cock, how can you withhold its glory from me? That’s just cruel.”

It isn’t long before Evan is able to [[coax you into further favors.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1869" name="coax you into further favors." tags="" position="2539,22887" size="100,100">It is  probably because anal makes you uncomfortable that Evan begins to insist upon it.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/analride.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Taylor, I love your pussy but, man, your ass feels //incredible.// I could fuck this hole all day! After we are done here we should go get something to eat,” Evan makes casual conversation as he sodomizes you.

You stay silent, content to stew in the mixed feelings this act brings when you engage in it. 

You have given yourself over almost completely to Evan and you don’t  overly regret the choice...[[at least during your moment of passion.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1870" name="Head to the hotel with Lucas" tags="" position="8991,12108" size="100,100">Lucas curtly dismisses his bodyguard and escorts you to a nearby hotel with his hand on your arm.

The doormen cheerfully greet Lucas. It is clear Lucas is well known and commands a high degree of respect from those around him. //Or at least from the ones who want his money...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/luxuryhotel.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You wander through brightly lit corridors with upscale decor. The opulence of the building shocks you. You endure a lengthy elevator ride with Lucas. He constantly leans in your direction and you find yourself playing a very confined game of cat and mouse.

You are incredibly relieved when the doors finally open on the top floor.

Lucas’ room, apparently the penthouse suite, [[matches the splendor of the rest of the building.]]

“This is a very nice room you have here,” you observe.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucassuite.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas smiles at you, his eyes drifting to the bedroom. “The bed is very comfortable,” he assures you.

“Uh, I am sure it is…”

“Would you like something to drink?” Lucas enquires.

//If I do have superpowers or whatever the fuck they probably need time to work...//

You attempt to distract Lucas. “Wow this room even has a big TV. Maybe we could watch a movie?”

“A //movie?//” Lucas repeats your suggestion, clearly unsatisfied with the direction of the conversation.

“Yeah? Is that idea displeasing?”

“Not unless you are talking about a naughty movie.”

“I was thinking more like a Disney movie.” //Hehe, might as well keep things rated G.//

“You like Disney movies? Are you fond of imagining yourself as a princess?”

“Uhh… not exactly…”

“You know, Tracey… I am a man of incredible means. I haven&#39;t been this captivated by a woman in decades…”

“That is very flattering.”

“A king needs a queen…”

Lucas moves closer to you. It is clear he is angling to get you into bed.

//I have to put the brakes on this horndog! How am I going to get his phone?// One obvious method seems to be to separate Lucas from his clothes. //But that would be… // You shake your head, unwilling to finish the thought.

“I’d like to get acquainted first,” you say to Lucas.

You notice a momentary flash of annoyance but a second later he is all smiles.

“Of course. What would you like to know?”

The two of you make small talk for a few minutes. Lucas briefly relates his experience of growing up on a ranch in the midwestern US. His humble upbringing surprises you.

You sit on the couch and Lucas sits down an inch away from you. “Now I want to know about you, Tracey.” The palpable longing in his voice makes it clear he wants this knowledge to be intimate.

You shower and dress, heading to school, eager to meet your friends and continue your earlier work.

To your surprise, you spot Evan and Drew are speaking together as you enter the atrium.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/atrium.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“You guys are// friendly//,” you observe.

&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt; greets you with a wave. “Yeah. Drew and I were just having a chat.”

“What were you talking about?” you ask &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Drew&quot; &quot;Drew (Drewdesc)&quot;&gt;&gt;, confident he is the easier of the two men to get a straight answer from. 

Evan inserts himself in front of Drew. “I just wanted his opinion is all. After almost getting killed the other day, Drew and I have decided we will still help you but we want more say on what we do.”

Evan’s request is shockingly reasonable. You nod. “That’s totally fair!” you readily agree. //Less stress for me… Besides, it isn’t like Drew or Evan ever agree on anything so my vote will always be the decider.//

After a few minutes of banter, [[you enter Deter’s lecture hall]], glad to be somewhat anonymous in the crowd.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lectureanon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You and your friends split, agreeing to meet in the early afternoon to discuss the next course of action.

Your friendly trio reunites in the food court.

“Do you guys want to go after that doctor again or the check Pellard murder?” you ask your friends.

Evan shakes his head. “No, after further consideration I- ahem, //we// have determined that those options suck.”

[[Turn your attention to Drew.]]
[[Listen to Evan’s idea]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1878" name="Turn your attention to Drew." tags="" position="851,12398" size="100,100">You note Evan seems to be doing the majority of the talking. “I thought we were going for a joint decision. What do you think, Drew?”

Drew looks startled when you address him. Instead of answering directly, he removes his glasses and begins polishing them with a small cloth.

“I think we should examine the circumstances of your initial transformation,” Drew suggests.

“There wasn’t really anything unusual though!” You flashback to your awkward masturbation session. //That I want to admit...//

“Still, I feel that if we retrace your steps we are sure to uncover something,” Drew insists.

You glance at Evan and he takes it as a cue to speak.

“Yeah, whatever! Let’s play detective for a bit.”

With Drew’s help you manage to create a timeline for the month preceding your transformation.

Unfortunately, most of the items on the chart appear mundane. [[You begin to fear you might be wasting precious time.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1879" name="Listen to Evan’s idea" tags="" position="553,12398" size="100,100">“I think we should check every lead with a decent chance.”

“Uh huh… Such as?”

“Well, for starters, have you been in contact with any strange chemicals or substances in the past year?”

“Not that I know of…”

Drew perks up suddenly. [[“Taylor! What about your job this past summer!?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1880" name="You begin to fear you might be wasting precious time." tags="" position="700,12502" size="100,100">“Why are we even doing this?” you wonder. “Drew, do you really think something like... “ You pick a random line on the paper you are writing on. “...”helped Evan move his couch” could be significant?”

“I don’t know. That’s why we are doing this. None of this makes a great deal of sense. One of the few things I am certain of is that //something// happened to you in the time prior to your transformation that triggered it. The trigger may not be obvious,” Drew adds.

“But are you sure there isn’t something obvious we are missing here? What about the past year? Or your life? Have you ever been dipped in a vat of strange chemicals?” Evan asks you.

“Not to the best of my knowledge…”

Drew perks up suddenly. [[“Taylor! What about your job this past summer!?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1881" name="“Taylor! What about your job this past summer!?”" tags="" position="543,12602" size="100,100">“My job?” You had not considered the possibility of your work being related to your sex change. During the summer you had helped a local business owner with some odd jobs including demolishing a shed and landscaping a rich guy’s yard. You can now make a killer goldfish pond, but you doubt that is tied to your current circumstances. “What about it? We lugged things around for the most part.”

“But some of those jobs were dirty!” Drew defends his theory. “There could have been contaminants!”

You raise an eyebrow. “Contaminants that changed me into a girl?”

“Hmmph…” Hearing his words restated Drew frowns. “It is still theoretically possible. Whatever changed you is clearly difficult to detect.”

“Anything is possible! That’s our problem. If we just play a guessing game we will be at this forever!”

Drew gestures at the list. “Let’s finish this, okay?”

[[Ask Evan if he has a better idea]]
[[Finish Drew’s paperwork]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1882" name="Ask Evan if he has a better idea" tags="" position="398,12752" size="100,100">“Of cooourse I do! Drew’s idea isn’t complete shit, but he needs to ask better questions.”

Drew bristles at the back handed compliment but stays silent. 

“Such as?”

“Taylor, in the last six months have you been sick?”

You play with a distracting lock of your new hair for a bit before answering. “I dunno… Aside from my recent pain, I haven’t been sick for awhile. Hmm!”

“What? Did you remember something?”

“I was sick about a month ago. I thought I had some mild food poisoning. I usually get the flu in the spring too, I guess…”

“That’s because you never wear a hat,” Drew says from the sidelines.

Evan shakes his head. “Dude, now that I think about it you were down for like a week there…”

“Yeah, I did have an abnormally intense flu this year…” you agree. “I was hanging around quite a few mega babes for a bit there. Maybe some of that rubbed off on me?” you joke. After some consideration, you realize some of your flu’s previous symptoms overlapped with your recent experience. //Minus the transformation...// 

You quickly cross reference the new dates with Drew’s makeshift calendar. A month ago you were doing a series of cleanup jobs that generally involved hauling garbage to a truck and then moving it to a dump. The only unusual events around your spring flu were a few shifts you filled in for Julie for a previous tanning salon job. Truth be told, you accepted the position to ogle the girls rather than for the minimum wage or the sake of helping your sister. You suppose it is possible that your flu originated from contact with others at the salon [[but you cannot imagine how anything you did there could be connected to your current femininity.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1883" name="Finish Drew’s paperwork" tags="" position="700,12749" size="100,100">You continue to fill in Drew’s calendar.

“How about in July?” Drew quizzes you.

“Dude, I did a lot of things this summer…”

“Yeah, this is going to take forever,&quot; Evan interrupts. &quot;We have to narrow the events down a bit.”

“But we might miss something!” Drew objects.

“Who cares? We should check the most likely leads first,” Evan insists. “We need to narrow our field of search.”

“How do we do that?”

Evan snaps his fingers. “Taylor, in the last six months have you been sick?”

You play with a distracting lock of your new hair for a bit before answering. “I dunno… Aside from my recent pain, I haven’t been sick for awhile. Hmm!”

It is the most plausible explanation. Plus we can get lunch!”

You can’t hide your skepticism. “So bad Thai food turns people into women?” 

Evan seems to agree. “So what? A garbage dump and a run-down kitchen or hot chicks? Is this even a choice? Number two!”

Your friends look at you for the tiebreaker. Both options appear unlikely to yield anything productive. Still, you find it hard not to at least entertain the ideas of your friends.

//Well since both are long shots I guess it doesn’t matter what I pick. I really hope this isn’t a waste of time.//

At Drew’s suggestion, you log into your online banking app and scroll through your account history.

“See! Right there!” you say, pointing to one of the logs. “Golden Sun Thai food. Told ya.”

Evan stands up with jingling car keys. “Alright, let’s go.”

“Go where?”

“To the restaurant!”

A minute later you are in Evan’s car en route to the restaurant… apparently in an attempt to reinduce food poisoning.

Drew and Evan share a determined stride as they march into the Golden Sun. “What do you hope to find?” you ask them. 

“Some answers,” Drew replies.

//The answers to unrelated questions no one wanted the answers to... // You silently hope this isn’t an [[OCD Drew inspired adventure.]]

The sight is both heartwarming and a tad disturbing.

Evan gets a table for the three of you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/goldensun.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“May I take a peek at your kitchen?” Evan asks the waitress.

The request is a bit unusual but the waitress leads Evan to the building&#39;s rear without a second thought.

After about a minute, Evan returns. “The kitchen is immaculate. I was expecting flies and meat hanging from the ceiling but it was probably the cleanest kitchen I have ever seen,” Evan opines. 

You order lunch and feast with with your friends.

“Mmmm. I doubt you got food poisoning from this fine establishment,” Drew agrees after sampling most of the dishes on the menu.

“Well maybe it was from something I did at home?” //Or maybe this is all a wild goose chase...// You keep your dark feelings to yourself.

After lunch you pile back into Evan’s car. Instead of heading home, Evan drives to a familiar residence, [[belonging to your one time employer.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1888" name="belonging to your one time employer." tags="" position="401,13102" size="100,100">“You guys are //really// taking this detective work seriously…”

Drew gives you an encouraging smile.

“Just wait here. I got this!” Evan says as he hops out of the car and runs up to the house.

Your old boss answers the door. After a brief conversation, Evan disappears inside.

Fifteen minutes later Evan returns clutching several papers.

“What’s that?”

“A jobs list. This is info on every job you did last month!” Evan elaborates.

“Wow. How did you get that?”

“I am very charming,” Evan replies.

You roll your eyes. “If you put that much effort into your studies you would have a 4.0.”

“Boring.” Evan passes the papers to Drew for inspection. “See anything?”

//I probably have a better chance of winning the lottery than this being relevant to my mystery...//

Drew doesn’t answer immediately. He flips back and forth between several pages. “I found something!”

“You did!?” your voice cracks in surprise. [[“Seriously?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1889" name="“Seriously?”" tags="" position="546,13204" size="100,100">Drew hands you one of the pages. He has circled one of the log entries. “Removed mats and soiled materials from university gymnasium to storage depot A. Moved from A to main dump by Crew 3.”

The information confuses you. “I was on crew three but I don’t see how dirty gym mats have anything to do with what happened to me.”

Drew hands you another page. “Bottom middle,” he clarifies.

You find a log involving the extra costs charged to the university for //hazardous disposal.// The amounts line up with the job concerning the gym mats.

“What the fuck!? I wore gloves to move that shit but not proper protective gear. I could sue that asshole! What were they contaminated with?!”

Drew appears to share your unease. “Oddly, it doesn’t say.”

“It can’t have been that bad, if he let you move it the next day,” Evan assures you. “Your old boss, Carl, knows my parents. He doesn’t seem like a bad guy. I doubt he would knowingly endanger you. Just a sec!” Evan leaves the car again and returns to the house.

A few minutes later, Evan returns.

“I just figured the fastest way to find out was to ask. Carl said the mats and a bunch of linen, uniforms, and equipment was vandalized and soaked with bleach. Nothing major, it just warped the logos and colors. It also made everything stink, hence the disposal. I doubt bleach turned you into a laaay-dee!” Evan jokes.

“I guess that makes sense.”

Drew frowns. He doesn’t seem convinced.

You are confident you can cross off the remote possibility of your summer job being responsible for you changes.

“I just think we should be thorough.”

“I think we are being //overly// thorough,” Evan interrupts. “This whole thing is a waste of time.”

Drew shakes his head. “I will do some searching on the web when I get home,” he whispers to you. You smile at Drew and squeeze his shoulder.

Evan drives you back to your house. There is a long, quiet moment after he parks.

“You guys want to come in for a bit?” you offer and your friends [[readily agree.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1892" name="readily agree." tags="" position="543,13548" size="100,100">Once inside your house, you call out for Julie but she doesn’t answer. Evan and Drew sit down in your living room. You join them a moment later with refreshments.

You sit down, suddenly conscious of the oppressive sexually charged atmosphere that has seized control of the room.

You have been with these two young men all day and felt nothing. It is clear something has changed. You glance between your friends and begin to feel warm. It isn’t difficult for you to read the looks of lust your friends are giving you.

You sit in unbearable silence until you finally snap. You dash off to the bathroom, splashing your flushed cheeks with cold water.

When you return to the living room you notice Evan is sitting in a slightly different position, closer to Drew.

“Taylor, we helped you today, right?”

[[You nod warily at Evan.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1893" name="You nod warily at Evan." tags="" position="403,13594" size="100,100">“Well, Drew and I have decided that we want to see you naked again,” Evan casually informs you of their mind numbing request.

Your temper flares. You glare at Drew but he is suddenly fascinated by his shoes. You shake your head in disbelief. “You guys are disgusting!”

Evan shrugs. “Taylor, I have known you for so long that I know you’re a huge perv. You have got to be curious.”

“Curious about...what?” Your blush gives away your mock innocence.

“About //sex//. There are all sorts of new experiences you can try out.”

“Sex?” you repeat the word. Your mind seems to stall like an aircraft that has ascended too high. You fear you will soon plummet down to earth. “I am //not// having sex with you guys!”

“Not yet… but when you’re ready.” Evan takes a deep breath. His face is reddening by the second. “I… uh, //we// want to see you naked. For motivational purposes,” he explains. 

“//No!// [[Last time was a mistake!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1894" name="Last time was a mistake!" tags="" position="548,13700" size="100,100">“This whole thing is a big mistake!” Evan angrily responds. “You’ve been given a rare opportunity. Don’t waste it for us… or yourself.”

You rub your palm over your face. “Can’t you hear how twisted what you are asking is? You want to do it with a //man!//”

“Former-man-current-goddess!” Evan cheerfully counters.

“No! That’s not a normal reaction. We--//I// have already crossed the line. I don’t want shit to get weirder than it already is. Fuck you both.”

“I am afraid it has already been decided,” Evan replies with a dopey grin.

You feel a chill run down your spine. “What do you mean?”

“It’s two against one. We outvote you! We win. Now please take off your clothes.”

It takes a while for Evan’s words to sink in. “But this is wrong! Screw you! What about my fucking rights!?”

Evan looks at Drew for a moment before turning back to you. “We both vote to rescind your rights.”

You seem to be witnessing a fundamental flaw of democracy in motion. 

[[“You can’t fucking do that!!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1895" name="“You can’t fucking do that!!”" tags="" position="404,13742" size="100,100">“I am sorry, Taylor, but we just did. We need to live in the moment and adapt to modern circumstances.”

“What the hell are you talking about!?”

“The will of the majority has changed. The, ahem, people,” Evan glances at Drew, “want pussy!”

“I cannot have sex with you guys! That would be way too fucking weird! The mere idea creeps me the fuck out.”

“Then give us another show like last time,” Evan suggests.

“This is ridiculous!” //I have to flip Drew!// You address the more rational of the two young men. “Drew! Are you really okay with this?”

Drew flushes profusely. “Uhh…”

“See! He didn’t vote!”

“Taylor! Stop illegally influencing this democracy!” Evan fervently objects, going so far as to put his hand overtop your mouth.

You bite Evan’s finger. “Ouch!”

“That is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard!” you snarl at Evan. You want to slap Evan but you are sure he will see your outrage as [[violent coercion or some bullshit.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1896" name="violent coercion or some bullshit." tags="" position="552,13852" size="100,100">Evan’s bizzare accusation gives him time to address Drew, which is apparently “legal” under the silly dominion of Evan’s arbitrary law. “Drew, don’t you want to see her naked? Don’t lie!”

“Y-yeah… but I don’t wa--”

“That’s enough!” Evan cuts off Drew once he gets what he wants. “There you have it, Taylor.”

You nervously eye your best friends.

“You guys really want to see me do something ...all lewd like that again?”

“Yes!” both of your friends agree in unison.

After everything you have been through together, you find it difficult to refuse them.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/nakkid.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The thrill of being watched makes your blood race.

You rub your tingling labia. Your hand comes back slick with a strand of sticky fluid trailing between your fingers, a fact no doubt [[noticed by your friends given their sudden gasps.]]

“If you guys want a show, follow me.”

The boys follow behind you like twin shadows. You enter your bedroom and fall back on the covers.

“That’s close enough!” Your words stop Evan and Drew in their tracks. They have a front row seat for your display.

You grab Evan’s gift from your nightstand and then, with butterflies dancing in your stomach, [[you begin your show.]]

“Wow… she took the whole thing!” Evan comments.

His words seem meant for Drew. You lose yourself in pursuit of greater pleasure.

“Duuude!”

You are absolutely floored. This impossibly weird situation has suddenly gotten even stranger.

//No fucking way! My two best friends are jerking off to me!//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1902" name="stall3" tags="" position="8996,12452" size="100,100">You open your mouth to speak but Lucas swoops in for a kiss. You deftly turn your head and awkwardly giggle when his lips land on your cheek. You pull away from him.

//Shit, I don’t think I can stall anymore… I have to offer him something…// It is obvious what Lucas truly wants but you are unsure how far you are willing to go in order to get his phone.

//Fuck, I can’t be stuck like this forever! I have to succeed- no matter the cost!//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1903" name="Offer Lucas a drink" tags="" position="9149,12598" size="100,100">Desperate for some way to delay Lucas’ advance, you come up with an idea.

“How about a drink?”

“I’d love one.”

“What would you prefer?”

Lucas points to a bottle of scotch on the bar. “On the rocks.”

You pour your host a drink and make a watered down copy for yourself. 

When you return to living room Lucas is looking at his phone. At that moment he reads something that makes him blink rapidly and shake his head.

“Is something wrong?” you purr, placing the scotch on the table.

The distinguished executive swallows. “No, nothing is wrong. Just work stuff is all… it seems something important has come up.”

“I hope everything is alright. What happened? Trouble at the office?” you ask the executive in an attempt to pry some potentially [[useful information from him.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1904" name="Offer Lucas a massage" tags="" position="8847,12604" size="100,100">“You look tense, Lucas. Your job must be so stressful. How about I give you a massage?” you offer.

Lucas is happily surprised by your suggestion. It is clear he wants to touch you but the reverse is also true.

He strips off his suit and buttoned shirt, revealing a well muscled frame. He lies down on his stomach in the bedroom.

You rub your soft hands over Lucas’ hard body. Despite his age, Lucas possesses the body of a much younger man.

You lack the strength to give Lucas a proper massage but you do your best, focusing on his tight shoulders and the small of his back.

After a few minutes Lucas stops moaning in pleasure. //Did he just fall asleep?//

“Ahh… Sorry, I nodded off for a second. Your hands feel so good…”

“It’s okay. Have a nap if you want to. Everyone, even big strong businessmen, need rest.”

Mr. Ferret takes your suggestion to heart. You resume your massage until you hear a minute of continuous snoring from your host.

//Alright… I got this. I just need to be quiet.//

You snatch Mr. Ferret’s phone from his coat breast pocket and dash out into the elevator.

The entire lengthy descent is tense. You keep imagining the elevator suddenly stopping and trapping you until Lucas can capture you. Yet nothing happens. You wave to the doorman as you attempt to walk as calmly as possible from the premise. Once safely outside, [[you run like a bat unleashed from hell.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1905" name="Rub his groin" tags="" position="8706,12508" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1906" name="useful information from him." tags="" position="9301,12656" size="100,100">Your host stands up and walks towards the bathroom, immersed in poking at his phone. //Fuck, stealing that thing would be almost impossible now.//

While Lucas fiddles with his phone for a couple minutes, you imagine snatching it. //Hopefully I can just get him drunk and steal it when he passes out.//

“Hey!” Lucas’ voice cuts through your daydream. “What’s your name?” he demands.

Startled, you look back at Lucas. He is still standing on the other side of the suite near the bathroom but he now appears quite angry. His demeanor has transformed from a few moments earlier.

A chill runs down your spine. “My name? Uhh… It’s //Tracey//...” you reply in an attempt to maintain your cover.

Lucas crosses the room. He sits down on the couch across from you, admonishing you like a teacher to a child. “Don’t lie to me. It isn’t even possible. Do you have something you want to tell me?”

Alarm bells go off in your mind. “Yeah… I think I am going to go now!”

Lucas bars your exit with a wave of his hand. “It is too late for that.”

//Crack!// Something strikes the top of your head [[and the world goes dark.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1907" name="and the world goes dark." tags="" position="9149,12750" size="100,100">“Gooood morning, Taylor!” you wake up to strange voice that sounds like it was computer generated.

You are now naked on a metal table, sitting under a battery of oppressive lights. Your head stings. You find yourself bound hand and foot, encased in thick metal restraints that lock into the table below.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/corplab.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Whaaat!? AHHHH!” You panic. You flop powerlessly against your bindings.

You can see masked men in white bodysuits in the periphery of your vision.

You recognize Lucas’ voice. “We were a bit shocked to see you have already been chipped.... Even more surprisingly was the manufacturer of a said chip…. My old colleague //J. Deter//. Hmph. What a coincidence.”

//Fuck...//

“It seems Joseph just can’t leave things alone. I know he wanted you to steal from me.”

“What are you going to do with me?” you wonder.

“Well, you represent a bit of a mystery,&quot; Lucas answers. &quot;Once that is solved, I am sure we can find a suitable use for a pretty young woman like yourself. Our executives are always in need of new bed slaves.”

You take a deep breath and calm your quavering voice. “Are you going to … torture me?”

Lucas shakes his head. [[“That is unnecessary.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1908" name="“That is unnecessary.”" tags="" position="9299,12803" size="100,100">“You can’t keep me here! Once the government gets wind of this shit you guys are sooo shut down! You’re going to get a life sentence for this!”

Lucas yawns. “Over fifty percent of our business is through government contracts. Everything we do is done with the permission of the government,” he informs you.

“That’s fucking insane!” you yell back. Lucas stares you down confidently. Your head spins. Apparently the two most powerful entities in the country are joined at the hip.

Your deteriorating situation lights the fires of resistance within you. “I am not going to tell you guys shit. Fuck you!”

Lucas chuckles. “The interrogation is already complete. You have told us everything you know.”

You have no recollection of doing so but Lucas’ confident boasting makes you unsure of yourself. 

“Welcome to //Trans Corp//, Taylor Roux! This will be your new home! Don’t look so distressed! [[I am sure you will love your new life!]]”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1909" name="you run like a bat unleashed from hell." tags="" position="8707,12662" size="100,100">With frequent glances over your shoulder, you return to Deter’s office at school.

Holding up Lucas’ phone, you feel like a hero. You risked life and limb to get this stuff.  //It had better be worth it.//

You knock on the door and enter when Deter responds.

“Alright. Mission accomplished!” you say once inside. //My days as a chick are over!//

“Very adequate work, Taylor! You have done well for someone of limited means.”

Mr. Deter is greedily eyeing the phone in your hands.
[[Hand it over]]
[[Demand he keep his side of the bargain first]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1910" name="Hand it over" tags="" position="8844,12752" size="100,100">You hand Mr.Deter the phone and he eagerly snatches it from you. He uses some strange device to copy the phone’s content to a memory stick. He then removes the SIM card and battery from Lucas’ phone. Next, Deter uses an app to “swipe” the stick on his phone. The phone syncs and he verifies the data with a beaming smile.

Deter’s face then hardens but he fails to look intimidating, like someone pretending to furious while jubilant.

“Well?” you prompt. “I fulfilled my side of the bargain. Get on with it. I want you to change me back right now!”

“Well, Taylor, I regret to inform you that I have decided that I am not going to honor our agreement.”

“What the fuck!? After everything I went through!? You son of a bitch! Believe me, old man, there is no way in fucking hell I am letting you get away with this. I will expose you and all your crooked schemes! I don’t give a fuck anymore! I don’t have anything to lose! You will go to jail and be raped to death by monsters!”

Mr. Deter listens to your tirade of threats with a bored look, his thick moustache mirroring the fresh frown on the droopy lips below.

“Hey!” you shout. “Are you listening to me!?”

“Yes, and I have done enough of that. Let those feeble squawks be the last freely spoken words of young Taylor Roux.”

[[The threat makes your hair stand on end.]]  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1911" name="Demand he keep his side of the bargain first" tags="" position="8550,12760" size="100,100">Holding on to some insurance is prudent when dealing with a psycho like Deter, right?
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1912" name="The threat makes your hair stand on end." tags="" position="8704,12806" size="100,100">Mr. Deter’s confidence gives you pause but your outrage makes you bold. “What the hell are you talking about?” you ask the Professor.

“My dear,” Mr.Deter begins to speak and you immediately scowl at his oddly familiar word choice. “It means that I have won and I have complete confidence that you are of no threat to me whatsoever.”

“Oh I wouldn’t be so sure! I am a threat!” you shout back, hoping to sound confident but your soprano voice cracks and Mr. Deter laughs at your weak deflection.

“With the information you brought me I am now the most powerful man on the planet. I may only have forty dollars in my retirement account, but by the end of the year I will undoubtedly be a billionaire,” Deter boasts. “And then-- I will take over the world,” he declares, standing up tall, looking like every inch a formidable leader.

“Not if you are in //prison,// asshole! I am going to expose you. Unless what, are you going to fucking kill me now? Are you a murdering psycho too?” you ask him. Once the question leaves your lips you realize how dangerous your situation truly is.

Mr.Deter laughs uproariously. “Oh no, Taylor. I am not going to kill you. [[You’re far more useful alive]].”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1913" name="You’re far more useful alive" tags="" position="8848,12896" size="100,100">“You cannot control me! You are done! And so am I--I am out of here!” You turn to leave, throwing one last “Fuck you!” over your shoulder.

“I can control you,” Deter calmly insists. “Taylor, I want you to stop there and listen to me.”

You stop where you are and turn to berate Deter one last time before leaving but just as you are about to unleash a torrent of cusses down upon him, your actions stop cold.

For a second you feel staggeringly ill. Your sluggish movements soon become rigid. Your limbs feel like they are made of lead.

You open your mouth but your shouts of dismay are forestalled by your confusion and Mr.Deter’s booming voice.

“Taylor Roux! In honor of your service and in recognition of how important your genome was to the completion of my work, I will reward you by allowing you to continue to serve me for the rest of your life.”

[[Your eyes bulge in anger.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1914" name="Your eyes bulge in anger." tags="" position="8704,12958" size="100,100">You feel like your brain and body have become disconnected.

//WAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!//

“Taylor, you may speak.”

The whole scenario is so completely insane you outright laugh at him.

Mr. Deter scowls, his prominent moustache creating the illusion of a double frown. “You will //never// laugh at me again,” he commands you. Your laughter dissipates in your throat. //What the hell?// Mr. Deter clearly hates your defiance, no matter how insignificant. You want to laugh harder, to guffaw in his old moustached face until he cries, yet you are incapable of uttering even the barest sound, let alone even a giggle.

“You still haven’t figured it out have you? Your own eager stupidity has sealed your fate. The master command file is already on my phone. The protocol is already in effect. To be succinct: I now control you completely down to a cellular level. You, Taylor Roux, are my property, mine to do with as I please.”

“That’s crazy! What do you mea--”

“No more questions,” Deter orders and you feel your ability to speak immediately disappear, as if your vocal cords had suddenly [[been severed by a pair of magic scissors.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1915" name="been severed by a pair of magic scissors." tags="" position="8852,13048" size="100,100">//Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!// your mind howls. //Wait a second!

“//MR. DETER, YOU ARE A COLOSSAL DICKHEAD!!!”// you yell at the top of your lungs.  Followed by desperate cries for help. “SOMEONE HEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLP!” you scream.

“Shut up!” Deter roars and you are forced into silence. “This place is special. It is sound proofed and after hours, plus everyone is on the corporate take so your little display is nothing. //You// are nothing! Nothing except my// slave//. You will come to understand it, even if it is the last thing you do.”

//Heeeeelp!// You suddenly feel tired. You close your eyes to sleep. [[The last thing you see before dozing off is Deter’s smile.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1916" name="The last thing you see before dozing off is Deter’s smile." tags="" position="8704,13114" size="100,100">“Taylor? Are you alright, you have been spaced out staring at that vending machine for ages.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/vending.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You blink in confusion. Startled, you turn to &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt;. “Ev… what’s happening?”

“Man, you have been such a space-cadet lately. I said hi to you yesterday and you didn’t even acknowledge my presence.”

“I am sorry, I don’t remember…” Your memory is foggy.

“I don’t think temporary amnesia is a good excuse.” Evan studies your face for a moment, his expression morphing from amusement to concern. “Are you alright?”

“I am fine.” You glance a nearby clock mounted on the wall and feel an impulse to move on. “I have some stuff to do. I will see you around, Evan!”

For a moment you aren’t even sure where you are going, but your feet soon [[lead you to Deter’s office.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1917" name="lead you to Deter’s office." tags="" position="8848,13204" size="100,100">You knock once and enter the room without a second thought.

Deter begins to speak to you but you find yourself distracted by the lighting. The fluorescent lights become momentarily blinding. For a few moments all you can hear is the buzzing in your ears. After a few deep breaths, your vision returns to normal.

“Taylor, do you understand?” Mr. Deter asks you.

“I am sorry… What?” You blink your eyes and shake your head until the ringing sound recedes. You vaguely remember speaking to Deter but cannot recall what was said. “I can’t remember what am I doing here…” you admit while rubbing your throbbing temples.

“Good! Now come here and service me,” Deter orders.

You turn to Deter but instead of the angry outburst you mean to utter, something else entirely rolls off your tongue. “Yes, Mr. Deter!” you happily agree.

You drop to your knees in front of the Professor as he undoes his pants.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockinmouth.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Deter’s  big, fat, smelly, old penis is now in front of your face. Without a word of warning, he jams it into your mouth. You want to gag and cry but instead you wrap your tongue around Deter’s shaft. [[The manly flavor disgusts you but does not slow your efforts.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1918" name="The manly flavor disgusts you but does not slow your efforts." tags="" position="8704,13258" size="100,100">Your body moves on its own, stroking and sucking Deter until he is moaning loudly. The lack of control scares you but does make enduring Deter’s torment a bit easier.

You sink deeper into autopilot, focusing on nothing except pleasing the cock in front of you.

“Here it comes! Open up! I am going to cum!” Deter announces.

You sink down into a submissive pose as Deter orgasms all over your face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/detercum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You catch your teacher’s dripping cum on your tongue. After a few agonizing minutes, he finally gives you permission to swallow.

“Great! I want to see you tomorrow at the same time. [[Don’t be late.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1919" name="Don’t be late." tags="" position="8848,13360" size="100,100">You head home with a heavy heart. You lie in bed for hours trying to imagine a way to break free of your mental controls. You feel like a prisoner in your own body. Your imagination becomes your last refuge.

You fantasize about ways to seize control but even your most delusional hopes offer no real chance of escape. //He can just impose his will on me… With enough rules he can bar me from anything. He could just order me not to have any thoughts of my own… Ack, he obviously left me like this just to fuck with me! He thinks I am too dumb to challenge him. I really hope he isn’t right about that...// Deter’s arrogant dominance infuriates you almost as much as your lack of control. 

//Plus I can’t remember shit… Who knows what crazy commands he has given me in private...UGH EW….// Your mind reels for a moment. //Fucking hell… How much gross stuff has he made me do!?// What you remember is bad enough to make you feel sick to your stomach.

Your thought experiments fail to free your mind you from Deter. //This is worse than being a slave… I’d rather work on a fucking plantation. Being chained was one thing, bit being mind controlled was far more insidious. Fuck me! I am sooooo fucked...//

The next day you dutifully attend your classes. When Deter’s office time appears again, your [[body cannot resist the summons.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1920" name="body cannot resist the summons." tags="" position="8704,13406" size="100,100">“Hello.”

Without looking up from his desk, Deter gives you the same order as the previous day.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/cocksuckpov3.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You feel like a dick sucking robot. 

“Use more tongue. Go faster. Take more of into your mouth,” Deter instructs. “That’s good. Excellent… I knew even someone like you had to have a talent… Hah uh!”

//Aaahh… He is training me to be a sex slave!// You obey Deter’s increasingly slutty directions without fail.

With swirling tongue and bobbing head, you push Deter to the edge. Just as you are greeted by a massive eruption of semen, there is a loud noise behind you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumcatch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You stiffen in shock when you hear a knock repeated at the door. “Mr. Deter, are you there?” you hear a muffled but familiar voice. //Fuck! That’s Drew! What the hell is he doing here?//

“Quickly! Hide under the desk,” Deter suggests while gesturing at the vacant space between his legs.”

//Uh...// You seem to possess a degree of control for the moment.
[[Go under the desk]]
[[Refuse to hide and act innocent]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1921" name="Go under the desk" tags="" position="8849,13504" size="100,100">Drew’s voice has //frightened// you to your core. Your heart is beating rapidly. You feel dizzy and sick. When you look at Deter’s serious expression, your instinct is to obey and to pursue the first way out you are presented with.

You look down at the cum covering your hands and panic. //I can’t let anyone see me like this!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumhand5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You take refuge under your professor’s desk.

“Come in,” Deter calls out to the new arrival.

A second later, Drew enters.

The space under Deter&#39;s desk is uncomfortably small, hot, and //smelly//.  //Ew… I wish I had a tissue...//  You can do nothing but wait as patiently as possible.

Drew quickly tests your patience.  He proceeds to correct every single mistake he made on a recent quiz.  You can’t help but shake your head in disbelief that anyone would willingly seek out Deter’s company.

To your surprise, [[Deter treats Drew with a rare modicum of respect.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1922" name="Refuse to hide and act innocent" tags="" position="8547,13500" size="100,100">Is Taylor capable of pulling this off? find out next time...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1923" name="Deter treats Drew with a rare modicum of respect." tags="" position="8701,13554" size="100,100">Drew babbles on about various pointless minutiae regarding some of the recent reading topics.

“Then I noticed on page two hundred and eighty seven that the definition is slightly different than the one you gave on your presentation…”

The enclosed space makes you feel claustrophobic. The uncomfortable proximity to your professor’s groin is making you nauseous. Your cum stained fingers produce a foul smell you have no choice but to breath. //Holy fuck! Is Drew going go over every damn definition in the textbook!?// you fume after what feels like a hour. //Yes, it’s Drew, of course he is... //

You wipe Deter&#39;s cum on your legs. //I am going to stink forever.//

While Drew searches for an elusive page of notes, Deter moves his chair in closer, trapping you in an even more confined space. [[Your face meets your teacher’s crotch.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1924" name="Your face meets your teacher’s crotch." tags="" position="8845,13648" size="100,100">You recoil, craning your neck until you hit the underside of the desk. Mr. Deter then slowly unzips his pants, revealing a recharged massive erection.

//No, no, no!// You want to scream but the mere thought of alerting Drew to your position is enough to stifle the utterance before it leaves your lungs.

It is getting hard to breathe, each cycle of your chest intensifies your dizziness.

“While you are down there…” Deter whispers to you before directing his [[huge penis right into your mouth.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1925" name="huge penis right into your mouth." tags="" position="8701,13709" size="100,100">“Ooomghhfff!”

“Did you say something, Mr. Deter?” Drew wonders.

“No, ahhh, just been having some muscle and back pain lately,” Deter replies while making exaggerating stretching motions.

You are forced to taste Deter’s freshly discharged manhood. The sour, salty flavor makes you nearly retch but you resolve to quietly endure while passively resisting until Drew is out of the room.

The two men continue their discussion as if nothing is amiss.

Mr. Deter begins to make small bucking motions, working his dick deeper and deeper into your mouth. 

“Ahhh…” Deter moans. You turn your head, spit out Deter’s cock, and then breathe frantically. You feel like you are about to hyperventilate.

&quot;Hahh, hahh.. hahh...&quot;

“You should get some advil or something,” Drew suggests.

“I have some at home,” Deter answers. “My office hours are nearly finished. I am here until four anyway, you might as well keep me company, Drew.”

Drew and Deter engage in an esoteric discussion while you have more pressing concerns, literally poking you in the face. To your surprise and disgust, Deter [[eventually works a hand under the table and starts jerking off.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1926" name="eventually works a hand under the table and starts jerking off." tags="" position="8845,13804" size="100,100">Your position gives you a sickenly close up view up view of Deter’s cock.

You feel so embarrassed that you could die, but in this weird moment you also sense the flicker of another //deeper// sensation.

//This situation is so wrong, and fucked up, and… naughty… Ahh…// The idea of getting caught by Drew is horrifying but also arousing. //No way… Drew can never find out about this!// You wonder why the idea of getting caught excites you so much.

You wish you could disappear as Deter stubbornly rubs his leaking penis against your cheek. You silently resist until you hear sliding of Drew’s chair moving. You hear a backpack unzip. You become hopeful your ordeal is finished but instead it only gets much worse as Deter leans over and quietly but firmly orders you to suck his dick.

Like an automaton set in motion, you lose control of your body.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deterwork.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mr. Deter looks down at you with approval as you set to work just as Drew returns to his seat.

“Are you alright, Mr. Deter? You look flushed.”

“I have never been better!” Deter assures Drew.

They continue their discussion while Deter rams his huge, bulbous cock down your throat.

“Ogh om nom aahh gah om…. Hah hah...” You cover Deter with hot breath, tongue, and kisses. He soon begins to squirm in his chair.

“Did you hear that?” says Drew.

“The A/C fan is loud,” Deter agrees.

“Om… Oahhh ah glaah….”

[[“That doesn’t sound like a fan.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1927" name="“That doesn’t sound like a fan.”" tags="" position="8701,13854" size="100,100">You urge yourself to cease movement and be quiet, but instead you continue servicing Deter without care for the noise you are making.

“It is just the old furniture, they aren’t made for big guys like us,” Deter replies. “Sometimes I think this chair is about to give way. Ha ha!”

Apparently Drew can relate to the experience. “That makes sense,” he agrees. “Still, you look a little worn out. I could come back another time if you aren’t feeling well…”

“Nonsense! The only way to satisfy a curious mind is with answers,” the Professor replies as he leans back gives you a sly wink. You take his words as a veiled threat.
 
Your mind on autopilot, you cede control to Deter. You stop caring about noise and focus solely on pleasing Deter.

Deter’s answers to Drew’s questions [[become slower and less coherent.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1928" name="become slower and less coherent." tags="" position="8849,13956" size="100,100">Soon your mouth is full of precum and Deter’s hot cock begins to pulsate in your mouth as you go down on him. Sensing his climax is near, you double the speed of your motions and push Deter over the top into a shuddering orgasm.

“Ahhh…. Ahhh… Ha…. Ahh….. oh….”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deterfinish.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With several huge blasts, he fills your mouth full of salty, bitter cum.

Drew sits up in alarm. “Mr Deter! Are you okay!? You look like you are having a heart attack! Should I call an ambulance?”

It takes Deter several moments and deep breaths before replying. “I am alright, but maybe I do need to rest. I will see you tomorrow in class.”

It takes repeated assurances from Deter, but eventually Drew leaves the room.

As soon as the door is shut, you move to rise from underneath the desk but Deter’s bulk prevents you from doing so.

You look up at Deter with begging eyes, wanting nothing more than to spit out the [[contents of your mouth into the trash.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1929" name="contents of your mouth into the trash." tags="" position="8701,14002" size="100,100">“What are you doing?&quot; Deter snaps. &quot;Don’t just let it pool there going to waste.”

“Uhh…”

“Are you just enjoying the taste?”

You give Deter a dirty look that matches how revolting you feel inside. “Uh… Ew…”

Mr Deter grins down at you, eyeing his handiwork while playing with one end of his thick moustache. “Swallow it. Now,” he orders.

You steel yourself but Deter’s words shatter your resistance. Despite your internal screams, you swallow your teacher’s semen as commanded, presenting Deter with your bare tongue to inspect.

“Good. I will see you again after class tomorrow,” Deter says by way of dismissal. 

You mechanically rise to your feet and leave Deter’s office, wiping your stained lips with the back of your hand. You feel more in control of yourself and that only serves to heighten your embarrassment.

As you step into the hallway, you spot Drew near a row of lockers. //Fuck! Why is he still here!?// You dash into the nearby girl’s washroom, [[hopeful that Drew never noticed you.]]

“It is happening and I will make sure our controls are more thorough than Deters. You are corporate property now,” Lucas explains, while grinning like the Cheshire cat. 

“Please, Deter, he forced me to do it…”

“I know. I still can’t let you go.”

“Please! Show some humanity!” you beg.

Lucas inspects your face for a uncomfortably long moment. With a tap on a nearby console your bindings recede. 

“I have one crucial thing that you do not,” Lucas asserts.

His arrogant words give you pause. The executive seems to be waiting for you to answer. //What does Lucas have that I don’t? Is this some kind of fucking riddle?//

You wake up in a daze, cupping your breasts in front of Lucas Ferret.

You feel dizzy and utterly confused. A pervasive fear seizes hold of you. “Wait… what just happened?” You definitely lost track of time as you are in a different room. //How the fuck did I get here?//

Lucas is looking at you expectantly. “You were showing me your breasts,” he answers.

“No I wasn’t! You’re doing something to my mind! Stop manipulating me!”

Lucas chuckles at your accusation. “I am just inspecting my new property.”

//This mother-fucker!// Your eyes meet Lucas’ cold gaze. Your dominant feeling is one of:

[[Anger]]
[[Fear]]x

“I think I am going to like having you around, Taylor. I hope you won’t break too quickly like most of my other toys.”

You wriggle pathetically under Ferret’s gaze. You are absolutely terrified.

As if echoing your thoughts, “//You are fucked, Mr. Roux.//” Lucas concludes. “You’d best surrender and prostrate yourself before me or you will be in for a world of pain.”

You want to shout your defiance but you find that you have a lump in your throat. You hope the noise you make resembles a growl more than a wheeze.

Lucas calmly stares you down.

You realize being defiant at this moment may be a waste of energy if you plan to escape later. Still, the thought of submitting to this scumbag, even for a moment, makes your skin crawl. 

[[Tell him what he wants to hear.]]
[[Continue openly resisting.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1940" name="Tell him what he wants to hear." tags="" position="9944,13407" size="100,100">It takes a lot of care not to grind your teeth. “I am sorry. I will do whatever you want…” you answer while meekly bowing your head.

Lucas looks down at you with a beaming smile. “Excellent! You clearly have an aptitude for obedience!”

You follow meekly behind Lucas as he leads you down a brightly lit hallway into another room with a bed.

You feel ill as your eyes fall on the bed and you infer its likely purpose. //I hope he doesn’t want to...// Your imagination goes wild with a myriad of horrible possibilities.

“//Green eggs and ham//,” [[Lucas whispers to you,]] his voice a mesmerizing command that makes your brain spin.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1941" name="Continue openly resisting." tags="" position="10234,13399" size="100,100">You give Lucas the middle finger. “Fuck you!”

Lucas’ grin vanishes. “Obviously, I overestimated your intelligence.”

You catch a blur in your peripheral version. //Smack!// Lucas strikes you in the face so hard you hit the ground before you even comprehend the fact that you have been attacked. With spinning vision, you rise. Lucas then begins beating the shit out of you like a vicious monster. 

As the air in your stomach dissipates, you can do nothing except [[squirm on the floor while mewling in pain.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1942" name="drawn back to the bathroom." tags="" position="3758,2899" size="100,100">Soon you are being showered with soothing hot water and you cannot help but send your hands across your body on an exploratory mission.  You find your new curves to be exciting. Each caress is undeniable proof of your new femininity.  Your new skin is soft, pale, and //so// sensitive.  //Wow,// you think in amazement as you cup your ample breasts.  //I finally get to touch a hot girl...too bad it&#39;s myself,// you lament.

“Ungh!” you yelp inadvertently as your hand slides lower and traces the outline of your new, feminine lips.  Brushing the small bead of flesh at the apex of your crevice results in a shiver.  //My...clitoris?//

“What the hell is wrong with me?” you ask yourself.  In a daze, you shut off the water before you begin to head down the path of no return.

You awkwardly wrap the towel around yourself and head back to your room only to stop in front of your dresser.  You doubt any of your clothes would fit and a few quick attempts demonstrate that to be true.  You briefly consider going back to bed and sleeping away a week away in a hope whatever has afflicted you will wear off. 

[[Find something to wear]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1943" name="&quot;Hello there, beauty!&quot;" tags="" position="14977,10027" size="100,100">The fellow&#39;s friendliness catches you off guard. &quot;I would really prefer if you didn&#39;t call me that,&quot; you reply.

&quot;Then you will have to tell me your name,&quot; he counters without missing a beat.

You look up in time to spot an angry glint in the elderly man&#39;s eye. &quot;I&#39;d rather not… &quot;

Suddenly you become conscious that in your current form even an old man is probably stronger than you. The realization makes you edge away slightly.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be that way! Please indulge this old man!&quot; he insists.

You sigh. &quot;My name is Taylor.&quot;

&quot;Taylor! Lovely! Are you all alone, little Taylor? Where are your parents?&quot; he questions you. //Fuck this guy, I don&#39;t look THAT young… // &quot;Taylor, please tell me… did you run away from home?&quot;

You detect a tone of excitement within the old man&#39;s curiosity. It strikes a chord of alarm. //That is a really weird question...// &quot;What gives you that impression?&quot;

&quot;I have been told I have keen senses,&quot; the man replies.

&quot;Uh-huh…&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re like a flower in full bloom…&quot;

&quot;Uhh... I have to get going!&quot;

You leave the creepy old man behind. A short walk later, [[you are back inside the city.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1944" name="you are back inside the city." tags="" position="14831,10128" size="100,100">You check a store for something worth indulging but find nothing that compares to the soft serve ice cream cone that has taken root in your desirous mind.

You stand while waiting for the crossing light. As you are waiting, you become conscious of several boisterous men taking up positions behind you. You rigidly stand in place and do your best to ignore them.

&quot;Duuude, holy shit! This lollipop smells like// cotton candy!// And she is cute as fuck!&quot; says one loud young man. &quot;At least from this side, but the back is what really matters, am-I-right?&quot; //He better not be talking about me. Why the fuck is every creep in the city attracted to me!?//

You turn and glare at one of the perverts but he just returns a defiant, toothy grin. You can&#39;t help but instinctively draw yourself away. You bump into someone standing behind you.

//Snnnnnnnnnnniiifff!//

&quot;What the hell!?&quot; you shout in dismay as you spin around.

Standing uncomfortably close behind you, is a familiar old man. //Did this guy just smell my fucking hair!? What a pervert! Wait, is that the guy from the fucking park?//

At that moment the light flashes &quot;walk&quot; and you //run.// //I have to get back to campus!// You try and distance yourself from the stalker army by heading [[into the nearest LRT station.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1945" name="into the nearest LRT station." tags="" position="14973,10174" size="100,100">Once inside the station, you feel more at ease. //The cops are always nearby… I doubt anyone will creep on me here… unless they work with those suits. Fuck, I am beginning to regret going out by myself...//

You buy yourself a train ticket. //Oh I should definitely get some ice-cream...// you daydream as you step onto the train.

The car is more crowded than expected. Luckily, you don&#39;t take up much space. You wedge yourself between a seat and man that smells like patchouli.

Something wet touches the top of your head. //Snnnnnnnnnnniiifff!// The disgusting sound effect is so close your ears it nearly scares the shit out of you.

//Snnnnnnnnnnniiifff!//

You feel like you are being surrounded by an army of Joe Bidens.

&quot;Huh?! Ew! Not again!&quot; //Am I destined to attract weirdos!? Seriously, what the fuck!?//

You leap backwards and raise your arms defensively.  You stare down several confused passengers, unsure which of them touched you. One of the men smiles and you zero in on him. The look of contentment on your assailant&#39;s face makes you deeply uncomfortable. //What is wrong with this guy?  He is acting like sniffing me is a normal thing to do!//

Suddenly someone puts their hands on your shoulders. They press firmly into your flesh. You feel powerless as you look up, shocked to [[see the old man from the park.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1946" name="see the old man from the park." tags="" position="14833,10274" size="100,100">The skinny old man stares back at you. In his sweater vest and tweed clothes he stands out amongst the casual passengers. The harsh lighting reflects off his bald head. Just as you are about to scream for help, a second man grabs you firmly by the hand and directs you forward.

You try and move away but the man follows you like a zombie. The other passengers seem oblivious.

You try and mentally repel the new assailent with a psychic shield of willpower but your consternation has the opposite effect. The man&#39;s eyes light up as he smiles down at you like a madman. He bears down upon you until he has again invaded your personal space and corralled you awkwardly away from the other passengers in a small alcove.  At the next stop nearly everyone exits the car except for the two men who appear to be working together. 

&quot;Hey there, cutie-pie!&quot; the old man accosts you in a halting southern drawl while his cohort from the park keeps watch over his shoulder.   

&quot;Cutie…?&quot;  //Is this old dude talking to me?  Of course he is… fucking gross!// &quot;I am kind of in a hurry. No offense! Please let me by.&quot;

The younger of the two men scowls but, after eyeing you up and down for a few moments, his leering grin returns. He seems unperturbed by your rudeness.  &quot;I can&#39;t do that yet. My name is Bob Terrance,&quot; the old man introduces himself.

You sigh, unsure of how to make the men leave you alone.  //I guess I am like a big, bright flower full of nectar… I guess I can&#39;t be too pissed if I attract a few stupid bees…  Not like I can do anything about it. I just can&#39;t believe how pushy these guys are...//

&quot;Please tell me your name, dear,&quot; the younger man requests.

[[&quot;If I tell you my name will you leave me alone?&quot;]]

&quot;My name is Taylor.  Now please leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;Taylor!  Taylor… wow what a //lovely// name,&quot; the second man breathlessly compliments you.  He starts to breathe heavily and you regret answering at all. &quot;Just lovely…&quot; the man murmurs.

&quot;She gave me the same name earlier,&quot; whispers the other man standing guard. 

&quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;What do you guys want from me?&quot; you demand.

&quot;Your ID.&quot;

The blood drains from your face. &quot;I don&#39;t have any,&quot; you admit.

&quot;See? I told you she was perfect, man! I bet she is homeless.&quot;

[[Tell the old guy to fuck off]]
[[Make up an excuse and leave.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1948" name="Tell the old guy to fuck off" tags="" position="14833,10431" size="100,100">&quot;How about you both //LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE?//&quot; you loudly suggest just as new passengers step into the car. You then push past the two creeps and run out of the train station.

You walk for a couple of blocks and enter a residential area filled with modest older homes. Although you are tired, you resolve to walk the rest of the distance to campus and get yourself a well earned frozen treat.

//Scccccreeecccchh!// You hear squealing tires and spot a nearby van. Fearing someone might be hurt, you move towards the van, moving faster when you spot what appears to be a person in front of the stopped vehicle.

&quot;Are you okay--? Huh?&quot;

You recognize Mr. Terrance a second too late. “Excuse me miss!” someone shouts. You turn only to be enveloped in chemical smell as a chloroform coated rag muffles your screams and forces you to quickly pass out. The world fades away. The last thing you are conscious of is being [[shoved into the back of a van.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1949" name="Make up an excuse and leave." tags="" position="15131,10427" size="100,100">Under construction.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1950" name="shoved into the back of a van." tags="" position="14971,10480" size="100,100">When you next open your eyes, you are in a room with bright fluorescent lights. The walls are bare concrete, reminding you of a prison.

&quot;When I first laid eyes on you I knew you were the one,&quot; drawls a familiar voice.

Wide eyed with horror, you turn your head to face the man from the train.

&quot;What the fuck!? Did you just like… //abduct// me!?&quot;

Bob nods. &quot;I had to save you from the outside world. I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you being turned to dust when the bombs come. So, yes, I took you but… It is all for your sake!&quot;

Your eyes flit around the room. There is only one doorway that you can see. &quot;What is this place?&quot;

&quot;This is my bunker,&quot; Bob explains. &quot;I have everything I need to outlast the apocalypse! You were the final piece of the puzzle. A man has certain needs, and repopulation strategies must be considered after the radiation levels fall to normal.&quot;

The sheer insanity of Bob&#39;s words almost make you laugh… if it wasn&#39;t for the sinister undertone of their delivery and the danger of your circumstances.

[[&quot;Please let me go!&quot;]] you beg.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1951" name="&quot;Please let me go!&quot;" tags="" position="14830,10581" size="100,100">&quot;I will once you have learned your place.

We are sealed in now, so we are stuck with each other. The doors will open in twenty years to a new world. In the meantime, I&#39;ve got plenty of time to train you all proper-like.&quot;

The old man word&#39;s frighten you to your very core. //No fucking way! I can&#39;t be trapped in this place!// &quot;You&#39;re sick!&quot; Your words are cut off as Bob&#39;s broad hand covers your mouth. He slides a gag into your mouth, bends you over and slaps your ass until you whimper in defeat. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ballgag.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Once you are suitably punished, Bob drags you over to a mat set next to a long chain that is bolted into the floor.

He collars you with a wicked grin plastering his face. You feel utterly humiliated, powerless before Bob, as he chains you. He then turns off the lights and leaves you alone in the darkness. Despite your anger, you cry, fighting fruitlessly against the hopeless despair that has taken root inside your psyche.

An indeterminate amount of time later, Bob returns pushing a sofa chair through the door.

He positions it next to the chain as you try and move as far from him as possible.

Once properly seated, the old man [[grabs hold of the chain.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1952" name="Lucas whispers to you," tags="" position="10084,13457" size="100,100">“Whhaat--?” Suddenly it is like the world had its volume muted. A chill runs down your spine and ripples to every extremity. You look at Ferret and see his lips moving but you cannot make out any of the words beyond a dull murmur.

“Protocol…”

As quickly as the world faded away, it returns. You snap back to reality with a jolt. “W-what happened?”

“I was just giving you some basic instructions,” Lucas explains. He holds up a Trans Corp business card. “Do you know what this is?”

You nod. “Yes, it is a business card.”

[[“And what does it do?”]] Lucas asks you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1953" name="“And what does it do?”" tags="" position="9936,13555" size="100,100">“I must obey the holder of the card,” you respond, your voice sounding robotic and tinny. //Wait… WHAT!?// Your voice has been commandeered!

Ferret holds the business card out to you. 

You attempt to snatch it from his hand but your fingers stop short just short, as if the card is protected by an invisible force field.

“You cannot touch this? Hmm… Haha! Your face right now is priceless.”

“Why are you doing this to me!?” you wail.

Lucas sighs. “The simplest answer is just that you are the victim of bad luck. You’ve seen too much for us to let you go… so now you’re part of the company, if not exactly an employee… Now, enough questions! Sleep for a bit, my dear.”

Lucas snaps his fingers.

[[You close your eyes and the world slips away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1954" name="You close your eyes and the world slips away." tags="" position="10092,13605" size="100,100">
“Don’t you agree?” Lucas’ voice brings you back to reality. You snap awake and are startled when you recognize you are in Lucas’ hotel suite. //How did I get back here?// You cannot be certain, but it appears a significant amount of time has passed since you were last aware.

“Well? Don’t you agree?” Lucas Ferret repeats his question, addressing you from across the room.

//What the fuck is going on? What just happened?// Lucas appears to be waiting for an answer to a question you can not recall. 

[[“Yes, I agree!”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1955" name="“Yes, I agree!”" tags="" position="9993,13755" size="100,100">Lucas chuckles. “I thought you would. I am glad we understand each other.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1956" name="“No, I don’t agree!”" tags="" position="10183,13755" size="100,100">“Well good thing I make the decisions, not an airheaded bimbo like you.”

Your body obeys without consent. Although you feel foolish, you pose for Lucas.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/zip_little1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The tight black fabric of your dress clings to your slender frame. It hugs your breasts uncomfortably. You think the frill down the front looks ridiculous. Lucas doesn’t appear to mind.

“Mmmm… Yes… [[Yes! Let’s see the backside!]]” he says after a moment.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1958" name="Yes! Let’s see the backside!" tags="" position="9943,13951" size="100,100">You turn your ass in Lucas’ direction and bend over.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/zip_little2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
It is at this moment you realize you are wearing //high heels.//

To your astonishment, your movements are smooth, as of you had already become accustomed to their presence. //What the hell is happening to me!?// You feel locked into a waking nightmare.

“You are so sexy. Even without your allure I’d still be drawn to you; I’d fuck you senseless without a second thought. Show me your panties… Get on the table and spread your legs,” Lucas orders, clearing getting off by [[exercising his control over you.]]

Despite your internal shrieks of dismay, you hop up on the table while slowly opening your legs for your new master.

“I want you to take off your dress for me…” Lucas growls after a moment of quiet admiration.

//Nooo… I can’t do that...// You can easily connect the dots. //He is going to force me to do gross shit! I have to do something! Quick!//

You try desperately to seize control of your own actions, managing only to make your hands shake. //Is this what having MS feels like? This is awful...// 

Lucas apparently disagrees. “Excellent!”

You crawl onto the table, [[kneeling towards lucas as you unzip your dress.]]

Humiliated by your own hands, you fulfil Lucas’ order.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/zip_little5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;


“Yes, sir,” you answer automatically while cringing deep inside.

You feel exposed. Lucas as stares at you with a hungry intensity that frightens you.

You step down off the table and [[shimmy out of your dress.]]

“Show me everything!” Lucas barks.

With no other choice, you oblige him.

“That’s a bit better. Encourage me properly! Say, “I’m ready for you, //master//.””

Naked, you stroke your pussy until the tender flesh is slick with love juice. You spread your feminine petals for Lucas to inspect.

“[[I’m ready for you]], //master//!” you purr. //What the hell am I saying!? He has done something terrible to me...//

“I am ready for you too!” Lucas replies, while rubbing his groin. With a beckoning finger, he goads you forth.

Once in range, he grabs you, running his hands over your thighs while squeezing your ass. Lucas’ hand finally rests over your vulva.

“I could just order you to enjoy this [[but I see now that isn’t necessary]].”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1963" name="but I see now that isn’t necessary" tags="" position="10087,14357" size="100,100">Lucas slides his fingers inside you.

“Oh…” //Was that… a G-spot? I guess it isn’t a myth...// It turns your stomach that this creepy old man has been given the privilege of exploring your body. It is plain he desires more.

“See? You are practically dripping.” Lucas teases your belly button with a musky wet finger. To your utter embarrassment, lewd sounds and smells fill the suite.

“W-What have you done to me?”

“All I have done is awaken your instincts.”

“Ahh… You’re… Wrong...” Lucas finger fucks you until you can barely remain standing.

“Let’s move to the couch,” Lucas says as he gently steers your hips in the desired direction.

//The couch? Uh oh...//

You navigate to the couch on shaking legs.

Lucas sits down first. You watch in disgust as he undoes his fly and produces a surprisingly large penis. //A rock hard penis… Gah! Gross! I don’t want to see this guy’s junk… //

Once you are within range, Bob grabs you and yanks you onto his lap. Your state of panic escalates as you realize the old man&#39;s hard cock is now pressing against your ass.

&quot;Please!&quot; you plead as Bob&#39;s gnarled hands explore your youthful body.

Bob is determined to misread your words. &quot;Please continue? Hmm? Heh…&quot; He gropes your small breasts, seemingly fascinated by your nipples.

&quot;NO! Please let me gooo!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that! I saved you for a grander purpose!&quot; Bob explains while  continuing to molest you.

Although you can&#39;t scream through the ball gag, you rage throughout your abuse. //This guy is even worse than Damien! How in the fuck did this happen!?// You feel weak and powerless, completely trapped in this perverted dungeon. [[You are utterly at the mercy of Mr. Terrance.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1965" name="You are utterly at the mercy of Mr. Terrance." tags="" position="14827,10731" size="100,100">“I am going to remove the gag. You can scream if you want to; it won&#39;t do anything &#39;cept hurt our ears. The bunker is set fifty feet deep and it&#39;s soundproof. I would prefer if you are quiet and obedient but I don&#39;t mind if you squeal a bit.” Old Bob unhooks the gag, freeing your tired mouth and giving your lungs some respite. &quot;I want you to understand a few things,&quot; he continues. &quot;First off, you have no chance of escaping. Your only hope of making this bearable is to do exactly as I say. Your duty is now to keep me as happy as possible. You&#39;re my pet now. Do you understand?” 

Chained and terrified, you quickly nod. 

“Great, now you&#39;re going to suck my dick.” Bob laughs, “I knew I took that off for a reason,” he adds as he tosses the gag away.

&quot;Please--&quot; Bob interrupts you as he shoves his cock into your mouth. He hits the back of your throat and you gag. Bob chuckles at your distress. He continues to pump away for what seems like hours while you cough and sputter. 

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bunkerbj.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

If you had anything in your stomach you are certain you would have already vomited yet somehow you endure. Eventually Terrance pulls his cock out and starts jerking off in front of your face. As he edges closer to climax, he thrusts into your mouth again and deposits a massive load at the back of your throat. While still impaled on Bob&#39;s cock, he holds your nose closed. You choke down the older man’s semen. 

&quot;Ah…&quot; //That was fucking disgusting... //

“Get used to it. That good stuff is all the food you get for the first week of training so learn to love it. If you beg for more [[I will give you seconds.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1966" name="Lucas calls out to you." tags="" position="9935,14408" size="100,100">
You mount Lucas and center your pussy over his large penis. //Noooo! This is way too much! Abort! Abort! Mayday! Fuuuuuck! C’mon body! Mooooove! No! Not like that!// Powerless to resist your compulsion to obey, you lower yourself, plunging Lucas inside you with one swift motion.

A flash of discomforting pain surges through you as you are penetrated. //No way… I am having sex with an old man!//

Lucas’ hot rod sinks inside your pussy, molding your sex organs into his awful shape.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucascouchf.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You hump Lucas in a trance. The executive remains unmoving, content to let you do the work.

You ride Lucas’ cock for a small eternity until your partner finally reaches his limit.

With spasming hips, Lucas pumps you full of semen. In your state of bizarre detachment, you are forced to experience the sensation to its limits. 

The surreal sexual experience shakes you to your core.

[[You black out with Lucas’ seed dripping from your freshly used pussy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1967" name="the modchip begins to stimulate your brain." tags="" position="6125,20750" size="100,100">The new information floods into your consciousness until you feel like your mind has been saturated with thoughts other than your own. The sensation reminds you of a suddenly recalled memory only in infinitely greater quantity and detail.  

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/chomodchipflashback.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

After a few minutes, you begin to feel sleepy. After a few more, you fall asleep on the bench.

When next you wake, you feel refreshed but a bit uncomfortable. You now have a dull pain behind your right ear along with a slightly different world view.

You can immediately sense that something is off. //I feel different somehow...//.  &quot;How long was I out for?&quot; you mumble.

&quot;Not long!&quot; the Envoy answers from your side.

&quot;Wait…  I remember!  It is all here!&quot;  You make a fist and a torrent of self defense and dance images flash through your mind.  &quot;This is amazing… 나는 한국말을한다!&quot;

[[You feel like you have an endless reservoir of information and energy to draw upon.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1968" name="You feel like you have an endless reservoir of information and energy to draw upon." tags="" position="6300,20800" size="100,100">&quot;I am glad you approve. I know getting the first chip is exhilarating.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s an understatement.&quot; Strange images continue to bounce throughout your mind.

&quot;You will depart tomorrow night,&quot; he informs you.

&quot;I can&#39;t just like… pick up and leave. That would be crazy. I am in school.&quot;

&quot;The chance to decline has passed. You get fifty thousand dollars paid in advance.&quot;

The offer is so crazy you have an impulse to snatch it up. &quot;Deal.&quot; 

Ten minutes later, the money is in your account. You can&#39;t believe the spontaneity of your decision. //I guess I am going to fucking Korea...//

The Envoy hands you a phone. &quot;I will message you tomorrow.&quot; You walk back home in a daze. 

Once back in your room, you flop down on your bed, unsure if the events of the day were real.

Your life now seems like a shitty comic book. If it wasn&#39;t for the dull tingle behind your ear, you would seriously doubt your sanity.

You pack a small bag and leave Julie a note promising to be back within the month.

[[A cab picks you up in the early evening to drive you to the airport.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1969" name="A cab picks you up in the early evening to drive you to the airport." tags="" position="6137,20909" size="100,100">You fidget and look through your belongings. &quot;Oh shit… My passport…&quot; Your body no longer matches your identification. &quot;Fuck! How am I going to board a plane like this?&quot;

&quot;Ms. Roux?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; The driver reaches back and hands you an envelope.

Inside is a perfect copy of your passport with two glaring differences. Your picture has been swapped to a recent photo and the sex has been changed from male to female.

&quot;Taylor Roux… Female…&quot; You feel weirdly relieved as you hide away the document. 

Although you feel a bit apprehensive going through security, the TSA goons let you through with minimal groping.

Once safely aboard, you sit next to an old lady. The takeoff is a bit bumpy but you calm once the aircraft stabilizes.

Eventually the lights dim and most of the passengers opt to sleep. You decide to do some &quot;research&quot; on your client.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/choresearch.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


&quot;Wow…&quot; As soon as BJ begins to move, you are stunned into silence. The medley of smiles and hypnotic dance moves stirs your loins to life. The young dancer&#39;s cute yet sexy moves mesmerize you, exuding sex appeal. The Korean beauty shakes her ass and hips in a way that makes your mouth go dry. You watch a dozen more videos in a trance until the act of rubbing your uncomfortably damp thighs together snaps you back to reality.

&quot;Oh… uhh…&quot;

[[Do more &quot;research&quot; on BJ]]
[[Actually do more research on BJ]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1970" name="Do more &quot;research&quot; on BJ" tags="" position="6282,20963" size="100,100">You pull up a new video as the old lady sitting next to you gets up from her seat.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/choresearch2.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You lose yourself in your client&#39;s dancing. BJ&#39;s movements reach peek sexiness just as the song enter its crescendo. BJ&#39;s swaying, wide hips enthrall you. As BJ humps the air, you fantasize about having sex with her. //I wish I had a girlfriend like this, holy fuck… If she moves like that in a dance, what is she like in bed?//

Before you know it, you realize you have a hand on your //pussy//. Startled, your illusion of possessing your missing penis is shattered. Unfortunately, your arousal remains.

&quot;Damnit!&quot; you curse as you rewind the video and stroke yourself at double-speed in an attempt to finish before the old granny returns.

&quot;Ahem.&quot;

To your utter embarrassment, you look up and greet the old lady as she returns to her seat. //Fuck...//

&quot;You should do that //privately//,&quot; requests the women, while dishing out a disapproving frown.

&quot;I was just itchy!&quot; you explain. //What the hell has gotten into me?//

[[Actually do more research on BJ]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1971" name="Actually do more research on BJ" tags="" position="6136,21107" size="100,100">You google Cho&#39;s name and find a variety of articles, including one estimating her earnings. &quot;What!? A hundred and seven million hits on this gif!? She made a million dollars dancing to &quot;Chocolate Cream?&quot;&quot; you remark in disbelief as you read through various webpages. &quot;I have never heard of any of these songs… BJ just bought a camera, listens to her favorite songs, wiggles around and makes millions? What the fuck? Hot girls are so...&quot; //Lucky?// The idea makes you a bit jealous. //I guess I could do something similar now but I have my pride! Just having the option might be cool is all… not that I would ever use it or anything...//

You open up another article. The topic surprises you and causes you to reassess your opinion of your client.

&quot;BJ turned down an eight figure offer to star in a private adult movie for a billionaire? Wow, I guess she does have some boundaries.&quot; You&#39;re glad your boss BJ appears to have standards. &quot;Wait //eight figures!?// Hmmm…&quot; BJ Cho is an undeniable beauty but the offer still seems absurdly overpriced. //I wonder why she is worth so much...// 

Despites hundreds of videos, BJ has never gone nude on camera that you can find. //Well, I guess if you make a shitload just dancing there is no reason to do anything more.//

You watch a Vidtube clip about Korea and find it odd when several attractive women hide their faces from the camera. In several other instances you notice women being camera shy. Your searches lead you to an obvious [[question about Korean society.]] //Why do they seem so uptight?//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1972" name="question about Korean society." tags="" position="6284,21161" size="100,100">You are shocked to find that pornography is illegal to distribute in South Korea. The whole adult industry exists in a grey area with many vendors and websites banned while others remain and operate with impunity despite threats of jail time. Koreans also have strong traditional families that look down on shameful activities. //I guess that explains the market value of some sexy dancing... // 

You immediately become a bit suspicious, getting a vaguely Japanese vibe from your research. It seems a truism that the most sexually deviant people often come from the most restrictive households and religions. You recall Evan once strategizing to go after &quot;Church gals&quot; because he assumed them to be naive and sexually frustrated. His plan was successful enough to prove his point.

&quot;Korea is the world&#39;s highest spender per capita on pornography… &quot; you read. &quot;Huh? Haha, I guess they have to smuggle it in.&quot; You watch a few more videos before returning to sexy . &quot;I can&#39;t believe how popular she is… Wait, yes I can, I have been watching these videos for the entire flight! BJ is …// fucking hot.//&quot; 

The old lady catches a glimpse at what you are researching. She shakes her head sadly. Your client seems to be evolving into a Korean sex icon, growing more popular by the day. You are excited to meet the exotic woman in person. //I bet BJ is fun to be around! She is always smiling in her videos.//

&quot;I could stare at this babe for hours...&quot;

You do just that, watching BJ dance until, hot and bothered, [[you finally land in Korea.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1973" name="you finally land in Korea." tags="" position="6140,21251" size="100,100">You notice a slender man standing near the baggage carousel. He is holding a sign reading &quot;Roux&quot;.

You feel your phone vibrate. &quot;Slight change of plans. Transform first! -E&quot; reads the most recent message.

&quot;Transform… into BJ???&quot; you text back.

A second later the phone rings. &quot;Of course, why do you think we chose you for this mission?&quot; the Envoy questions you.

&quot;I don&#39;t see how this will help me do this job…&quot; //What the hell am I supposed to be doing here anyway? I am not a detective!// It hurts your brain to recall the chain of events that led you to this moment. //I am in fucking Korea … on a crazy ass quest imposed by a gangly armed weirdo I just met… after turning into a girl… Fuck... //
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bjcho3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With a sigh, you thank the Envoy and hang up. You enter the girl&#39;s washroom with an inadvertent shiver. You lock yourself in a stall and take out a pocket mirror while pulling up [[picture of your client on your phone.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1974" name="picture of your client on your phone." tags="" position="6288,21313" size="100,100">It takes a long process of refinement to copy BJ&#39;s appearance. //I need to lighten up… Literally… And I should try and relax too...// With enough focus your skin begins to tingle. You manage to match BJ&#39;s milky white skin tone as if adjusting the brightness slider on a screen. Perfecting BJ&#39;soval shaped face takes a bit longer. Replicating Ms. Cho&#39;s impressive hourglass figure gives you a dull pain in your widened hips.
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $bjcho to true&gt;&gt;
Once you step out of the bathroom stall, an imposter&#39;s image fills the mirror.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bjcho2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Whoa… Yowza...&quot;  //Her boobs- MY boobs look huge!//

After regaining your composure (and ogling your cleavage in the mirror for a moment), you wipe your drool away before returning to the man with the sign.

&quot;Hello. I am Taylor Roux,&quot; you introduce yourself. &quot;Are you guys going to take me to see BJ?&quot;

The driver and a second man in a sharp suit looks at you with surprise. The well dressed man steps forward. He is built like a reed and is the bearer of an oily smile.

After staring at you for an uncomfortably long moment, he addresses you in English.

&quot;You are// very good //copy,&quot; he compliments you.

[[&quot;Thanks! I, uh, do my best.&quot;]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cholimo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You hop inside the car next to Ji and enjoy a long scenic drive through Seoul. 

&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Ji&quot; &quot;Ji desc&quot;&gt;&gt; seems content to ride in silence, letting you distract yourself with the [[view of the unfamiliar asian city.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1976" name="view of the unfamiliar asian city." tags="" position="6286,21455" size="100,100">Seoul is a bustling city of lights and tall buildings filled with countless people you had never considered the existence of.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/seoul.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Eventually you arrive at a luxurious [[Korean villa built in a traditional style.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1977" name="Korean villa built in a traditional style." tags="" position="6140,21547" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/kvilla.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Two men in suits, apparently guards, greet you at the villa&#39;s perimeter walls. //What&#39;s up with the security?// you wonder.

When an excessively large steel gate clangs shut behind you, there is an instant where your fear of being trapped exceeds your desire for safety.

You climb the villa&#39;s stone steps with trepidation. 

Once inside you note that the building feels oddly empty.

Ji sits you in the living room and offers you a drink. A moment later he returns with tea.

You sip your green tea in silence, eyeing the house&#39;s decor. //Something about all this is really fucking weird… Or maybe its just because I am in Korea?// &quot;Where is BJ?&quot; you wonder after about fifteen minutes of awkward waiting.

Ji straightens up like an exclamation mark and rushes over to you. To your surprise, the slender man invades your personal space without a second thought. &quot;Miss Cho is on vacation!&quot; he explains a bit too loudly. [[&quot;You will take her place, yes?&quot;]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1978" name="&quot;You will take her place, yes?&quot;" tags="" position="6280,21609" size="100,100">//Whoa, whoa what!?// The fact that your employer is missing strikes you as odd… as does Ji&#39;s sudden aggression. 

&quot;She&#39;s on //vacation//? That doesn&#39;t sound right…&quot;

&quot;Miss Cho have very famous father,&quot; Ji explains in unexpectedly good English. &quot;She have appearances to do, and so, while she is resting, you will do her duties.&quot;

//I am pretty sure that isn&#39;t what I was hired to do...//

&quot;You are paid well for this easy job,&quot; Ji adds. //That part is true...//

You don&#39;t really see another option. You resolve to be careful, especially around Ji. //It would be foolish to antagonize anyone before I get my bearings…I am in foreign country...// You feel a bit weird when you realize the modchip&#39;s presence, an ever-present tingle, feels strangely reassuring. 

You shrug at Ji. &quot;Sure, sure! Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Good. You start work tonight.&quot;

&quot;Work? Wait, did you say something about… [[doing Miss Cho&#39;s duties?]] What exactly does that entail?&quot; //I guess BJ must do some sort of work for her father&#39;s business.//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1979" name="You haven&#39;t just crossed the line, you have leaped over it." tags="" position="2005,14246" size="100,100">As if triggering a chain reaction, Jerry’s cock bulges in your hand. He spurts all over your hair.

You are left with your fingers wrapped around Jimmy’s long penis. Eager to be finished, you eagerly stroke Jimmy until he unloads a huge puddle of pungent sperm onto your chest.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/chestcumsuck.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Jimmy’s orgasm seems to last for ages. You continue to milk him until you make eye contact. The lanky man takes advantage of the moment, grabbbing hold of his manhood and plunging it into your mouth.

“Mmmphhfaahhh…” Your mouth floods with a bitter fluid as he squeezes the last of his ejaculate onto your tongue. You are forced to taste the fishy reproductive fluid. //Ahh… I have been sullied by dirty dicks...//

As Jimmy falls backwards, you are left with a moment of awkward clarity as [[five satisfied men look down at your cum covered face.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1980" name="Give Robbie your number" tags="" position="1552,14750" size="100,100">Dazed by strange endorphins and hormones, you give Robbie your number.

He smiles. “Cool, we will have to do this again soon!”

“Yeah, definitely! I am up for this anytime!” Agrees Jerry.

Evan nods sleepily.

“We will see you around, Taylor. Thanks again, my balls are //drained.// We owe you one!” Robbie departs with a wave.

The party dies down as quickly as it started. You suddenly feel incredibly fatigued. You fall asleep covered in the semen of your teammates. 

The next day you wake up with a headache and a sore jaw. Your skin feels crusty and unclean.

“What happened…? Oh...”

Once your mind registers your memories of the previous night, you feel like you have taken some serious mental damage. Your hand rubs your inflamed vaginal lips. “Ow… I can’t believe I had sex…” //No, what I did goes beyond that...// You shiver as you relive some of the worst moments of your ordeal.

You want to blame the guys but find it difficult. //Why didn’t I just leave!? Holy shit! My life is going to be even more fucked up now.//

//Were we possessed by demons of lust? Did they rape me? Or did I bring it on myself?// There is no explanation or justification for your actions or that of your friends that you can see.

You feel totally at a loss. 

You head home and shower, working out knots of cum from your [[tangled hair for the next half hour.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1981" name="Give Robbie a fake number" tags="" position="1866,14738" size="100,100">Faker? Maybe next time...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1982" name="tangled hair for the next half hour." tags="" position="1712,14841" size="100,100">The next day, you head to class and meet up with Evan and Drew.

Evan immediately gives you an overly familiar hug. You awkwardly fend him off while Drew watches you with a level of embarrassment that nearly matches your own.

During the lecture you hide in the back of Deter’s class, fretting about your future.

You notice your phone flash. “Hey it’s Robbie,” reads a text.

“Uh oh…”

“Hi,” you reply after fifteen minutes.

“Wanna hang out tonight?”

“I have some things I need to do,” you evasively reply.

“Then do them quickly. How about tonight at 8?” Robbie suggests.

//Fuck, he is pushy even by text message...//

[[“I am really busy…Sorry.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1983" name="“I am really busy…Sorry.”" tags="" position="1552,14895" size="100,100">A few minutes later Robbie sends you a picture with the caption, “thinking of you.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/dicks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You are shocked. “That is so inappropriate!” you fume. //I can’t believe he sent me that. What a charming asshole!//

You try and hide your phone but Evan gets a peek before you tuck it away. He gives you a weird look while you imagine fleeing the classroom and self combusting from embarrassment.

After class you head home and sit in front of your computer, intent on finally researching your condition.

You browse the web for a few hours while trading messages with Evan and Drew. Both of your friends help to look for leads. Eventually you receive another message from Robbie.

It reads: “I am still hard.”

“What the fuck?” “Then jerk off, you jerk-off!” you text back.

[[“More fun with a friend,”]] Robbie replies.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1984" name="“More fun with a friend,”" tags="" position="1704,14997" size="100,100">
“Gross.” You reply with the same sentiment and add a crying emoji for good measure.

“What are you doing right now?” Robbie pesters you. The constant distractions interrupt your research and workflow.

“I am doing some research for a project. Busy!”

“Take a break with me!” he insists.

“No. Fuck off.”

“You just make me want you even more.”

“This guy is fucking hopeless,” you complain. You stop the exchange and throw your phone on the bed. You lose yourself in complicated articles on various biological processes until you are startled by a noise from the window.

You look outside just as another pebble bounces off the windowpane. You spot a familiar face.

[[You run outside and angrily greet Robbie.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1985" name="You run outside and angrily greet Robbie." tags="" position="1556,15043" size="100,100">“What the hell, man? Don’t fucking break my window!”

“I just wanted to get your attention.”

“Then fucking knock or ring the doorbell like a normal person, you idiot!”

“I didn’t think of that.” Robbie smiles dumbly at you. 

//Holy fuck… This guy is like a super dumb version of Evan. Just being in his presence makes my head hurt.//

“Why are you here? And how did you get my address!?”

“I got your address from a friend. I came because you seemed uptight. Sex is the best natural stress relief there is. I am at your service!”

“Guh… Please get off my lawn.”

“Thank you, Taylor!” Robbie then runs into your house through the door you left open.

“What the fuck!? I didn’t say come inside! Ahhh…” You moderate your tone when you realize you have caught the eye of several neighbors. //Now isn’t exactly the best time in my life to make a huge scene...//

You follow Robbie inside. To your astonishment, Robbie has already gone through your cupboards and fridge, helping himself to a glass of apple juice.

[[“Get out!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1986" name="“Get out!”" tags="" position="1700,15149" size="100,100">“I will in a few hours.”

“Are you serious?”

“Don’t worry! I brought condoms this time. Now I can rock your world without worrying about where I nut.”

“Dude!”

“Why are you being such a prude? You were taking cock like a champ yesterday. What happened to that babe? Bring her back please!”

“I… Last night was a mistake, okay?”

“Last night was awesome, admit it!” Robbie then lunges forward, wrapping his freakishly strong arms around you. He then begins to fondle you while disheveling your clothes. He teases your breasts for a moment before settling his fingers on your pussy.

With shocking gentleness, he begins to rub your clit and your outer labia. Rob continues, urged on by your wide eyed reaction. As he carrasses your pussy, it reminds you a bit of you how would have once felt while jacking off. After a few minutes, you feel undeniable warm and wetness, a fact that frightens and arouses you to your very core.

“See for yourself,” Robbie says, gesturing downward with slick fingers.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/soaked.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
You touch yourself and find yourself to flooded with female secretions. //Ahh… There is so much love juice… How could I be this turned on? Fuck this lewd body and my dirty mind! And fuck Robbie too!// The thought plants the seed in your mind. //I can’t just fuck him… or can I? It would probably feel good… I do have the house to myself too,// you think while biting your lip.

With a sigh, [[you let Robbie lead you upstairs.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1987" name="you let Robbie lead you upstairs." tags="" position="1551,15199" size="100,100">As soon as you step into your room, he tears your clothes off you like a ravenous, savage beast. The young man then goes overboard kissing and sucking on your breasts. Just as the experience becomes painful, Robbie throws you to the bed like a weightless doll, strips, suits up his little soldier, and then plows into your sodden sex until your legs are wrapped blissfully around him.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/fpovcondom.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Robbie pounds you until the pressure within you builds to critical levels. With one last barrage of vicious fucking, Robbie furiously penetrates you while using his iron-grip to force his cock deeper inside you.

You cum on Robbie’s dick, urged into a succession of delightful orgasms as his flesh intertwines with your own. 

“Uhhh…. Ohhh fuckkk! I am cumming!” your voice echoes throughout your room. You are glad Julie isn’t home. Robbie continues to piston in and out of you until your body is tingling and you  are drooling.

Your coitus is interrupted by a loud, authoritative knock on the front door. After a moment of panic, you [[scramble to get dressed and answer the door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1988" name="scramble to get dressed and answer the door." tags="" position="1695,15297" size="100,100">You are greeted by yet another familiar face. “&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt;!? What the hell are you doing here?”

“Robbie begged me for your address,” Evan explains. “I just wanted to make sure he didn’t rush over here and do something stupi-- is that Robbie!? Why are you here!?” You look back, horrified, as a shirtless Robbie walks into your living room. Evan bulls past you, eyes wide with anger. “What the hell, man?!”

Robbie shrugs. “Sorry, I prefer not to share. Taylor is a mega babe. It is only fair I try and monopolize her for myself. It is a pretty dick move to cockblock me like this. You ready to get back to bed, Taylor?”

Evan is shocked. “You two were… having… sex?”

“Duhh. And we’d like to get back to it- without interruption if possible.”

Robbie’s attitude pisses you off. “I want Evan to stay.”

Robbie bites his lip but nods after a moment. “Fine. Whatever the lady wants. Just don’t touch my balls,” Rob says to Evan.

Both men seem to be misinterpreting the situation. Before you can clarify things, the two oafs [[practically drag you upstairs into your room.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1989" name="practically drag you upstairs into your room." tags="" position="1555,15347" size="100,100">
Evan rips off your panties and dives between your legs without a second thought. 

“What are you--ohhhhh~!” Like a cracking whip, a sudden orgasm snaps through your body. Your pussy floods with juices that end up on Evan’s lapping tongue.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanlick.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan licks his lips as he pulls down his pants. &quot;Taylor, let&#39;s do it!&quot; Your well lubricated vagina accepts your friend’s dick with ease.

“Unnngh!” //Oh god, it is happening again...// “Uh… uh… uh… Whhy?” You feel fulfilled but confused. //Why does sex as a girl feel so good?// With a final orgasm to push yourself over the edge, you let yourself go, [[content to follow your new body’s carnal instincts to fruition.]]

Your mouth and pussy is stuffed full for the next three hours. Robbie’s condoms soon disappear, but none of you care by that point.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorfriends.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You ride, suck, and fuck your buddies [[until every muscle in your body aches.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taylorfriends2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan takes your request to heart, banging you to the point that you become a quivering mess. An hour later, you ride Evan in reverse cowgirl, accepting as much of your friend inside you as possible while Robbie uses your mouth as an [[orifice of pleasure.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1992" name="orifice of pleasure." tags="" position="1695,15593" size="100,100">Robbie and Evan remain untiring, appearing to compete against each other, using you as a prop to demonstrate their sexual stamina and virility.

I love women for their bodies, not their intellect.”

Your small hands ball into fists. “You’re an insufferable asshole!” you fume.

“Enough. You’re now my sex slave. If you do a good job, I might consider taking you for a secretary.”

You open your mouth to scream but are deafened by a sudden buzzing in your ears. You slump over and feel your consciousness slip away.

You stand unmoving for hours waiting for a command, eagerly waiting for a chance to serve your master.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/statue.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Lucas continues to toy with your body and mind. Over the course of several terrible weeks, Lucas links his pleasure with your own, while increasing your sensitivity to untold levels. You try to resist but inevitably capitulate to lust.

You settle into a pleasant routine, content to serve your master and fulfill all of his needs.

Mr. Ferret is speaking with a dark skinned man in a suit. You listen in silence, unsure if your mind is your own.

“You have done excellent work, Mr. Williams. I felt guilty keeping my newest pet all to myself. Since you were instrumental in her capture, I decided it was only fair to share.”

Mr. Williams, a powerfully built black man, looks you over with a smile. His eyes linger over your breasts and bottom. You feel objectified. Your treatment feeds a rage smouldering inside you.

“What do you think, Taylor? Would you like a new master?”

Lucas’ questions seem to afford you a degree of autonomy.

“What do you want from me?” you ask in exasperation.

“The same thing as usual. //Sex.// Entertainment. Do you want to fuck Mr. Williams?”

“Hell no!”

[[“Will you do it if I order you?”]] he wonders.

&quot;Of course! Very big audience!&quot;

The idea makes you nervous. //Well if I do it at least I don&#39;t have to see all those people...//

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can do that.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you will. Follow me.&quot; Ji leads you into the villa&#39;s dark basement. &quot;You will broadcast from here,&quot; Ji informs you.

&quot;From the basement?&quot;

&quot;Yes! In your room.&quot;

//There is something really weird about all this...//

You are led into a hallway with four doors.

Your handler grimaces. &quot;Just pick a song and dance!&quot; he growls as he practically tosses you inside the first. He slams the door shut after you without another word.

[[You are immediately weirded out by the room&#39;s familiar decor.]]

There is a small bathroom and excessively large wardrobe containing hundreds of outfits.

All the broadcasting equipment is already set up, a glorified webcam and PC. The recording program is already loaded on screen, ready for you to start recording with a single click.

On the taskbar you notice an mp3 library preloaded with BJ&#39;s favorite songs.

You bite your lip as you look through the list. //All of these are sexy club songs… If I am going to imitate BJ I should try one of her popular dances I am familiar with…// Except, familiarity from observation is far different than that gained from experience. //Too bad even the tamest of these dances will probably have a lot of guys watching… Ahh...//

You look over at the wardrobe, silently contemplating some combination of clothing and music that would be both easy to perform in [[while preserving a degree of modesty.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1998" name="while preserving a degree of modesty." tags="" position="6138,21859" size="100,100">Unable to make a decision, you return your attention to the computer. You discover a logged in broadcaster account for a streaming website. There are already hundreds of comments from rabid fans demanding your immediate appearance. Peppered throughout the comments, are requests for sexy dresses and BJ&#39;s most erotic dances.

//I should probably take it easy but I don&#39;t want to piss off BJ&#39;s fans...//

You discover a poll where BJ&#39;s fans vote for their favorite songs. The current winner for the week is &quot;Lip &amp; Hip.&quot; //Hmm, BJ appears to have the right attributes.// You watch an archived version of a previous broadcast. 

&quot;Wow… That&#39;s pretty hot. That&#39;s what the fans want but am I comfortable doing it? Maybe if I pick some clothes that aren&#39;t revealing… Ahh, what am I thinking? I should just keep it simple!&quot;

[[Try a cute dance with a modest outfit]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1999" name="Try a cute dance with a modest outfit" tags="" position="6140,22077" size="100,100">You find a sweater and a pair of white shorts. //This is perfect.

&quot;Oh yeah, this is perfect. No complicated moves at all, just smile… some hand stuff… okay, gotcha!&quot;

You dress and do a trial run without problem. Yet as soon as you actually click the broadcast button and go live, you feel a heaviness in your stomach that makes you feel ill.

//I can do this! It is easy! Just go, Taylor!//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/boomcutenesssweater.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

When the music begins you find your movements come with surprising ease. You picked an incredibly easy dance so you manage to pull it off without making a complete idiot of yourself.

When you feel yourself getting stuck or making a mistake you just smile brightly just like BJ would and the moment passes.

Your fans appreciate your dance, although many seem disappointed that you are wearing a thick sweater.

After doing a quick broadcast, [[you log off and flop onto your bed.]]

You pick out a black top and put on a pair of jeans. &quot;Wow, with hips like these I guess I don&#39;t need a belt…&quot;

You do a dry run before broadcasting. As soon as the music starts you feel it seize hold of you in a way that you never thought possible. You dance, the movements feeling strangely reassuring.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad… I can do this!&quot;

Yet things change as soon as you hit the broadcast button. Now, in front of an audience, you freeze as the music urges you to action. For an instant you feel frightened and overwhelmed, like you are about to be crushed and drowned by a huge tsunami. //All these people are watching my every movement… I can&#39;t do this!// 

Your panic triggers something within your mind. One second you are terrified, the next, like a switch being flipped, you feel completely at peace. By the time the song is only a few seconds in, [[you are already in motion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2001" name="Try the dance of the week dress" tags="" position="6292,22021" size="100,100">You find yourself drawn to a long light colored dress hanging in the wardrobe. You know BJ looks sexy in black, so you opt for something on the opposite spectrum to distance yourself from that internal label.

With a bit of shimmying, you manage to dress yourself. 

&quot;This isn&#39;t bad…&quot; you say, while admiring yourself in the mirror. The dress is fairly thick and, although it clings to your new curvy body, it still provides a fair amount of privacy compared to many of BJ&#39;s nearly see through articles of clothing.

As the music and dancing intensify, you experience a rush of conflicting emotions but you display none of them.

You feel like you have been possessed by BJ&#39;s spirit. //I have been possessed by a sexy Korean ghost!// You smile alluring at just the right moments. You dance in perfect time, touching your hair, lips, hips, and breasts in time with the song. At first you act like you are having fun but acting quickly becomes unnecessary.

You get a frenzy of enthusiastic comments and (hopefully) joking marriage proposals in the chat.

At that moment Mr. Williams interrupts, “I like her. She has spunk. I am amazed you haven’t broken her completely yet.”

“I have kept the controls fairly light. I prefer to draw out the process for additional entertainment,” Lucas explains with a laugh.

The larger of the two men turns to you. “I am Jacob Williams, the Director of Security for Trans Corp East,” the muscular man introduces himself. The Director’s friendliness makes you uneasy.

“No need to be so formal,” Lucas chides the security director. His eyes swivel in your direction you. “Taylor! Let me make this simple for you: either you obey us of your own free will or I will take away that free will forever. I will make you into a single minded sex machine if you want me to. If I shatter your mind there isn’t really any way for us to put it back together again.”

//Fuck!//

A thousand scenarios run through your head. None of them lead to a good outcome from this situation. All end with you becoming Lucas’ toy. //Maybe it is better if I don’t have control...// You don’t want to remember any of your time at Trans Corp. The small bits you do recall horrify you enough as is. 

“Well, what do you say? Will you service Jacob and I or not?” Lucas presses you.

[[“Yes, I will…”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2007" name="“Yes, I will…”" tags="" position="10088,14654" size="100,100">You opt for retaining even a tiny illusion of control, hopeful the disgusting experience may lead to a chance for escape.

“Get on the desk.” Jacob’s words come off as authoritative. He is clearly a man used to being obeyed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/csdesk.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You lean back on the desk and Jacob is on you in a flash. As you look up at the huge man it is [[impossible not to be scared.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2008" name="“Eat shit, you fucki--”" tags="" position="9790,14650" size="100,100">Your voice cuts off as shock reverberates throughout your body. You feel like you have been hit with a taser.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2009" name="impossible not to be scared." tags="" position="9940,14708" size="100,100">Jacob grabs your panties and pulls, revealing your bare pussy.

Jacob stares at your nether regions with a primal intensity. Each second under his gaze makes you heat up. //This is so embarrassing… and worse than that… My pussy is...//

“Very nice! You’re a lucky man, Lucas,” [[Jacob says to his colleague.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2010" name="Jacob says to his colleague." tags="" position="10088,14798" size="100,100">“Uhhh! Ohh!” you cry out as Jacob’s thick finger slides inside you.

“I am unsurprised,” Lucas replies.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/csdesk3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Schlick schlick schlick...//

Jacob continues to rub your privates. He seems determined to make you cum. 

You do your best to deny him that satisfaction. You try and take your mind of the growing arousal building inside you. //Baseball… Puppies… AHH… baking cookies with mom! Ahhhh!// Nothing seems to work. When Jacob finally wraps his lips around your buzzing clit, your resistance crumbles into oblivion.

Your body convulses as you orgasm at the mercy of Jacob’s hands and tongue. “Ahhhhhhhhhh! Uhhhnnnn…” [[you moan as you squirm on the desk.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2011" name="you moan as you squirm on the desk." tags="" position="9940,14856" size="100,100">//Noo… I came?// Gaining pleasure from these ugly men is not something you expected.

//Something bigger...// Your mind has become hazy.

//Ziiiip.//

Jacob produces a large erection. You stare at it in shock. //There is no fucking way I am touching that thing!//

“You agreed to service us,” Lucas chides you.

You look between the strong, uncompromising men and choose your words carefully.
[[“I don’t have a choice…”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2012" name="“I don’t have a choice…”" tags="" position="9789,14950" size="100,100">“Correct,” Lucas agrees.

Unable to deny or alter what is happening, you take Jacob’s throbbing penis in hand.

“Thatta girl! Oh damn, your hand feels amazing… so soft… Ahhh… Keep going!”

You kiss Jacob’s penis. As your lips touch the soft, springy flesh of his glans, you are greeted by a salty-bitter tang.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/csckiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//I can’t believe this is happening… I am sucking a fucking dick!//

Just when you think things cannot get any worse, [[Lucas pushes his way forward.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2013" name="“I have changed my mind!”" tags="" position="10083,14950" size="100,100">“You won’t have one in a moment.” Lucas holds up the  business card. “//Bimbo charade,//” he intones, as if the words are some kind of magic spell.

You feel no different, until you look at Jacob and your breath catches in your throat. Your heartbeat speeds up and, for a second, the ugly man in front of you has the same aura as //Samantha.// Feelings of love and euphoria spill out from your heart. //This can’t be happening!//

Jacob leans in close to you until you can feel the heat of his breath on your lips. “Kiss me,” he huffs.

You blink in confusion. “What? No-NO-uh … Mnnnhah!”

You’d rather kiss a viper than another man yet here you are with your lips pressed against a man that stinks like cigarettes and sweat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/jacobkiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your mouth is mashed against Jacob’s. He kisses you sloppily. His tongue and stubble feels disgusting.

Jacob stuffs his tongue in your mouth and your return the kiss. It takes you a couple of minutes before you regain your sanity. 

“What have you done to me!?” you explode once your mouth is free.

Lucas rolls his eyes. [[“I have merely pushed you one step closer towards the person you are meant to be.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2014" name="“I have merely pushed you one step closer towards the person you are meant to be.”" tags="" position="10237,15004" size="100,100">“Nooo…” you whimper as saliva covers your cheek.

Jacob seems annoyed by your reactions. “Hey, you agreed to this.”

“That doesn’t mean I have to enjoy it.”

“But you clearly are… You’re like a bitch in heat. Don’t try and deny it. I can //smell you//. You&#39;re dripping all over the desk, so don’t even try and act like anything except the whore that you are.”

“I am not a whore,” you answer, but your state of undress makes the words seem a bit hollow.

“I would have settled for getting my dick sucked but now I want to teach you a lesson.” Jacob forces your legs apart and lines up his manhood against your vagina.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/csinsert.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Against Jacob’s strength, all you can do is whimper as he fills you with cock.

“St-s-t-STOP! Take it ouuut!”

“Okay.” Jacob withdraws his shiny penis completely… [[before ramming it right back inside you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2015" name="before ramming it right back inside you." tags="" position="10085,15102" size="100,100">“Hnnnngghhaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!” //No way!//

//I am doing it with some guy I don’t even know... And worst of all, it doesn’t even feel bad...//

As Jacob thoroughly plows you, eventually you give in to another orgasm, leaning back on the desk as he continues to pound you.

[[You are greeted by the sight of Lucas’ cock.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2016" name="You are greeted by the sight of Lucas’ cock." tags="" position="10241,15156" size="100,100">Lucas takes advantage of your slack jawed daze and thrusts his cock into your mouth. The executive plays with your breasts while you endure the movements of two penises seeking pleasure within your body.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cstwo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Eventually your neck gets sore and you attempt to shift position. Jacob picks you up, still impaled inside you, he spins you around and drapes you off the edge of the desk. Half supported by your own trembling legs, half by Jacob, [[you barely remain upright as he begins to fuck you from behind.]]

You lock eyes and the strange gooey warmth of a childhood crush spreads throughout your brain. Lucas’ image and Sam’s seem to become one in your mind until only Lucas’ visage remains.

//I got to get away from this ugly creep! Although I guess he isn’t really ugly… Huh?//

“Ahh…”

“What’s wrong, Taylor? You look a little flushed,” Lucas teases you as he moves closer. His strong cologne makes you dizzy.

“Ahhh… I can’t …”

“Can’t what?”

You stare at Lucas’ face, unable to look away. Your eyes center on his lips and the next thing you know you are //kissing// Lucas Ferret while cradling his hard penis (all while Jacob continues working on you from behind).
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cstwo2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cscum2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Before you can retch, Jacob grabs your hips and begins to assault your pussy with great voluminous thrusts. He rapidly humps you before going balls deep and [[filling your womb with unwanted semen.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2020" name="filling your womb with unwanted semen." tags="" position="10225,15450" size="100,100">
You end up the floor, dripping cum from both ends of your body.

“Taylor, you did a passable job,” Lucas informs you. “You definitely need more practice though.”

Your anger reaches a boil and overflows. //I can’t take their bullshit anymore!// “You deserve life in prison for this!” you shout at Lucas.

The Executive gives you a patronizing smile. “Well, what people //deserve// and what //they get// are two entirely different things. Have you ever heard of a man like me going to prison? No? That’s because it doesn’t happen. Now shut up and be a good little girl. You will follow my instructions.”

“Fuck off!”

Lucas grabs your arm and practically drags you to the back of the room. You try and fight him off but find his grip to be unbreakable. //Is he that strong? Or am I just that weak? Damnit!// 

Unable to fend off his advances, you get manhandled into a corner.

“Don’t worry, Taylor. [[I am just going to make a few small adjustments]] to make you a bit more suited for general duties.”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbotay.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Correction: you //are// a bimbo. Is a bird anything other than a bird? You are what you are, Ms. Roux,” Lucas patronizes you from the doorway.

At least before you looked like a normal girl. Now you are an abomination, a form created purely for male pleasure and amusement. 

Your long nails and hair mark every movement with a reminder of your outlandish appearance. Your chest is so large your balance feels off.

//Noooooooooooooooooooo!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cslbj.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas has a much stronger taste. You barely fight off the impulse to throw up as Lucas gleefully facefucks you. 

“Guh, guh, guh!” //I can’t fucking breathe!// Just as you are about to pass out, Lucas withdraws from your mouth.

As you desperately  gasp for breath, the men [[push you off the desk and onto your knees.]]

“That feels great, babe! You really know how to handle cock!” Jacob encourages you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cstwoknees.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You do your best to get your oppressors off. You match your movements and jerk off both men until you have no idea what is going on anymore.

“Put that mouth to work,” Lucas says as he grabs the back of your head and impales you with his cock.

Everyone seems to be breathing heavily. You just keep slurping and jerking while praying this moment will soon be over.

[[But finishing has its own problems.]] //I want them to cum but--//

Your mouth fills with precum as you turn away from Lucas only to move directly into a jet of cum.
 
Jacob erupts first, spraying you with cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cscum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I am cumming too!” Lucas groans.

As you sit down with a foul taste lingering in your mouth, you regret agreeing to take part in their perversions.

//I hope this was worth it… But what good is keeping my mind if I have to deal with this shit?//

You are groped, slapped and teased until Bob takes out a riding crop and begins to whip you.

&quot;Ahh! Maaah!  Mppphh! Stop! Waaaahh…. Help!&quot; you cry in muffled agony as you are struck.

Your legs and backside are soon covered in bright red marks.

If you get a peek inside a treasure chest, well that is only incidental.

You pull open the drawer and are instantly disappointed. The drawer is //completely empty.//

&quot;Uhh…? Huh?&quot; You pull open several more. Every single drawer except the one clearly meant for underwear is full to overflowing. &quot;What the fuck? Did Sophie get abducted by a fuckin&#39; panty thief!?&quot;

Your question makes your hackles rise.

//Panty thief… Wait a second! CRAIG! He stole my clothes, so….// You don&#39;t like the path your thoughts have been set down. &quot;I thought Craig was harmless but could he have driven Sophie away? Is that even possible? Why the hell would the Bells side with Craig over their daughter?&quot; The whole scenario doesn&#39;t seem to add up. Two things are clear: Craig has issues and Sophie is nowhere to be found. Whether the two threads are connected is unproven, but the mere idea makes you feel sick to your stomach. //Sophie… what happened to you?//

You would bet a million bucks that the contents of Sophie&#39;s panty drawer are now secreted within Craig&#39;s room.

&quot;Craaaaaaaaaaaaaig!&quot; you growl his name through clenched teeth. [[You are starting to think Craig might need a solid asskicking.]]

As soon as the mounds on your chest are covered, you give the room a more thorough investigation.

Spotting something out of the ordinary, you flip over the only overturned picture frame in a long line. Craig&#39;s broad face smiles back at you.

Sophie&#39;s room creeps you out. It reminds you a bit of nursery you had seen years earlier. Your cousin had lost a child shortly after birth, choosing to leave the nursery untouched as some sort of bizarre shrine. 

&quot;What the hell happened to Sophie?&quot; You have a sinking feeling that something bad has happened to her. &quot;I have to deal with Craig now though…&quot;

You find a pair of yoga pants and are barely able to squeeze your ass into them.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/pants.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Once clothed, you return to confront Craig.

You sneak up the door and listen. You hear porcine like grunting noises from inside. //Ehh...//

After a few seconds, the knob turns. Craig opens the door, clearly disappointed that you have found alternative clothing.

&quot;I am //really// sorry! It was just a prank!&quot; he answers while offering you a bundle of your clothing.

&quot;Why did you steal my clothes? What the hell is wrong with you?&quot; The last question slips out despite your attempts to calm the raging storm of anger within you.

Your question causes Craig to turn his head sideways like a confused puppy. &quot;You smell really good and your panties smell really-//really// good,&quot; Craig answers. 

&quot;What?&quot; You are absolutely floored; Craig&#39;s combination of cunning and blunt stupidity stuns you. It takes you several seconds to register his words and reply. &quot;Y-you were //sniffing// my underwear!?&quot;

Craig nods. &quot;Uh huh.&quot;

As you stare at Craig&#39;s face, you evoke an internal fight or flight response. Craig and his actions are so repulsive you want to distance yourself from him, while simultaneously desiring to inflict upon Craig ample pain as punishment.

//I can&#39;t just leave like this...//

The sound of your slap echoes throughout the room, surprising both of you with its loud crack. Craig looks at you with eyes wide from shock as his hand rubs the rapidly reddening handprint now adorning his chubby face.

&quot;Y-you //h-h-hit me!//&quot; Craig stammers. His eyes well with tears.

&quot;Yeah, and you fucking deserve it.&quot;

&quot;Y-you can&#39;t hit me!&quot;

&quot;I just did.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not allowed!&quot; Craig whimpers.

&quot;Neither is stealing people&#39;s clothes! You nearly slammed my fingers in the damned door! You have the mind of a child! If you want to be a man, you should fuckin&#39; act like it!&quot;

//Maybe I can borrow a shirt from Sandra...// As you head to Sandra&#39;s room, you stop outside Sophie&#39;s. &quot;Hmm…&quot; Your old friend is very petite but you find the idea of wearing some of her clothes to be only slightly less weird than her mother&#39;s - even if Sandra is probably a closer match.

Your fingers dance near the top drawer. You feel an itch of curiosity and excitement. //Gulp…. Is this Sophie&#39;s //panty// drawer?//

//Wow, I must look like such a deviant right now! Naked in this room, salivating over my friend&#39;s panty drawer… How did I go from pissed off to turned on? What the fuck is wrong with me?//

//Uhh… Wow, that is the look of someone who tortures small animals in the woods at night... // Your appraisal of Craig as harmless is quickly changing.

Craig begins to huff and puff in irritation. For a bit, it sounds like he is hyperventilating. //Oh shit, now he is going to die from a fucking heart attack!// For an instant, your concern outweighs your caution.

You take a step towards Craig. &quot;Are you alright? Cra---aaaaahhhhhh GAUUHHHH!&quot;

Before you are even sure what is happening, Craig&#39;s arm flashes out, punching you square in the stomach.

The blow knocks you halfway across the room and you topple to the floor. The young man&#39;s sudden aggression catches you completely off guard. &quot;Haahh… Guh-guh… Ah! Gahh…&quot; Unable to breath, you gasp for air as Craig stands over you.

//Oh my god. Is he trying to kill me!?// You are already terrified but when Craig begins to rub his groin, your terror increases to critical levels. //No. Just no. I am not going to be raped by Craig!//

Surprising both Craig and yourself, you barely manage to rise to your feet.

You know you can&#39;t defeat Craig in a contest of strength but your desire to retaliate eclipses any common sense. //I will claw his fucking eyes out!//

The two of you square off. Even though you feel foolish for wanting to fight, your macho pride allows no other recourse but to defend yourself.

Craig lunges at you and you slap his hand away.

With fear in your opponent&#39;s eyes, you strike with everything you have. You slug Craig in the stomach and you are as surprised as Craig by how //heavy// the blow feels.

//C’mon internet! Solve my problems!//

Two hours later, you are ready to smash your head against your keyboard in frustration.

Without any luck using generic search pages, you decide to focus your efforts on a few different forums more directly.

To your surprise, you quickly get a hit that makes your jaw drop.

“Anyone ever hear of Transfigure? New virus has fucked up my phone and life!” reads the title of a  Plebbit post.

“Whoa!” you click so fast your mouse nearly flies apart.

“Hmm…” The original message is vague with most of the information contained within the headline. 

The commenters generally berate the original poster for being careless or stupid.

“How did losing a phone ruin your life? Loser!” reads one comment.

Your eyes widen with surprise. The OP replied to the message: [[“It changed me into a woman.”]]

The original poster does not elaborate further, despite numerous attempts from commenters to goad the OP into posting. Reading through the comments, you note a theme of disbelief… which is quite understandable.  

“Transfigure? Sounds kinky!” comments user BabyJ91.

“Is this some kind of role play?  Pretty hot!” reads another comment.

The only other post from the thread’s author reads: “This is not a joke! I need help!” The post is dated three weeks before your transformation.  The next ten comments make fun of the original poster.

“ROFLMAO You need help all right!!”

“Is there really someone out there like me?” you wonder aloud.

“OP is probably dead,” [[reads the last message of the thread.]]

FUCK!”

You feel yourself deflate. For a few precious seconds, you had felt you were on the verge of discovery, victory was briefly in sight and now had been snatched cruelly away.

You search through the profiles and post history of everyone on the thread and find nothing relevant.

“Daaaaaaamn! I guess I just have to leave a message and wait…”

Typing out several prospective messages, you finally settle on. “I believe you! I am interested in your story and have a similar one of my own,” you write.

“Hmm, should I send this privately or leave a public comment?”

After searching another hour, you derail your search to watch random videos before falling into bed and passing out.

The next morning, you wake up to a flashing indicator on your Plebbit inbox.

“I can DEFINITELY help you!!!” reads the start of an enthusiastic private message. “132 A Bernard Street, back entrance. Ask for Tanya and be discreet,” it finishes. 

The message is sent from a new user, created that morning.

“Uhhhh… This is pretty shady.” You reread the message several times, unsure if it is authentic or sent by some kind of bot.

“Who is this?” you reply.

You wait on pins and needles for fifteen minutes. “Tanya,” the user finally answers. “I might be able to help you with Transfigure, if you really have it.”

“Hmm....” //I guess she does know something…// “Even if it is a long-shot, I need help! I can’t really turn her down either; I don’t have anything else to go on. Beggers can’t be choosers...&quot;

You pull up a map of the area and scope it out. As expected, the area is more than a bit rough.

A metal slot opens with a horrible screech. A laser scanner looks you over, like a dragon’s burning eye.

After a moment of silent consideration, the door’s ai or operator deems you suitable for entry.

The door opens with a clear difference in pressure and an eerie cloud of bluish smoke.

You timidly enter the doorway, stepping into an airlock-like structure. Once inside, the outer steel door slides shut behind you, leaving you trapped.

//Uh oh… This is probably not my brightest moment!//

Just when as you are fearing the worst, the door opens into a laboratory that looks as impressive as any other you have seen at the university.

“So, why are you in this shithole?” //Oops… That was probably too much.//

Tanya eyes you over for a moment before answering. “There is close proximity to abundant test subjects,” she replies.

A chill runs down your spine. “You mean--?”

“Hah. Your face right now is priceless!” Tanya teases you. “I am joking, obviously! Or am I? The truth is… I’m here because the rent is cheap, clearly!”

The strange interaction leaves you frazzled. 

“Well, let’s see what ya got!” Tanya holds out her hand. [[“Show me your phone please.”]]

“What’s the good news?” you wonder.

“I can definitely help you.”

“You can?! Thank fuck!” //She can cure me!?// The revelation makes you stupidly happy.

Your happiness is short-lived. “Sure, no problemo!” Tanya says with a smile. “Just cough up ninety thousand cash and you will be good as new!”

You blink a few times. “EHHHH!!? //NINETY-FUCKING-THOUSAND!?// How am I supposed to get that!? I am a student!”

“How should I know? Borrow, beg, steal, whatever. Go shake your ass a bit, that is probably worth a few bucks! Or, you could, ya know,// work for it.//”

“This nightmare keeps getting worse…” Your treatment might as well cost a million dollars, let alone ninety thousand bucks; both sums seem utterly unattainable.

Tanya yawns with exaggerated arm movements. “Well, let me know once you have the cash. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, I have a few experiments I am trying to monitor…”

You hesitate but follow instructions, sticking your hand inside while a pale yellowish light bathes your flesh in its off-putting glow.

Your hand begins tingle like it is falling asleep. The tingling sensation quickly changes to //pain.// You are beginning to suspect your flesh is being microwaved or something.

“AH! Ow! Fuck!” you voice your discomfort.

“Oh, suck it up. No pain, no gain! You can do it!” Tanya cheers from the sidelines.

Your fingers bulge and elongate until they remind you of a time not long ago. You can even make out tiny hairs sprouting on the bridge of your fingers. Gradually, they darken in color until your hand looks like it belongs to a man. Side by side your unaltered left, the difference is stark.

Your hand regresses back into femininity within moments of removal from the strange machine.

Tanya gives you a thumbs up. “Pretty cool, right? Let me know when you find the cash. It shouldn’t be hard for a resourceful //young gal// like yourself!”

Attempting to pry additional information from the mysterious scientist, you try to innocently ask a few questions. Tanya’s cheerful demeanor quickly vanishes and, a minute later, you find yourself back on the street, nearly crashing into a homeless man injecting himself with a needle.

[[You make an awkward exit and return home.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2051" name="You make an awkward exit and return home." tags="" position="2851,12045" size="100,100">Your sudden need for money frays your nerves. You find yourself sighing at a rate far above normal. The only realistic answer to your money woes that you can think of is asking your parents for help. “Ahhhh…. NOPE! I am not having this conversation with my mom!”

//Fuck, I can’t let myself get depressed! I have to stay level headed at take control before I spend too long like this!//

“Wooo… Damn this gorgeous female body! … Hmmm, speaking of gorgeous female bodies… Maybe I should call Rhea for some //stress relief?//” 

You text Rhea, asking if she would like some company. She replies within seconds.

Wasting no time, you rush to Rhea’s place.

“Coooooooooome~ In~!” [[Rhea calls from the doorway.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2052" name="Rhea calls from the doorway." tags="" position="3003,12143" size="100,100">Rhea is waiting for you on the couch in the living room.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rhea1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Are you waiting for an invitation or something?”

Your eyes rove over Rhea’s bold features, pausing to admire the young woman’s full breasts and lips. After a few seconds, your mouth goes dry. You find that Rhea’s intoxicating presence naturally inspires lust driven thoughts to pervade your mind.

If you were still a man, you are certain you would be //rock hard //right now.

Instead, now you are a //sopping mess//. You want to fuck Rhea so badly but you realize you will have to fight this erotic battle with a limited toolset.

A brilliant idea pops into your mind. //Toolset eh…? Mental note: buy some toys to punish Rhea!//

In the meantime, [[you are left with only your digits and tongue.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2053" name="you are left with only your digits and tongue." tags="" position="2847,12197" size="100,100">Rhea strikes first. She peels off your wet panties while kissing you on your cheek… your //butt//-cheek. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheataylowerk.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mwah! You’ve got a cute little ass, Taylor,” Rhea murmurs, her silky voice sounding slightly drunk. “I could kiss you all day… [[Top or bottom!]]” she adds with a grin.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2054" name="Top or bottom!" tags="" position="2999,12291" size="100,100">Unwilling to be beaten in your sexy competition, you pounce on Rhea, tumbling around until your face is nestled between Rhea’s shapely legs.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/rheacomp.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You delight in Rhea’s musky scent, eager to obscure the embarrassing odor of your own arousal.

Lunging forth while covering Rhea’s delicate labia with wet kisses, you continue your attack until she is left squirming. Despite your best efforts, your opponent refuses to yield. Rhea counterattacks, beginning her own, much more thoughtful exploration of your pussy with an experienced tongue. Once you are suitably wet, Rhea rubs your buzzing clitoris until you cum.

You eat out Rhea, desperately trying to mirror the pleasure undulating through your own tingling body.

Hours later, [[you end up in a tangle of sweaty limbs.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2055" name="you end up in a tangle of sweaty limbs." tags="" position="2851,12341" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheatayqualitytime.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmm… Thanks, Rhea! I needed that!”

“You seem more high-strung than usual,” Rhea observes. “What’s been eating you, aside from me?”

You briefly explain your sudden need for a large sum of cash. “There is no way I can make ninety fucking grand!” you conclude. With your sexual needs satisfied, you begin to hopelessly fixate on the enormous task in front of you.

Rhea shrugs. “You can make a lot of money doing what I do.”

Rhea’s dismissive tone makes you cautious. Your mind invariably turns to several shady possibilities. You know for a fact Rhea’s family is not well off. That never stopped Rhea from wearing expensive clothes and jewelry. You had always assumed she was a credit card junkie... or maybe something else.

[[“I am not a whore!”]] Rhea preempts you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2056" name="“I am not a whore!”" tags="" position="2995,12443" size="100,100">“Oh… Hey! I never said you were!” //That scared me for a sec there...//

“I merely do compensated dating and a little bit of escorting here and there,” Rhea explains.

//Wait! That is exactly what I was thinking!// “Isn’t that the… same thing?”

“No way, this is just taking advantage of my temporary gift of beauty! Why did God make me so sexy if he didn’t want me to have sex?” Rhea muses. 

Rhea hardly strikes you as the religious type. She laughs at your confusion. 

“Taylor! You have the same power now! You’re beautiful! Use it. They call ass a “money maker” for a reason.”

[[“This conversation is making me uncomfortable.”]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2057" name="“This conversation is making me uncomfortable.”" tags="" position="2851,12497" size="100,100">Rhea attempts to elaborate betweens peals of laughter. “Look, it is just nature. Men are strong, so they lift things. Women are pretty, so they get men to lift their things.”

“That doesn’t make any sense…”

“Sure it does. Lighten up, Taylor! I will introduce you to some of the guys I work with- if you want me too.” Rhea produces a box of glittering diamonds from her night stand. To your untrained eye, there appears to be a small fortune in jewelry. “The clientele is very generous,” Rhea explains “I bought one of these - the rest are gifts.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/diamond.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Rhea’s sudden (and unlikely) display of wealth lights up dollar signs in your eyes. “Um. What exactly would I have to do?”

“It is all consensual. You do whatever you want for whatever price you want. Some girls just flirt and maybe dance, or spend a bit of time with a lonely fellow for a few hours over dinner.

“You want me to be an… escort?”

“It is a really easy job with an hourly rate that can’t be beat.”

“Do you do um…” //How do I phrase this?// “-Dirty stuff?”

“Haha! Oh, Taylor. For someone with such a potty mouth, you come off as a bit naive sometimes. Don’t worry! I bet you will be really popular and earn a nice nest egg in no time. If you want to give a few handies or blowies to get to your goal faster, that’s up to you. [[I could always teach you a few things,]]” Rhea offers.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2058" name="I could always teach you a few things," tags="" position="2999,12591" size="100,100">Your head is left spinning. “No way! I can’t do that! … Can I?”

“Yes you can! Hah! You’re considering it. What’s holding you back?”

“My sense of self respect!”

Rhea bites her lip. “So you don’t respect women who have sex?” she asks you while running a hand on a meandering path down your inner thigh.

“Hey! That isn’t what I said!”

“Then what’s the big deal? Most exciting things just seem that way until you do them a few times.”

“Oh man…” //Holy shit, I am genuinely thinking about going along with this. What has my life become!?//

“Don’t be such a sour-puss,” Rhea admonishes you. “I guess you’ll just have to give in and suck a few dicks.”

“That isn’t helpful, Rhea.  //At all.//”

“Haha.  It’s like a...a… what’s that like, uh //special// word that means the word is like a story…?”

“A fucking //metaphor?//”

“Yeah, it’s like, totally a metaphor!”

//Oh my god, Rhea...//  “I am such a moron.  I never should have asked you for advice.” //I know she is just trying to help, but being around her is distracting… Never mind the fact she might be corrupting me!//

“Well you get it anyway. Honey, life is like a dick--when it gets hard, fuck it!”

“Guh…” //Sage advice, Rhea...//

“Alright! It’s all settled then. [[Meet me at seven at the Broadmoor Hotel and I will make some introductions for you.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2059" name="Meet me at seven at the Broadmoor Hotel and I will make some introductions for you." tags="" position="2850,12650" size="100,100">You meet Rhea outside the “hotel” which appears to be an office building of some kind.

There are no indications of what may be inside except for a small greyish placard reading, “Platinum Palace.”

Rhea greets you with a kiss and leads you inside. With a single look around the lobby, you quickly determine the true purpose of the premises. The girls wearing sexy costumes and bunny ears seem to confirm your suspicions.

“You work...at a //brothel?//” you hiss at Rhea.  You had low expectations but the hotel is clearly a front for an organized sex trade of some kind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bbunnies.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Rhea pouts her lips. “Hey!  Don’t get all judgy before we even get inside!  This is a high class place!  It is //very// high dollar per hour work that is exclusive to fine ladies like ourselves.  You can’t really blame me for taking advantage of my looks, can you?  I do it every day!” Rhea says with a laugh and a flirty flip of her golden hair.

“Do people really do this kind of stuff?” you wonder.  Rhea seems to think her “job” is nothing out of the ordinary. You find both sides of the transaction to be a bit weird. 

“Of course!  Even Julie has made some extra money in her first year of school and she was //very// popular!” Rhea informs you.  “At least before she got that high end “waitress” job.  But if she wants to make a quarter as much and work ten times as hard, that is her choice!”  Rhea glides forth while giving you a tour, her every movement a sensual display.  “Personally I like easy money…[[because I am easy!]]” Rhea jokes.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2060" name="because I am easy!" tags="" position="3003,12743" size="100,100">“Yep, you’re super easy alright, Rhea,” you reply with a smirk.

“Hah, shut up! You weren’t exactly difficult to rope into the sack either. If you’re working and feel the urge strike you, go for it and have sex if you want. I won’t judge.”

“Eh??” You don’t quite like where the general conversation is headed.  You decide to preemptively put your foot down.  “I am not going to have sex for money! I feel bad enough ripping off desperate guys, but at least they can afford it.”

Rhea raises an eyebrow.  “They aren’t getting ripped off. Taylor, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.  You’re hot so I bet you can make a decent amount of money by just sitting with lonely old dudes and drinking coffee with them.”

“You make that sound easy, but do I even want to do that?  Hanging out with old, lonely creepers for money isn’t my idea of a good job.”

Rhea looks incredulous. “What is?  All jobs kind of suck.  If you want to go be a coal miner for a fraction of the money we make, be my guest. I doubt they’d hire your petite ass though.”

[[“I don’t know, Rhea…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2061" name="“I don’t know, Rhea…”" tags="" position="2852,12793" size="100,100">“At least finish the tour and have a drink with me.  They give the girls a large tab.  We can’t, or //shouldn’t// get shit-faced but the open bar definitely encourages us to have a good time.”

“Well, kind of hard to argue with a free drink with a beautiful woman,” you reply, much to Rhea’s delight.

You and Rhea enjoy several drinks. For a couple of hours, you forget you are inside a brothel.

While Rhea leaves to use the washroom, you admire the upscale decor. //I guess this place isn’t totally awful...// you concede.

“Hey, Taylor,” Rhea’s whisper startles you.  “There’s a guy over there that is really interested in you.”

“Huh? So?  Tell him to fuck off!”

“I can’t do that!  He’s a client...a //really// rich one.”

“So?”

“Well...because you were sitting with me he kind of thought you worked here...and then he sort of requested you for a show.”

“Kind of?  //Sort of?//  What the hell, Rhea!?  I do not fucking work here and I never will.”

“Oh don’t be grumpy.  That fellow’s attention should be flattering.”

&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; you flatly reply. 

“And you don’t have to even touch another person! Just //slchlick slchlick. Ching-ching!//” Rhea then proceeds to make obnoxious cash register noises while gesturing at her crotch.

[[Ask how much you would hypothetically earn.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2063" name="Ask how much you would hypothetically earn." tags="" position="3002,12895" size="100,100">“Five hundred for thirty minutes,” Rhea whispers in your ear.

You blink twice. “//A thousand an hour!?//”

The absurd sounding amount of money warps your boundaries.

Twenty minutes later, you are standing in a suite’s bathroom with Rhea. She hands you a pair of panty hoes.

“You’ve got to please the client,” Rhea says.

“I am having second thoughts.”

“No one knows who you are. It’s like you have a secret identity. You have nothing to be embarrassed about.”

//Rhea makes a lot of sense sometimes...//

“But what if something bad happens?”

“It won’t. This establishment has rules. Plllluuus- I will be your //chaperone//. I will make sure nothing shady happens.”

With Rhea’s assurances, you let her take your clothes off. She pushes you out into the bedroom wearing nothing but your stockings. You feel exposed, [[like the epitome of awkwardness.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2064" name="like the epitome of awkwardness." tags="" position="2848,12945" size="100,100">To your surprise, your “client” is a pimply faced young man holding a camera. His jaw drops nearly to the floor when he sees you. 

“You’re sooo cute!” beams the young man, his eyes shining with lust driven admiration.

“I know, right?” Rhea agrees. “Taylor is brand new and super shy. You are getting this service super cheap!”

You instinctively cover your breasts and vagina with your hands.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taystockings.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your client is speechless so Rhea speaks for him. “Don’t be a prude, Taylor! How about some light petting? Just pretend we aren’t here,” Rhea advises.

//She wants me to just start masturbating?// “Ahh… I can’t do that!” //Being watched is embarrassing enough but the camera’s presence makes matters even worse.// For some inexplicable reason, the thought of this interaction being saved for posterity is almost as [[arousing as it is terrifying.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2065" name="arousing as it is terrifying." tags="" position="3000,13050" size="100,100">You stand awkwardly in front of the client as he aims his camera at you, aiming the lens between your legs.

“I’d help you out, Taylor, but this strapping young man only paid for you. Don’t disappoint us!” Rhea urges you.

After appraising your client, you doubt he has a lot of friends to show his video to. //Besides I am basically an entirely new person right now...// If someone would have offered you the same amount of money to jack off, you probably would have accepted in a heartbeat. //I am a girl now, so I guess that’s okay… or really fucking weird… or both...// [[You wonder if your rationalizations are legitimate or merely dressed-up excuses.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2066" name="You wonder if your rationalizations are legitimate or merely dressed-up excuses." tags="" position="2846,13091" size="100,100">You could just leave but you feel rooted to the spot. “Ahh…” //I guess I will just pretend this guy isn’t here and focus on Rhea...// Your fingers probe deeper into your sodden flesh. Before you know it, your movements have quickened in a natural impulse to pursue greater pleasure.  

//Schlick…//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/camshowad.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

//Ah, fuck! I am masturbating for an audience!//

The man with the camera is suddenly much closer to you.

Your state of arousal only deepens as you withdraw two wet fingers connected by a single strand. //Damnit! What the fuck has gotten into me?!// No matter how quickly you move your fingers, you have an internal itch you can’t //quite// seem to scratch.

With an almost psychic level of timing, Rhea suddenly throws two dildos onto the bed.

“Ummm…” You bite your lip, eying the toys with more trepidation than curiosity.

With one dildo plunging inside you and the other rubbing your clit, you masturbate until orgasm. You cum hard on a fake plastic dick, in front of a nameless man and his camera while Rhea whoops with delight.

The man with the camera thanks you and departs while you burn under a halo of shame fueled embarrassment. Masturbating felt great, as did earning money, but the tradeoff clearly has a steep mental price.

[[“What about my money?”]] you ask Rhea once you are alone.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2067" name="“What about my money?”" tags="" position="3000,13200" size="100,100">“We got to talk to my boss first. He will like you, I am sure!” Rhea assures you as she leads you past two goons wearing suits into a small office.

A slender elderly man with a bald head and thick glasses rises from his seat as you enter.

“Hello, I am the proprietor of this establishment,&quot; he introduces himself without giving a specific name. &quot;Rhea informs me you are interested in joining our little organization. You clearly have the looks necessary… but are you as discreet as you are beautiful?” he wonders.

You decide to keep your answer brief to demonstrate understanding. 

“Yes. I can keep a secret.” //I can’t believe I am getting interviewed for a job like this...//

After answering a few basic questions and exchanging some banter with the man, he appears to warm to you.

“I think you will like it here. Most girls start off slow and go at their own pace. You are welcome to negotiate with clients and keep any gifts, but who you spend time with and what you do with them will always be up to your discretion.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good to know.&quot;

“For your first week you should take it easy.  I recommend starting out slow and steady and build up some experience before the weekend,” the proprietor advises.  “But if you want to dive right in that is fine with me too.”

[[Start immediately and earn some extra money and experience]]

“I like your initiative. Rhea, ask Ms. Diaz to find some easy starter work for your friend.”

Your “work” doesn’t seem like a real job. You sit with an elderly gentleman for two hours while he regails you with stories of past exploits. The stories don’t make a lot of sense, but the man seems content to have someone to speak to, although you say little in reply to his frequently outrageous claims.

With a $200 credit earned without being groped, you feel your optimism rise. [[Maybe the black hole you seem to have stumbled into isn’t bottomless.]]

Even though it seems almost impossible, you have made the better part of a thousand dollars. Stepping into a dark corridor on the way back to the front, you collide with a second body and are thrown to the ground.

You land on your ass. //Hard.//

“Are you alright, miss!? I am so sorry!” apologizes a voice so familiar it sends shivers down your spine.

A strong pair of hands pulls you to your feet. As your eyes meet, you feel a hundred mental pillars crumble into dust. There is no way to hide your surprise. //No. Fucking. Way. This is impossible!//

You have come face to face with //&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; Roux.//  Apparently your fucking father frequents brothels. You haven’t seen him in months and meeting him under these circumstances is just too much for you to take. 

Nothing makes sense any more except your burning desire to get the fuck out of there. “Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!” you scream while running away with your [[father’s confused shouting trailing behind you.]]

Mr. Terrance forces you backwards, pressing a vibrator against your pussy while verbally and physically abusing you.

Your head is forced into the cushions. You are spit on and slapped but the worst indignity of all frightens you to your very core. //Bob forces you to feel good.// The vibrator&#39;s engineered pleasure and Bob&#39;s persistence forces you into a new frontier of discomfort as your body begins to heat up and your pussy… //No! I can&#39;t think about this!//

You bite down on the gag. &quot;No way…&quot; you whine as the pressure within you builds to the point of inevitable release. Although you want to do nothing of the sort, you orgasm hard, sending your petite body spasming like you have been tased with a cattle prod.

&quot;Mrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!&quot;

After he forces three more oppressive orgasms on you, Bob leaves you bound in a pool of your own juices.

With only your rumbling stomach and overactive imagination to comfort you, you soon feel like absolute shit.

You stew in terror until Bob returns a short while later. [[He shackles you to a low sitting table while you shake like a terrified animal.]]

He pokes at your genitals and spreads your pussy apart. At your new level, your ass and mouth are parallel to the ground, raised about three feet, just enough for easy access. You have been arranged like a cruel sex prop.

Bob walks around to your rear, inspecting your assets on display with an approving whistle. 

With a slap on your ass, Bob continues, “I saved the best moment for when you are awake. It&#39;s //so much more satisfying that way!//” 

//Slap!// &quot;Mmmmpgaah!&quot; you cry as your ass cheeks begin to sting as he rains down a succession of loud blows to your tiny, round behind.

Your captor continues to ramble pure insanity in your ear while molesting you. &quot;Since this is a new chapter of our life together, I think you need a new name.

Mr. Terrance suddenly grabs the flesh around your hips and pulls you towards him. He pries apart your thighs and inspects your intimate places. He stares for a few moments, but quickly loses self control. His disgusting phallus recharged, he positions himself to mount you. Tensing up, you try to look over your shoulder but the restraints prevent you from doing anything except hurting your neck. You can feel Bob rubbing his penis on your vaginal lips and labia, teasing and probing but not entering you. Despite every fiber of your being wanting to resist, you feel your body preparing for sex.

&quot;You&#39;re making my cock wet. Your cute little ass is made for fucking!&quot; decides Bob. His cockhead coated with a little bit of your juice, he presses upwards until it came to your asshole. Your terror levels max out.  //What? NO! NOT THIS!//

Bob presses forward, penetrating your constricted anus from behind. You feel like you have an iron bar pushed inside you. Although Bob is unable to get too deep, you still feel utterly violated. 

&quot;Mwaaaaahh! Hnnngggghh….&quot; //This is so fucking disgusting and wrong...//

Suddenly Bob withdraws and disappears from your perception. With no other choice, you wait. “Sorry, Maggie,&quot; he apologizes. &quot;I just had to lube up. This is what you get for teasing me all day! I will give you exactly what you deserve!”

Again, you feel him at the base of your anus. You breathe in sharply through your nostrils as the old man pushes forward. A penis plunges into your ass. Your tight ring yields to Bob&#39;s well lubricated and determined thrusts. After an agonizing few moments, you have his entire length inside you. //There is a fucking dick in my ass!// Bob leaves you impaled for a long time. “Remember this, Maggie!” he says to you. 

He then begins to pound your ass. He fucks you tirelessly for nearly an hour until tears stream down your face and fluid down your legs. Emitting whimpers after each thrust, you feel your sense of self slipping away. //Why am I getting raped by an old man? How did this happen to me?// you wonder as old Bob ejaculates inside your asshole.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bunkerrape.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Bob is not content until he violates you in a hundred different ways.

He forces himself on you, raping you endlessly until you feel like you have been held captive for eternity.

After a brutal fucking, Bob tosses you aside.  

&quot;Your bad attitude has returned,&quot; your master chides you. &quot;Here is a little something to help you remember who you are,&quot; Mr. Terrance says as he injects a syringe into your buttcheek.

As the strange chemical circulates through your body, you feel your pain fade away. Bob takes advantage of your compliant state to rape you into an even deeper sense of submission.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ldrugged.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You endure, content to fade away during the worst moments. While Bob may control your body, you refuse to let him have your mind. You retreat into a place deep inside yourself.

You can&#39;t help but perk up. Your stomach rumbles and your mouth fills with saliva when you sight the chocolate. //Nooo! What the hell is wrong with me?! Mmm… chocolate… but it is covered in… stuff… I definitely can&#39;t eat that!//

//Guuurgle.// Your stomach growls. 

The only thing you have ingested aside from water lately is //semen.// You feel sick, and doubt the tiny amount of calories in the foul fluid is enough to lift a tea cup.

You had long ago passed the point of fantasizing about food. Now some was right in front of you, covered in something you have already tasted.

//I have to eat… I can&#39;t just die here. But maybe that&#39;s better. Bob can rape me but he can&#39;t break me!//

&quot;But...&quot;

//Guuuurgle.//

Bob watches your internal debate with amusement.

&quot;I can&#39;t…&quot; you decide, your eyes never leaving the offering.

&quot;Are you sure? If you eat these I will let you join me for dinner tonight. How does that sound?&quot;

&quot;Ahhh….&quot; You are conscious of your shrinking stomach. You can feel your already feeble strength diminishing even further.  //I can&#39;t waste away! I am weak enough as it is!//

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2077" name="Eat Bob&#39;s chocolate" tags="" position="15132,11377" size="100,100">The prospect of a good meal tips your mental scale in favor of accepting Bob&#39;s perverted demands. Like most of your decisions since arriving in this hellhole, you realize you never really had a choice at all.

&quot;Ahh… Fine… I will do it.&quot;

You extend your tongue and are greeted with a fishy tang. Seeing no point to prolonging your torture, you scarf down both tainted chocolates in a big mouthful.

&quot;How does my special treat taste?&quot; Bob asks you as you struggle to swallow.

Luckily the peanut butter overpowers the other //flavors.// You are left with an aftertaste that makes you immediately want to gargle with mouthwash.

&quot;It was fucking gross…&quot;

[[&quot;There is more where that came from,&quot;]] Bob answers.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2078" name="Refuse to eat the chocolate" tags="" position="14837,11428" size="100,100">Being forced to do something is one thing, but you have a choice now. Some precious calories are hardly worth a priceless sense of self worth!

Your anger reaches a boil. &quot;Fuck you, Bob! You are one god-damned sick motherfucker! I hope you get brain cancer //and// dick cancer!&quot; you shout at Bob.

Bob listens to your tirade of cursing until a vein pops in his forehead. Amazingly, he doesn&#39;t beat you but simply picks you up under his arm like a log and carries you away, kicking and screaming like an unruly child. He throws you into a dark room and slams a thick iron door shut, grunting at you to [[&quot;think about your actions.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2079" name="&quot;think about your actions.&quot;" tags="" position="14835,11634" size="100,100">Taking Bob&#39;s words to heart, you reflect on your actions. Perhaps your ineffectual resistance is only worsening an inevitable transition but the fighter in you refuses to give up. 

Unable to sleep, you stare at the ceiling and notice a green rectangle. //Is that an air vent?// The vent is tiny compared to others in the bunker you have seen. Your sense of curiosity rising, you climb onto a shelf and follow the alluring smell of fresh air.

//Damn, if only I was a bit smaller maybe I could climb out of here!//

You take another deep breath from the vent. //I can smell… pine?// Your hopes soar.

&quot;Help! Help!&quot; you shout into the vent. &quot;Helllloooooooooo! Can anyone hear me!? Please! Helllllllloooo! Anyone there?!&quot;

No matter how loud you yell, there is no reply except the desperate echoes of your own voice.

Day and night blur into a single unit of time within the underground. Your internal tally of time begins to fray. You would feel hopelessly trapped if not for the fresh air. 

//That vent is my lifeline to the world!//

Your optimism wavers as your rational brain chimes in several objections.

//I don&#39;t even know where I am… No one is ever going to find me! I have to get out of here myself!// 

Every night you cry for help and [[every morning you wake in the same predicament with tear stained eyes.]]

While gorging yourself on weiners and beans, you are forced to listen to Bob&#39;s plans for the future.

He calls you Maggie repeatedly, altering between treating you like a daughter and a wife. Either choice is weird enough but alternating between the two makes you feel like you are living through a bad horror film.

&quot;... and that&#39;s why we are going to have sex every day. The purpose of life is procreation. We must repopulate the brave new world!&quot; Bob concludes a particularly lengthy sermon.

You snap. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have your baby! That is fucking disgusting! What is wrong with you?! You know what? FUCK YOU!&quot;

Bob listens to your tirade of cursing until a vein pops in his forehead.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lfullpussy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
The reminder of biology makes you cringe. //Ahh… his sperm is swimming around inside me… SICK!// It is bad enough you are being used for Bob&#39;s cruel perversion but being forced to have his children is a scenario so fucked up [[it makes you briefly consider suicide.]]

The older man is also cautious and cagey, so you doubt you will be able to trick him.

After an hour of racking your brain, the best idea you can come up with is biting Bob&#39;s penis the next time he forces you to blow him. //And then he breaks my neck… Game over! Fuck! I am so screwed...//

You find it nearly impossible to keep your hopes up. Each time you fruitlessly climb to the vent it seems to sap a bit more of your willpower away.

[[Climb to the vent]]
[[Conserve your strength]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2083" name="Climb to the vent" tags="" position="15026,12026" size="100,100">You decide that even a futile action would be better for your mental health than stewing in depression. On sore, shaking limbs you climb back up to the vent.

Cupping your hands around your mouth to direct the sound, you shout for help. &quot;Heeeeeeeeeelllp!&quot; You scream until you become hoarse.

No one answers. Angry and defeated, you begin to claw at the metal grating covering the vent. &quot;Why is this happening to me!? I am too young to die in a fucking hole in the ground!&quot; you sob.

Suddenly a child&#39;s voice echoes through the vent. &quot;Helloooo?&quot; 

It takes a couple seconds for your mind to make confirmation. &quot;Oh thank fuck! HELLLLLLLLLP!&quot; you call back.

You press your ear against the vent to listen for a reply.

&quot;How did you get trapped in this little pipe? Are you a faaaaaaaaaaairy?&quot; asks the voice.

&quot;No! I am not a fairy! I am //trapped!// I need help!&quot;

There is a long pause. &quot;I don&#39;t think my parents will believe me,&quot; the boy&#39;s voice answers, sounding far from confident.

&quot;Has the world been destroyed?&quot; you yell up the vent.

&quot;Um, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;I knew it! Fucking Bob, that liar!&quot; //This might be my only chance to GTFO of here. I have to choose my words carefully...//

There is a lengthy silence after you stop speaking. &quot;Ooookay! I will tell them. They never believe my stories though. Even the true ones,&quot; the boy adds, his sad voice softly echoing through the vent.

//Uh oh. He&#39;s my only fucking chance!// &quot;Wait!&quot; you shout repeatedly but there is no reply.

//If they call the police, I will be rescued but then what… obvious questions about me will be asked… A whole shitload of hard questions I don&#39;t have the answers to. That is definitely an upgrade from where I sit now, but what about all the other crazy shit I am involved in? What am I supposed to say, &quot;hey, an evil corporation turned me into a genderbent loli, please don&#39;t call any medical professionals or let anyone know?&quot; Ughhh...//

&quot;Miss Fairy, are you still there?&quot; wonders the boyish voice.

&quot;Yes, just a second! Please just wait!&quot;
 
//I need to bribe this kid and get a message to… Oh fuck, who can I even call for help?// A dozen bad options flash through your mind.

There is only one contact choice that makes obvious sense: the man partly responsible for your current condition.

Your offer of a reward clearly excites the other speaker. &quot;Alright. I think I can do it,&quot; the boy decides after a moment

You pass along Damien&#39;s address and, amazingly, your potential rescuer seems to know of the general area. You force him to repeat the message five times. After a few last words of encouragement, the kid departs. 

&quot;Oops… I should have asked where we are. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter as long as someone finds me. But finally, a potential way out!&quot;

That night you are too excited to sleep. When your captor comes to use you, there is now a fresh gleam of hope in your eyes. You endure Bob&#39;s touch for another day, confident he will be in cuffs by nightfall. 

Instead, you are the one that is bound to a rail while your captor attempts to fuck you into submission. The day passes by with no interruptions to your awful routine within the bunker.

Bound to the wall, you endure a thorough round of seeding. Bob rails your tiny cunny with such violence that, despite your clenched fists, you nearly cry out.

With Bob&#39;s manhood pressed against your deepest internal recesses, he lets loose a massive load of sperm into the back of your uterus. He convulses on top of you, his spasming cock filling you to beyond overflowing.

//If this keeps happening to me… I will definitely break...//

With Bob&#39;s sperm inside your womb, you pray that you won&#39;t become pregnant. A repugnant thought enters your mind: perhaps salvation rested in having a child.

//I can&#39;t do that! Even if he leaves me alone temporarily I don&#39;t want to give birth! I am so small it would probably rip me apart...// With thick, white semen still dripping from your freshly used pussy, [[you realize you have no choice in the matter.]]

&quot;Yes I am! I am sooowy! I just can&#39;t help it. I am sorry, Tammy!&quot; Craig wilts before your eyes. You are unable to determine if Craig&#39;s regret is an act. Your instincts call at you to crush his throat.

//Wait ... what the hell!?// You do a double take as you look at your arms. They have swollen from //toned at best// to //female boxer.//

Your rage reaches a boil as you stare at Lucas’ smug face. You pass the point of giving any fucks whatsoever as long as you can bring down Lucas with you.

You maintain a tense standoff while the temperature in the room begins to rise. Your anger smoulders at maximum intensity until you begin to feel hot. 

Lucas’ amusement vanishes, gradually replaced by alarm. He begins to tug at the collar of his jacket. “How did it get so stuffy in here!? Agghh… W-what i-s h-ap-ppennning?” Lucas gasps as he grabs at his throat. “I am… suffocating!” he wheezes while his phone begins to shake and flash alerts. 

“AAAAAAaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhgahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” You wail as your anger goes nuclear, feeding on itself in a mad loop until you are content to let it consume you.

Lucas picks up his phone. “PH-99 overload? How is this possible? The sensor is at a hundred! The only ones who have access-- Wait-- //you have the Avant Series!//” Lucas speculates, his words resounding as if he had just made a great discovery.

//PH-99? That’s right! If I can make him suggestable, I just might have a way out of this nightmare! C’mon magic pheromone powers, I need you now!//

You feel a bit like a witch doctor, willing your voodoo against an evil man. Your elation rises as Lucas breaks into a sweat and slumps over. //Yes, I have got him! More! More of whatever the fuck I am doing! Yes! This is going to work!//

Your soaring hopes are crushed when Lucas raises his head, laughing uproariously. [[His demented mirth cuts your confidence to ribbons.]]

I have decided that I will polish you and keep you forever.”

//This insufferable prick!!!// “RAaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!” You feel your muscles throb. The urge to pummel Lucas into paste is nearly overpowering. You feel like a great river held back by a flimsy dam.

“Wow. Your stature is growing! Fantastic!” Lucas remarks with the interest of an academic taking notes. “Hmm… why are you looking at me like that?”

“DIE, ASSHOLE!” You shriek as you lunge towards Lucas, fist poised to strike.

“Green eggs and ham! Disarm!” Lucas cuts you off with an unusual phrase that makes your head spin.

Your hand makes it within an inch of Lucas’ nose before your target stops you. You slump to the floor like a robot with a dead battery.

//Nooo…. Not this shit again! I have to do something quick!//

“I just had a wonderful idea!” he announces. “Despite your irrationality, I appreciate your spirit. You are obviously special. You’re too good for the others. I will make you into my own personal servant. I will do you the great honor of crushing your will without the use of the chip. I want you to beg me to become my slave!

“Umm…”

Lucas grins at you like a madman.

//This guy is even crazier than Deter!// “I refuse,” you answer immediately.

“You will see reason eventually,” Lucas replies, sounding unconcerned. “Now, since you went through the trouble of filling this room with pheromones, let’s have sex, shall we?”

“HUH!? NO! I’d rather bathe in acid than do it with an old creep like you!”

Lucas shrugs as if your opinion is inconsequential. “To be crass: I am going to fuck you anyway.”

“Eh!? That’s your big plan? Rape me into obedience? That is fucking stupid! Lucas, you’re a sick piece of shit. You can rape me but //you will never break me!//” you shout your defiance.

“How did you get infected? Where did you gain access to Transfigure?” Lucas asks you.

“I don’t know.”

“Hmm. What do you think of Deter?”

“I think he is a fucking prick.” You glare at Lucas as if to say, “You too.”

“Ohhh I will love stealing that light from your eyes. Your resentment is palpable but I will transform it into adoration before long.”

“Gross. Who would love an old toady like you that cares more about money than anything else?”

Lucas’ eyes sparkle. “I don’t care about money. Money is a marker, mere points for ambitious men. It is what it buys that counts. What I, the great Lucas Ferret, value the most are my// toys.//” 

You swallow nervously. //His… toys...//

“What about your new body?”

“What about it!?”

“Do you think that you are attractive?” he presses. You nod. “How many times have you masturbated since your transformation?”

You feel your face flush as Lucas steps into your personal space. He reaches for your face and you attempt to swat his hand away but you find your strike is harmlessly deflected.

“Huh?! I thought you said no more mind control!”

Lucas scoffs. “This isn’t mind control! You are just //weak!//” He grabs your arms and forces them effortlessly to your sides.

After a bit of futile struggle, Lucas petrified member points directly at your defenseless pussy.

“Don’t worry. We will both enjoy this,” he assures you. Mr. Ferret grins down at you puts his penis against the wet center between your vaginal lips. From your position, the awful cock looks impossibly large. This is the most surreal moment of your life.

You grasp at any straw capable of repelling Lucas. “Please, I am man! You can’t do this to me!”

“Yes I can. All I see is a sopping wet pussy attached to a stupid cunt that will soon be my slave.”

“That is never going to fucking ha-APennnnnnaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Your protest turns to a wail of pain as Lucas forcefully squeezes his cock into your pussy that is clearly not meant to take anything near his size. //No way! This can’t be happening!// “Aeeiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Aeeeeeeeeeirrrrrrrrr…. Ohhhhhh….” your cries fill the room as Lucas literally rips your hymen apart to fill you with his manly girth. “N-no….” you whimper in shock as you watch Lucas’ manhood disappear inside you surrounded by a trickle of blood.

//Please, please, please! Taylor! Wake up from this nightmare!// “Unnngghhh…. Hnnggahhh!” 

Lucas’ large cock thoroughly plows your furrow. Your whole body shakes with the intensity of his strokes. The shock of pain transitions to pleasure with astonishing speed. It is like your body has a mind of its own.

//I can’t stop this… I am being raped!// “Ahhh! Nooo! Stooop it!”

Lucas laughs at you while his dick surges in and out of you. //Fap. Fap. Fap. Fap. Fwaap!//

//Kickass!// &quot;Ha! I pick, //Mega Blazers//!&quot; //I am awesome at that game!//

Unperturbed, Craig grabs the game and loads it up.

As you smirk at Craig, certain of your victory, you notice a giant fucking //Mega Blazers// poster in the corner of Craig&#39;s room.

Your heart sinks. //How the fuck did I miss that?!//

As soon as your match begins, it is clear you have underestimated Craig yet again.

You wage an epic duel among the stars. After a valiant struggle, your blazer is destroyed by a cheap-shot missile.

Your battle took so long, it is hard to request a rematch with a straight face.

//Did I fucking transfer to some parallel reality where I suck at games?!//

Craig turns to you and puckers up.

&quot;I want the first kiss right now!&quot; Craig insists.

//Damnit, how could I be so stupid?! I have to think of something!//

Yet in thirty seconds of frantic thinking, the best idea you come up with involves mitigating the awful experience as much as possible.

[[Try to mitigate awfulness.]]
[[Take another few seconds to think.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2102" name="Try to mitigate awfulness." tags="" position="4960,18061" size="100,100">//Maybe I can get away with just a light peck on the cheek...//

&quot;Okay, fine… I… I will kiss you on the cheek, okay? But you can&#39;t tell anyone about this. EVER. Got it?&quot;

Craig nods.

&quot;Even this is too much, it just isn&#39;t appropriate...&quot; //Fuck, what am I doing?//

Craig&#39;s slightly uneven eyes narrow. &quot;But you said you would!&quot; he protests before quickly moderating his tone. &quot;Okay. You can kiss my cheek. But I want a long one!

&quot;A long one?&quot;

&quot;Thirty seconds!&quot;

You pucker up and press your lips into Craig&#39;s cheek. //One one thousand, two one thousand...// you begin mentally counting.

Craig&#39;s cheek is slightly sticky and tastes faintly of maple syrup.

//This is fucking gross… When was the last time this guy had a shower?//

Thirty seconds feels closer to thirty years but eventually the moment expires.

Craig&#39;s face is now bright red. He shifts uncomfortably into a sitting position.

&quot;I want the next one right here,&quot; Craig informs you, [[while tapping his lips.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2103" name="Take another few seconds to think." tags="" position="5146,18058" size="100,100">//I can&#39;t just fucking kiss Craig, that would be pure insanity! I just need to stay calm and think… Think… C&#39;mon Taylor! Craig is like a devious child in a man&#39;s body… Wait! That&#39;s it!//

&quot;Alright, Craig. You win!&quot; you announce your defeat to Craig.

The young man begins to almost vibrate with jubilance- until you cut his celebration short.

//This is way more than he deserves, but whatever!// &quot;So here you go, Craig! Three kisses!&quot; You blow three kisses to a stunned Craig. 

&quot;W-What!? That&#39;s //cheating!//&quot;

&quot;No it isn&#39;t. I promised you three kisses and you now you got &#39;em. Now do your fucking homework and give me my damned clothes back!&quot;

You watch as Craig deflates before your very eyes. &quot;They are under the bed,&quot; he says as he slumps over. &quot;Uhhh…. Waaa….&quot; he sniffles as he sits down at the desk. He looks back at you and you glare at him until he starts on a worksheet with pencil in hand.

&quot;But I like you!&quot;

//Err… What am I supposed to say to that?// &quot;I uh, like you too, but not in that way.&quot;

Craig wipes a tear from the corner of his eye. &quot;I just want to know what it feels like to kiss a beautiful woman! Just once. My life… //isn&#39;t good.// Everyone hates me. I just… just… want to try it once before I die. I know nobody would ever want to kiss me but when I look at you, I-I I //really// want to. Please, Tammy. It doesn&#39;t have to be for long.&quot;

You feel sorry for Craig. As creepy and messed up as he is, he is still a young man. You can relate to his sexual frustration. For a minute, you almost forget that he was attempting to blackmail you.

Shaking your head, you refuse. &quot;I can&#39;t!&quot;

Craig pouts. &quot;Why would you go back on your word?&quot;

//Fuck, he really knows how to hit where it hurts...// &quot;You really want a kiss from me that badly?&quot;

Craig nods like an enthusiastic bobble-head.

&quot;And you will stop being a bad boy?&quot;

Craig keeps nodding. //I bet he is harmless if I charm him a bit… Being a babe has its merits I guess.//

Craig puckers up and shifts beside you on his bed. //Except there are downsides to everything...// 

//I will just give him a quick little peck… Like pulling off a band-aid, nice and quick! Let&#39;s get this fucking over with!// You fight off the nauseous feeling you have, [[leaning forward to press your lips against Craig&#39;s.]]

&quot;Yeaaaoooraaggaaa!! Your lips are //sooo// soft!&quot; Craig immediately responds with full force, as if trying to devour your mouth with his own.

//Sluurp shloop!// Craig sucks on your face and you just go limp, letting him do what he wants.

He takes advantage of this, grabbing the back of your head to make out with you with such intense desire it horrifies and excites you.

//No way! This is way too intimate! Why the fuck am I kissing Craig? Why can&#39;t I kiss a cute girl like Samantha?// Instead of the babe you dreamed of, you are making out with a chubby young man with the mind of a child.

Craig eagerly explores your lips.

You try to back away but Craig holds you in place. &quot;Mmmmaahh! Mmmm….&quot; You attempt to give Craig thirty seconds but the strange act makes you flustered. You and Craig are both inexperienced kissers but you find his sloppy mouth to be disgusting. Your faces awkwardly bang together. You can smell cheetos on Craig&#39;s breath. You feel like you are about to be sick.

//Maybe if I close my eyes that will be better...//

You do just that and find it helps immensely. 

&quot;Mwaaahhhahh…&quot; //Ahh… How long have we been doing this? Has it been ten seconds or ten minutes?//

The young man covers the bottom half of your face with saliva. Just when you are about to call a stop to the whole thing, [[Craig jams his tongue deep into your mouth.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2106" name="Craig jams his tongue deep into your mouth." tags="" position="5096,18359" size="100,100">&quot;Gaaahhh!&quot; you sputter as you shove Craig away. &quot;What the hell, Craig?! Don&#39;t just fucking French-kiss me!&quot;

&quot;But I wanted to try all the kisses with you,&quot; an unabashed Craig responds.

&quot;Ahhh… That isn&#39;t what we agreed on!&quot;  //Fuck, I feel all hot and tingly… and like I need a six hour long shower!!// &quot;That definitely counts as more than one!&quot;

Craig&#39;s face turns into a stormcloud. &quot;No it doesn&#39;t! You promised!&quot;

You sigh. &quot;Fine! Let&#39;s get this over with!&quot;

&quot;I want a good one! A long kiss.... Right here,&quot; Craig says while gesturing at his groin.

You are momentarily stunned by Craig&#39;s bold request. &quot;EH!? No fucking way…&quot; //This is going way too far! Why does this keep happening to me?! How do I get myself into this shit!?//

&quot;You prooooooooomised!&quot; Craig whines. 

&quot;Not that! You want me to … kiss … //your thing!?//&quot;

&quot;Yes please!&quot; Craig pulls down his pants before you can utter another word. &quot;My pee-pee gets so hard when I look at you!&quot; Craig says while exposing a shockingly large cock.

&quot;Whoooa!!? What are you doing?!&quot; you shriek.

//Holy shit his dick is ENORMOUS!// Craig was clearly blessed in the pants. //Why can&#39;t I look away? A better question is why the fuck am I still in this room?!//

[[&quot;I want a thirty minute kiss here!&quot;]] Craig repeats his request, with the addition of a time limit.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2107" name="you fall into near silence." tags="" position="8994,15349" size="100,100">Powerless to stop him, you let Lucas flip you on your stomach. He is back inside you a second later. You feel every inch of Lucas’ significant girth.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/steady.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//If he keeps fucking me like this-- ahhh… I will definitely go crazy!// 

“I haven’t fucked such a great pussy in years. You’re gripping me so tightly… Ah, Taylor, I will make you into a real woman!” Lucas declares. The lean older man then doubles the pace of his perverted actions until you feel your sense of self slip away.

Despite your internal panic and immense discomfort, it isn’t long before you orgasm with Lucas’ phallus surging inside you.

“Haha! You’re tightening up even more! Your slutty body wants my semen, why can’t you just admit it?”

“That’s not true~!” Your voice quavers.

He paints your insides white as your nearly black out.

To your horror, your virgin pussy clamps down on Lucas’ cock and coaxes out vast quantities of semen.

Your womb and love canal is splashed with warmth as your pussy overflows with milky semen that dribbles onto the sheets.

You have never felt so used and humiliated. “Ahh… You’re a sick fuck. You won’t be able to… break… me… like this...” you whimper defiantly as possible. //As long as I hold on a chance to escape has to appear!//

You and Lucas engage in a brief staring contest. The executive smiles. “Hmm, still not ready to give in? You have an impressive stock of willpower, Mr. Roux. Too bad even the hardest subjects can still be broken. I have all the time in the world. You, not so much. [[I bet you dream of my cock tonight!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2108" name="I bet you dream of my cock tonight!”" tags="" position="9149,15447" size="100,100">“I hate you so much right now.”

Lucas yawns. “That only makes this more enjoyable. You will get over it.”

You aren’t so sure. Your scars from this ongoing transformation nightmare are already deep. Certain the worst is yet to come, you begin to fear that the cost of survival will be too great to bear.

Your captor and two giant guards force you down a dark corridor and into a windowless cell.

“Get off me you fucking creeps!” you yell as the two men hold you in place while Lucas snaps a thick collar on your neck. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucascollar.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Noooo! I don’t want to wear a collar! I am not a fucking dog!”

“Correct, you’re my slave, not a dog. [[I actually respect dogs.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2109" name="I actually respect dogs." tags="" position="8997,15497" size="100,100">Although you hiss and kick, your arms are eventually bound behind your back. The restraints feel indestructible.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucasbound.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//This is even worse than being in prison!//

The guards leave and Lucas proceeds to molest you until a knock alerts [[you to the presence of a newcomer.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2110" name="you to the presence of a newcomer." tags="" position="9149,15599" size="100,100">“Ahh! Good timing. Taylor, this is Victoria, she is one of our //special directors//,” Lucas says, introducing you to a stunning young blonde woman with sharp blue eyes and a sly smile. Her scattered moles and beauty marks do nothing to mar her exceptional good looks. When she enters the room, she seems to suck half the oxygen right out of it.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victoriaentrance.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Victoria bows before you, or Lucas rather.

“Maaaster! Thank you for calling upon me!” she cheerfully gushes. “I have been waiting for so long~!”

“Victoria is one of my favorite toys,” Lucas elaborates when he sees your shocked expression. “I thought she could help introduce you to your new way of life.” With a yawn, Lucas checks his phone. [[“I will be back in a few hours.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2111" name="“I will be back in a few hours.”" tags="" position="8997,15649" size="100,100">Victoria rushes over to you. “You’re so lucky!” she coos. “I divide my life into two chapters: before and after I met Master. You are in for a treat! Your life is going to going to become its //highest possible form.//”

Victoria’s intense blue eyes give off the fervor of a zealot. Still, your words are the only weapons you have left. 

“You don’t have to do this. Just help me escape, we can go to the police!” you beg.

Victoria looks down at you with pity. “Escape? You’re not listening!”

“Please, I will do whatever the hell you want, just get me the fuck out of here!”

“That’s a bit better. I like the obedience part. You will do //exactly as I say!//” The atmosphere in the room suddenly changes.

“W-Whaaat!?” You instinctively shrink back. Victoria appears before you, looming impossibly large. Radiating danger, she exudes an aura of imperious command like a sixty foot reincarnation of a goddess of war.

One second you are fine, the next, you are more terrified than you have ever been before in your life, including all recent events. Lucas was awful but what you are experiencing now is nearly beyond comprehension.

[[“Breathe, my dear!”]] Victoria urges you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2112" name="“Breathe, my dear!”" tags="" position="9149,15750" size="100,100">You realize you have been holding your breath. You need air. Fulfilling Victoria’s command is merely incidental as you gasp to refill your shuddering lungs.

The world slows to a crawl as you inhale Victoria’s perfume. The spicy, upbeat fragrance of lilacs and freshly cut grass fill your senses.

You go from terrified to intoxicated in a handful of heartbeats. When you look up at Victoria, you realize she is the most beautiful woman in the world. There is no way such a woman could ever lead you astray.

The young woman brings her lips close to your own. You thrust out your chin, suddenly desperate for a kiss.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victaykiss.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
When your lips meet Victoria’s, you suddenly feel completely content.

“Mmmmm! There, isn’t that better? Your pheromones may have a degree of potency but //I// at least know how to use mine. Now listen closely. You realize it is a great privilege to be chosen by Master, right?”

You smile happily at Victoria as you nod. //It was so nice of her to help me… Help me…what? Help me become Lucas’ slave!? WHAT THE FUCK?!//

If your hands were free, you would have slapped yourself.

Your mind feels foggy, but it is clear Victoria is a dangerous adversary.

Victoria leaves you alone, bound in a puddle of sweat with Lucas&#39; cum leaking from your pussy and the most alluring fragrance imaginable wafting through the air.

At this rate, you doubt you will survive another day [[waiting for a chance that may never come.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2113" name="waiting for a chance that may never come." tags="" position="8994,15800" size="100,100">The next morning, your torment resumes.

Lucas continues raping you with astounding stamina.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/corporaterape.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Even though Lucas is an older man, he possesses an insatiable libido. It would almost be impressive if you weren’t on the receiving end of his perversions.

It is impossible to ignore the hot cock inside you but you do your best to do just that.

Lucas uses you like an Onahole. Every time he ejaculates copious amounts inside you, he is soon recharged and back indulging himself with your unwilling body.

As awful as the realization is, your body //reacts// without your consent. To lessen the pain, your body naturally lubricates itself. 

“Gr… Agh… Hah.. hah… huh…” you pant. “How can you keep doing this? You’re an old dude!”

“I have several performance enhancements. I have the virility far beyond a young man!” he explains.

Lucas delights in your discomfort. Urged by on by your red face and heavy breathing, Lucas continues to rail you faster and faster until even your efforts to mentally detach fail. You can no longer pretend to [[ignore the penis invading your body.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2114" name="ignore the penis invading your body." tags="" position="9146,15898" size="100,100">While pressing against your uterus, Lucas pauses his movements to undo your restraints.

“Hunnnghhh…” You moan, impaled on the old man’s dick. Having your arms free does little to lessen your discomfort.

Sex is supposed to be pleasurable… maybe that’s why a tiny, invasive sliver of pleasure is growing within you with each passing day.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/penrubpen.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas grabs your hips and forces you to ride to his cock. Having sex with Lucas is bad enough but to do it face to face in such an intimate manner is even more humiliating. You turn away from Lucas’ [[hot breath and ever-present smirk.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2115" name="hot breath and ever-present smirk." tags="" position="8994,15944" size="100,100">Your captor forms a steady rhythm of penetration. You stare at the ceiling, willing yourself to be anywhere else.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucastrance.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After a small eternity, you look down, noticing, //Lucas Ferret has removed his hands.//

Your empty stomach clenches into a tiny ball. “Noooooo!” //How long have I been moving on my own?!//

“Hahaha, Taylor! Your instincts have taken over. I knew you were a slut at heart.” With that, utterance, [[Lucas unleashes all his sexual frustrations on you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2116" name="Lucas unleashes all his sexual frustrations on you." tags="" position="9146,16046" size="100,100">You find yourself thrown forward. Bracing yourself on all fours, Lucas mounts you again.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucasdoggytraining.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Something hard pokes against your asscheek and then it finds its way into your sopping pussy.

“Hnnngghh…”

Lucas tries to fuck you into oblivion while you attempt to maintain a grip on your sanity. Sex with with the old man feels good but it hurts your very essence to admit it.

After you are broken in, [[Lucas again leaves you alone in your cell overnight.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2117" name="Lucas again leaves you alone in your cell overnight." tags="" position="8994,16100" size="100,100">“Oww… Eww…” You touch your sore, puffy vagina and wince. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cpussy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
The next day, Lucas resumes raping you at dawn.

At the end of your ordeal, you are carted off to a lab where you endure a fresh battery of painful tests.

Although he doesn’t elaborate, Lucas is clearly impressed with the results and redoubles his efforts to train you into some kind of corporate sex doll. Of course you resist but you find your actions to be ineffective. Inevitably you get fucked for hours and, instead of experiencing the full extent of what Lucas is doing to you, you retreat into a place deep inside the recesses of your psyche. Here, detached and safe, [[you hide while your body is repeatedly defiled.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2118" name="you hide while your body is repeatedly defiled." tags="" position="9142,16190" size="100,100">Lucas uses you as his personal cum dump for a week straight. Still, you hold out a vain hope for escape.

You feel your iron-clad willpower decay a tiny bit with every session. Even your dreams become tainted. You are perpetually sore and covered in cum. You begin to wonder if you will make it out of this alive.

//But even if I do… How am I going to forget //THIS!?

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taypronebone.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you cry as Lucas rails your prone body.

“I want you to feel every inch of me!”

“Unnnghhh…” //It is impossible not to...//

Lucas forces his cock as deep into you as possible before filling you with his horrible semen. Just when you think things cannot get any worse, the old man starts kissing your cheeks and neck. In a moment of delirium, your lips touch.

After using you, Lucas leaves you on the couch in a convulsing heap. Incapable of standing, you turn your red face downward into the cushions. 

“I am going to kill you, Lucas,” you whisper under your breath.

“What was that?”

“I said I am going to fucking kill you!” you repeat, much louder. You are certain the world would be a much better place without Lucas Ferret in it.

[[Lucas looks at you with dull, reptilian eyes.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2119" name="Lucas looks at you with dull, reptilian eyes." tags="" position="8994,16244" size="100,100">The next day, Lucas arrives outside your cell early. He tosses you a tiny black dress and you put it on, eager to cover your nakedness. Lucas watches you dress with unfeigned interest. He leads you to his private suite.

“Taylor, this week you came countless times with my penis inside your vagina. Every day you orgasm more frequently,” Lucas recaps. “Surely you have seen reason and wish to swear to become my servant? I Will make you feel pleasure a thousand times greater.”

You spit in Lucas’ face.

Unperturbed, Lucas wipes his cheek. “Your conversion is inevitable.”

“Like hell it is!”

“Did you enjoy the sex we had on any level? Taylor - honestly now.”

Your mind reels. //On ANY level…? Of course not!//

“Yes, I enjoyed the sex,” you answer robotically, not quite believing the words spilling from your mouth. “Ahh! You asshole! You said you wouldn’t use the chip!”

“I lied.”

“You bastard!”

“It gets worse I am afraid. I have made a few adjustments to your body in order to make you a more suitable servant. The more sex we have, the more compatible we will be! With every semen deposition you will fall further under my control! [[Eventually you will crave it, and I will let you have as much as you want!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2120" name="Eventually you will crave it, and I will let you have as much as you want!" tags="" position="9142,16338" size="100,100">“The only thing I want is to watch you fall down a very large flight of stairs! I hope you break your fucking neck.”

Lucas ignores your outburst. “Now that your pussy has gotten used to your master’s shape, it is time to train a different hole.”

“Ahhh… A different hole? Ummm…” You feel a nervous apprehension coalesce in your guts.

“What do you think we should do first?” Lucas asks, apparently wanting you to decide between oral and anal sex.

You balk. “Neither! Fu--”

//Slap! Whack! Slap!//

Lucas smacks you around and then drags you down onto his lap… and raging erection.

“Well, you’re still a little bit too feisty so I can’t risk you biting my dick. So I guess we are on to your asshole training next until you learn to be a good little slave.”

“Fuck off, you maniac! I--” Your protest dies as you feel something hard press against your anus. You break into a cold sweat. //No way… I am a guy! This isn’t supposed to happen to me! I am going to be fucked in the ass and there is nothing I can do about it!//

On shaking legs you attempt to stand. Lucas lets you rise, [[hands hovering over your hips.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2121" name="hands hovering over your hips." tags="" position="8994,16396" size="100,100">He points to the kitchen island. “Hands on the table. Head down. Ass up,” Lucas delivers his request like a fast food order. 

You give Lucas a dirty look that you’re certain conveys your opinion.

//Whap!//

Your tormentor gives you one more hard smack across your cheek. He then grabs your shoulders and spins you around, forcing you to bend over the table.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucasslap.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
A grunting Lucas pulls up your dress and slaps your ass so hard it echoes through the room.

You look back in disbelief as Lucas lines up his huge penis between your buttcheeks.

“No!”

“Yes!” Lucas counters. [[The next instant, you are struck with a lightning bolt of pain.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2122" name="The next instant, you are struck with a lightning bolt of pain." tags="" position="9142,16490" size="100,100">“Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggahha!” you cry as Lucas shoves his fat, bare cock balls deep into your virgin asshole.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucasanalinsert.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After a moment of painful discomfort, Lucas begins to move. 

“How does it feel to be taken from behind by a real man, Taylor? Ahhh, your mind and body belong to me!” Lucas grunts as he sodomizes you until only your muffled yelps remain.

The executive strokes your pussy as he works his engorged cock in and out of your ass. The double stimulation plays havoc on your senses.

“Ahhh… Ahh yeaaaooow!” you cry out as Lucas begins to run an experienced finger in circles on your clit as he penetrates you. After a few minutes, Lucas withdraws a glistening finger and holds it in front of your nose. You are forced to inhale your own scent as Lucas wipes your secretions all over your face. Although you are humiliated, you attempt to stoically endure. //This is so uncomfortable. It hurts! It feels so wrong... So why are my genitals betraying me?//

//Whap. Whap. Whap. Whap. Whap!//

“Hwaaahhh…” The sounds and unflattering smells of your sex fill the kitchen. The odors mingle and nearly make you sick. “Ahh… It stinks! It’s dirty! Stooop it!” Worst of all, [[is the fact your abuse doesn’t feel entirely awful.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2123" name="is the fact your abuse doesn’t feel entirely awful." tags="" position="8994,16540" size="100,100">You take an anal creampie, feeling hot, viscous fluid spill into your rectum. The older man withdraws his spent manhood. He then spends a moment to enjoy working his overflowing seed into the throbbing flesh around your anus.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/analpie.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You lie in a pool of sweat until you finally walk back to your cell under Lucas supervision. You move with a pronounced limp under a cloud of shame.

With every aching movement, [[you are reminded of your defilement at Lucas’ hands.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2124" name="you are reminded of your defilement at Lucas’ hands." tags="" position="9142,16634" size="100,100">For the next few days, Lucas keeps you at his suite, constantly fucking you in the ass during every waking moment. He gives you no respite, determined to break you into submission with the powers of his body.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/corporateanal.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!” you wail during your abuse, finding the utterance helps distract from the pain.

A primal mix of power, pain, and subdued pleasure form a strange emotional cocktail. Even though Lucas is focused on your butt, you feel a dull tightness in your vagina. You can feel yourself //leaking// down your thighs.

//I don’t know how much longer I can take this...//

“Just fucking kill me, you sick fuck!” you shriek at Lucas.

He looks at you like you are insane. “I don’t want to kill you! That would be such a waste!”

Lucas’ cock swells inside you. He redoubles his efforts to fuck you into silence.

“Noooo-oooo-ooo!” your cries are broken by the collision of your butt against Lucas’ pelvis. [[You feel the vibrations in your very core.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2125" name="You feel the vibrations in your very core." tags="" position="8998,16688" size="100,100">
“I am going to train your asshole until you beg me to use your pussy instead!” Lucas asserts.

//My butt hurts so much! I can’t take this anymore!// “I…”

““Love getting ass fucked so much I don’t want you to switch to my pretty pussy?”” Lucas finishes your sentence for you. “You’re such a pervert!”

//I am a pervert… But… This isn’t something that would turn me on… Aghhh! Then why the hell am I so warm!?// You feel like your mind is being warped. “No! Ahh! Your dick… is…”

“Is what?”

“So big… Ahhh…”

//Fwap. Gwap! Frap-fap-fap-fap-fap!//

“And you’re already accustomed to it! Look at how easily your body accepts it! You take dick like a champ, Taylor. You have a body truly made for sex!”

“Waaaaaaaaaahhhh! Fuuuucccckkk!” you wail as Lucas goes into overdrive, pistoning in and out of your ass with such speed that your perineum is pelted with weighty testicles.

You realize that your pussy feels oddly empty. It is a vacancy that inexorably longs to be filled.

[[Tell Lucas to fuck you in your vagina]]
[[Endure as stoically as possible]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2126" name="Tell Lucas to fuck you in your vagina" tags="" position="9147,16846" size="100,100">Something snaps within you. Your feeling of longing tips the scales in favor of accepting Lucas’ proposition.

“Ahhh, that’s enough! Please! If you’re not going to stop, just fuck me in my pussy then!”

“Oh? Hahaha!” Lucas’ laughter is sickening. “You finally ask of me a request I am capable and willing to grant!”

Lucas pulls his cock from your butt with an audible pop. He then rams it to the hilt, burying it deep inside your pussy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucascouchf.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas pounds you hard with his pistoning cock, until he dumps a huge load into your womb.

//Ohh… Why did I tell him to do this!? What kind of fucking compromise is using my pussy instead of my ass!?//

Lucas kisses your sweaty forehead. “Ahh! That was satisfying! I have some work to catch up on though! [[I will be be back soon.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2127" name="Endure as stoically as possible" tags="" position="8849,16844" size="100,100">//I won’t play his games!//

You remain silent. Lucas chuckles. “I have no qualms cumming up your butt. Your ass is prime! Now take my dick!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/analdef.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas’ fucks your asshole without reservation. You are soon thankful that you go partially numb. You almost detach yourself enough that you can barely feel Lucas’ dick surging in and out of your asshole.

“Ahhh! You&#39;re tightening up! I am cumming!” Lucas groans while his cock bulges and releases a torrent of cum inside you.
 
After a few more half hearted thrusts, Lucas withdraws his dick from your puckered asshole. 

“Ahh! That was satisfying! I have some work to catch up on though! [[I will be be back soon.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2128" name="I will be be back soon." tags="" position="8993,16990" size="100,100">After your particularly brutal night, Lucas breaks from the established pattern and leaves you alone.

You try and sleep but find your dreams to be tainted. You have a nightmare where you suck Lucas’ cock. Waking up with a wet pussy is uncomfortably confusing.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/leftalone.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Haaah… Fwaahh… Have I … become accustomed to this life already? Damnit! Masturbating as a girl feels so good...”

As you near orgasm, Lucas’ face flashes in your mind.

“Uhhnnn…” You shudder as you cum. As soon as the endorphins recede, you feel like absolute shit.

[[“What’s happening to me!?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2129" name="“What’s happening to me!?”" tags="" position="9141,17048" size="100,100">Lucas wakes you bright and early.

“Don&#39;t you have work to do?!”

“I cleared my schedule. Training you is fun and of possible benefit to the company. I think you’re going to love your new home at Trans Corp, Taylor!”

“Why the fuck would I work for you assholes!? AHHeeh!” You yelp as Lucas a finger down your pants and into your pussy.

“See? You’re warming up for me.” Lucas withdraws a wet finger from your groin and tastes the fluid. “I can already smell you as soon as I entered the room. You’re like a bitch in heat.”

“No I’m not!”

“Mmm… What a superb, bold flavor! Your love juice is like nectar!” Lucas remarks as he savors your taste. “Hmm, I wonder if there is PH-99 in your secretions as well? I will have to test that later.”

Your time as Lucas’ plaything passes by slowly. 

One day, instead of using you, Lucas sits you down at his kitchen table.

“I have almost run out of time to play with you. This is your last chance to submit without consequence. If you continue to choose the path of obstinance there will be serious repercussions. It is dishonorable for you to let your family and friends pay for your mistakes,” Lucas threatens.

Your willpower stocks may be low, but your hate for Lucas is in near infinite supply.

//Now he threatens my family?// What choice do you have?
[[Categorically refuse.]]
[[Submit to Lucas’ demands.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2130" name="Categorically refuse." tags="" position="8994,17194" size="100,100">“I REFUSE!” you scream. As the words leave your mouth, you feel like you are being electrocuted. Your head hits the floor and the world fades to black. Your last coherent thought is one of sadness and loss. You are certain you have been killed...

Until you open your eyes yet again. Feeling groggy and disoriented, you struggle to rise. Your limbs are stiff and shaky. //What the fuck just happened? I was knocked out and… OH SHIT!//

Your vision focuses on the room’s //other// inhabitants.

The insufferable Lucas Ferret stands at your side with a cadre of scientists. You blink twice, noticing Lucas now has a small beard.

“You have been asleep for just over six months,” Lucas casually informs you. The claim is delivered with such an offhanded nature that you believe him. “Your will is still your own, for now,” Lucas explains. “You will voluntarily submit to me and become my slave.”

You scoff at Lucas’ prediction. “Like hell I will! FUCK YOU! Putting me in a coma for six months, if that is even what you did, hasn’t changed //shit//! Nice beard by the way! You look like a homeless man in a suit.”

“Ahhh, Taylor! That //spark!// Breaking you will bring me great joy. I came up with several elaborate methods of crushing your spirit, but in the end there was one clear winner given your personality type. I am afraid we have reached the point where your punishment now extends to others.”

You grit your teeth. //He has to be bluffing… He wouldn’t really hurt my family, would he?// After a moment, you realize Lucas is capable of anything given what he has put you through.

“If you hurt my family I swear to fucking god I will burn this entire place to the ground and throw your corpse on the pyre!”

Lucas gives a short laugh, like a refined version of a snort. He directs your attention to a nearby observation screen.

A young woman with red hair sits in chains. You recognize her almost immediately and your heart nearly shatters into a million pieces.

“What!? //Samantha!?// What have you done to her!?” You find yourself gasping for breath. As long as you were personally responsible for the consequences of your actions, you felt you could fight Lucas. Now, with Sam imprisoned in a Trans Corp dungeon, you know Lucas has beaten you.  At least for now.

//Sam...//

“&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Samantha&quot; &quot;Sam desc&quot;&gt;&gt; is my newest employee! Hmm… Now, I wonder what sort of job I should issue her? [[Do you think she prefers anal or vaginal intercourse?” Lucas wonders.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2131" name="Submit to Lucas’ demands." tags="" position="9144,17257" size="100,100">You find the fight against an inevitable conclusion to be too exhausting to sustain.

//I will just lie… Anything is better than this bullshit!// “I give up.” 

“Hahahaha! And just like that, even the greatest fire dims to the ash of impermanence!”

After a battery of fresh brainwashing, your lie is twisted into glorious truth.

Your master has shown you truth and given you pleasure. On this basis, you swear yourself to Lucas’ service. The words bind and consume you until only your master’s words remain.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/readyformaster.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You wait out your days as patiently as possible, ready to serve your master at a moment’s notice.

&quot;E-everyone gets to have a girlfriend except me! It isn&#39;t fair. Tammy, except for Sophie you&#39;re the only girl that has ever been nice to me. I promise I won&#39;t say anything about all the stuff that has happened if you give me my ...exper-ience! I just want to try! I am so curious. I won and I deserve it too,&quot; he concludes.

The combination of blackmail and pity is a potent remedy for your inaction.

Feeling possessed, you kneel down in front of Craig at his computer chair and cradle his significant boner in hand.

&quot;I am not doing this for thirty fucking minutes…&quot; You say while giving Craig a few soft strokes.

&quot;Kiss iiiiiit!&quot; Craig urges.

&quot;Ughh… gahhh…&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigew.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Ewwwwwwwwww! What a gross, smelly thing! He smells like squid! Sick! Doesn&#39;t Craig ever bathe?//

With a hard member in hand, the sheer [[fucked up enormity of your task hits home.]]

Your lips cover Craig&#39;s weeping dick, giving it a salty kiss.

&quot;That&#39;s it… YES! Oooooooh!&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigew2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The soft, springy flesh seems to imbued with a thick, manly smell.

&quot;Fuwaah… Mmmgumphah… Mwah...&quot; //Half an hour of this?//

&quot;Kiss it all over!&quot; Craig requests. He thrusts his balls forward. You have already crossed a hundred critical lines, so your common sense appears to be disabled. Since you are already kissing a penis, [[the distinction of going further seems to be blurred.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2134" name="the distinction of going further seems to be blurred." tags="" position="4948,18569" size="100,100">Confused by your sudden curiosity, you kiss the underside of Craig&#39;s shaft and plant your lips on one of the young man&#39;s testicles.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigewballkiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Craig looks down at you with a look of pure contentment and bliss. &quot;Tammy, your kisses are the best!&quot; he compliments you.

//I can&#39;t believe I am kissing this fucking guy&#39;s balls… The world is a messed up place...// you silently reflect.
As you take a momentary breather, Craig grabs the back of your head and [[pushes you down onto his precum covered glans.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2135" name="pushes you down onto his precum covered glans." tags="" position="5096,18659" size="100,100">With that movement, your lips eclipse the head of Craig&#39;s penis and it goes right into your mouth. Before you can suitably react, Craig begins to hump your face. His penis hits your tongue and the inside of your cheek. You have lost control of the situation.

You gag and sputter until Craig slowly releases his grip. You are left with a saliva coated dick in front of your face. It is obvious you have already gone far beyond the point of no return. With minimal urging, you lower your head back down.

&quot;Fwaahh… Shit…&quot; //I am doing it...// &quot;I am sucking a dick…&quot; //Craig&#39;s dick...// You never intended to suck any dicks in your life, let alone //Craig&#39;s//.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigew3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//If I get him off this will all be over a lot sooner...// You probe Craig with your tongue and recoil at the rancid, salty taste. You begin to wank the young man off, hopeful it will speed the process.

&quot;Fuck, how long has it been?&quot; You look at Craig&#39;s alarm clock in shock. //Four minutes!? This is awful...//

You are so distracted that Craig undoes your bra before you can slap his hand away. It is amazing how losing such a small amount of clothing can make you feel so exposed.

&quot;What? I am helping! Now continue the kiss!&quot; [[Craig insists.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2136" name="Craig insists." tags="" position="4952,18713" size="100,100">Your mind feels cloudy. //I agreed to this shit… I guess it is just something I have to do.// Sucking Craig&#39;s weiner is just a means to an end.

Every second with Craig is a struggle of endurance.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigsuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Arhgh gwarble!&quot; //I am gagging on Craig&#39;s cock, this is the lowest moment of my life!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigsuckeyes.JPG&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaah! You&#39;re looking right at me! Wah, I feel sooo good! I am going to squirt out my //juice// for you, Tammy!&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t you fuckin&#39; dare--AGHhh!&quot; Craig forces his dick inside you. His pulsing cock erupts in your mouth, [[covering your palate with foul bitter fluid.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2138" name="covering your palate with foul bitter fluid." tags="" position="4952,18861" size="100,100">&quot;Hwaaahhh… It is in my mouth...&quot; //Craig&#39;s semen...//

//A taste a man&#39;s, er //nobody&#39;s// tongue should ever touch…// The distinct flavor will forever be marked in your memory.

You wipe off a handful of cum from around your lips but Craig jams your fingers into your mouth.

&quot;How does my juice taste?&quot; he asks you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigtaste.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;It tastes like… //failure,//&quot; you reply.

“You’re a //REALLY// good kisser, Tammy.”

Craig’s attitude pisses you off but your anger is [[eclipsed by a sudden reemergence of your common sense and ability to taste.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2139" name="“Guys! Get ahold of yourselves!”" tags="" position="409,14198" size="100,100">“Huuuuaaahh!” Drew emits a muffled cry that sounds like it came from a wounded walrus. The pillow, and presumably Drew’s hand, begins to vibrate, rising and falling more rapidly.

//Are they really that turned on by me? This is so fucked up! These guys are supposed to be my best friends!// As you look down at your own movements, you find it difficult to blame them. //I am only showing them because they are my friends!//

With distracting pleasure, you look away and when you hear a creak, you are surprised to see Evan has moved closer. //A lot closer.// Your best friend is now three feet away, staring into the center of your exposed pussy.

“Evan! W-What are you doing!? Get back!” you protest.

“Oh come on! What’s the point of showing us but not letting us have a good look?”

“This is embarrassing enough as is!”

“Evan! Wait! Aieeeeeeeee!” you protest in vain as Evan grabs control of the dildo impaled in your pussy. With one fell swoop, he seizes complete control of your body.

[[“I just want to make you feel good!”]] Evan dumbly asserts as he begins to fuck your pussy.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2140" name="“I just want to make you feel good!”" tags="" position="553,14300" size="100,100">“Evan, let go! Ahhhhhhh!” you screech at Evan as the dildo seems to hit a wall inside you. You call out in pain but your friend mistakes your cries for lust. Two of your puny arms fail to hold back one of Evan’s. He continues to force the dildo in and out of you until raunchy sounds, smells, and juices spill from your pussy. “Get… off… me!”

“After we get off, sure,” Evan answers between breaths. You want nothing more than for Evan to stop but that desire is soon eclipsed by feelings beyond your control.

You turn desperately to your last hope for salvation. [[“Drew! Help!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2141" name="“Drew! Help!”" tags="" position="413,14350" size="100,100">Although Drew’s eyes are clouded, he rises from his seat while awkwardly holding a pillow over his groin. Evan looks back at Drew with confusion. “Drew? What are you doing?”

“We need to stop!” Drew emphatically replies while swaying slightly. Both of your friends are acting //drunk.//

Evan chuckles, an element of madness creeping into his laughter. “I-//we// can’t stop! Look, Drew! Look at her!” Evan says as he moves aside, giving Drew a prime view of your feminine real estate.

Drew freezes while the rest of the world seems to as well. Your best friend’s line of sight focuses on your dripping intimate parts. You feel woefully embarrassed.

Drew’s desire to help you is quickly replaced with a different sort of desire.

//Oh nooooooooooooo! Why did I do this?// 

Gripping the bed sheets, you are forced to endure Evan plunging the dildo in and out of you.

A dull pressure builds inside you until its inevitable release.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you nearly scream as your body is pushed into orgasm.

In your moment of vulnerability, Evan whips out his cock right in front of your face and you nearly go cross-eyed. “Evan! Put that //thing// away!”

[[“Aren’t you curious?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2142" name="“Aren’t you curious?”" tags="" position="553,14448" size="100,100">“No! I had a dick for my whole fucking life. I am not interested in yours!” Evan’s idiocy is more than alarming.

Evan frowns. “Well you already got off so I am going to finish then,” Evan decides.

“What?! Don’t! That isn’t what we agreed! Don’t you dare fuckin’ touch me!”

“Fine, geez. You’re kind of buzzkill now that you’re a chick.”

“Shut up, Evan.”

//Fap. Fap. Fap.//

“Yeah… I’ll… shut… up.”

“Ew…” You turn away from Evan, not wanting to see your friend jerk off.

You listen to the lewd sounds Evan is making with growing embarrassment.

[[“Ahh, I’d love to put this inside you,”]] Evan murmurs.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2143" name="you realize you have no choice in the matter." tags="" position="14923,12342" size="100,100">&quot;Please let me out! I swear I will never say a word!&quot;

Bob shakes his head. &quot;I can&#39;t, Maggie! It is for your own safety. If you leave the bunker, you&#39;d be irradiated and //die//. I can&#39;t have that.&quot;

&quot;What about your buddies!? Did they die too?&quot;

&quot;My buddies?&quot;

&quot;The creep brigade that helped you abduct me!&quot;

&quot;Oh my //associates!// The prepper community is deeply intertwined. We are merely waiting until the opportune time to open our doors and reunite. It is prudent to weather the storm in multiple bunkers for redundancy purposes. But with this much tuna, popcorn, and cute girls, well, who would blame us if we enjoy the wait?&quot;

&quot;They have girls too? Is this some kind of prepper sex trafficking ring!? I knew you survivalist weirdos were crazy!&quot;

&quot;Hah! You&#39;ve got a smart mouth on you for a little girl. What good is the end of the world if you don&#39;t enjoy it? I love you, Maggie. You will make great children for me!&quot; 

Bob&#39;s words stick in your mind. //Make… children...// You gulp nervously and try and think about other things but there aren&#39;t many distractions inside the sex bunker.

Your hopes of rescue dwindle with every passing day.

There is no sign of any other life outside your little bubble. You become depressed and increasingly resigned to your pathetic existence as an old man&#39;s toy. Bob is determined to get you pregnant and with enough intercourse, you fear it just may happen.

You suppress a shiver and silently pray that scenario will never come to pass.

[[With no way to tell the time underground, your days blur into one.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2144" name="With no way to tell the time underground, your days blur into one." tags="" position="14781,12443" size="100,100">*Several months later…

During dinner, Bob produces a can of cherries. He sets the prized ration down on the table with a loud //clunk//. 

Your eyes lock onto the can. Your mouth waters despite yourself. You have been underground so long you&#39;d probably eat a barbecued rat without complaint.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cherry.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
Bobby T gives you only a single cherry, forcing you to eat it off his calloused finger. Snatching the can away from you, he greedily eats the remainder by himself. 

Within mere minutes, as if by karmic decree, you hear a loud gurgling noise and Bob begins to groan and rub his belly. He then rushes to the washroom, leaving you alone, unrestrained and unsupervised for the first time in what could only have been months. 

Instead of seizing your freedom, you hesitate, feeling paralyzed by fear. The longer you spend in the bunker, the more difficult it is to resist Bob&#39;s orders. Besides, there is nowhere to go and the bunker is practically indestructible.

You sit your chair thinking of potential consequences, [[knowing that as bad as things were they could easily get worse.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2145" name="knowing that as bad as things were they could easily get worse." tags="" position="14925,12497" size="100,100">You had long ago resigned yourself to playing the long game in order to escape. You have to take things slow and show no appearance of independence in order to get more information. 

As you run barefoot across the hall in the direction Bob left, your light, soft soled foot falls are almost silent. You pass by the washroom and hear Bob moaning in distress. Smiling at Bob&#39;s discomfort, and silently wishing he gets hemorrhoids and ass cancer, you continue down the hallway, confident he will be occupied for at least a few more minutes. You have a tiny window to do //something//. 

You dart into the main chamber, entering the tunnel at the back that led to Bob’s quarters. You feel a jolt of excitement when you spot the ajar door. As you became more openly compliant, Bob has been increasingly lax with security.

Inside Bob&#39;s room is a large wall of books, assorted furniture, old computer equipment, and a big bed you are more than familiar with. You scan the room and on impulse head to the closet. 

You open it to reveal a number of active computers. You seem to have uncovered Bob&#39;s gaming lair or bunker command. 

In the center of the cramped room is a bucket seat at the command center situated around multiple monitors, with a password screen on display. //Get the password or be trapped with Bob for the next twenty years…?//

Your idea of killing Terrance vanishes. //So much for murder I guess… Maybe there is a way to guess the password. There has to be a clue somewhere! Maybe Bob wrote it down?// In the back of your mind seconds were rapidly ticking down. How long did you have? If Bob catches you, there may never another chance, plus you would likely be severely punished.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2146" name="Search the bunker for clues" tags="" position="15081,12853" size="100,100">You search the desk and table before opening a storage cabinet stacked with cardboard boxes. You grab one at random and began flipping through its contents. You discover a bunch of random clutter from musical scores, to books, bills, and other assorted junk. 

You select another box and find a folder on top of a stack of paper. Inside are photographs. You rifle through them and notice an outdoor theme. There are several pictures of a boat on a lake, one with a young Bobby holding a fish, several of a family camping trip, and then a photo that shocks you. 

In the last picture, Bobby Terrance stands in the center with his arms around a woman, presumably his wife, and a younger blonde girl who is the spitting image of your current appearance. 

&quot;No fucking way…&quot; you remark as you flip the picture over. Written on the back, in big blockish letters is: The Terrance Family - Bobby, Laura, and //Maggie.// 

You feel nauseous as you return everything to its place and turn to leave. You freeze solid as Bob’s silhouette appears in the doorway. “Maggie, where aaaare you?” he calls. 

&quot;Oh shit.&quot;

“What are you doing in here, Maggie? This room is off limits!”

You force down your feelings of terror and attempt to sound innocent. “Is your stomach feeling better?” you ask an irate Bob.

Bobby&#39;s eyes narrow as he presses you, “Answer the damn question, Maggie. [[Why are you in here?]]” Bob&#39;s tone implies there will be hell to pay if he doesn&#39;t like your answer.

Although it sickens you to your very core, you have no choice but to spend the only currency you possess. “I just wanted to warm your bed. I was waiting for you.”

Bobby&#39;s expression softens. After a tense moment, he laughs. “Oh completely ad-dick-ted eh? I will forgive you this one time, Maggie, because you are a sweet girl, but after tonight never come back in here without permission. But, since you are already here...” He walks towards you while pulling down his boxers, his big bouncing cock serving as evidence of his significant arousal.

//I only wish I could say the same thing...// You feel your pussy begin to tingle in anticipation of what is to come. //Uhh… I can&#39;t believe I am getting used to this...//

“Okay, Maggie, be a good girl come here and show me how good you’ve gotten at this...” Bob trails off. He sits cross legged, erection sticking out like a flagpole, begging for some attention.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2151" name="wonder if your little act has gone too far." tags="" position="15077,12990" size="100,100">&quot;That was a good appetizer. Great effort. Now get on the bed. Open your legs. Daddy is coming home!&quot;

You comply. A few seconds later, Bob is surging inside you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbobby.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Hnnnnnggggggggghhahhh….&quot;

&quot;Get pregnant, Maggie! Take it all! I am going to fill your naughty little pussy!&quot;

With legs bouncing in the air, you feel hot spunk splash into your womb.

//If this keeps happening will I get pregnant? If that happens, is it even possible for me to give birth with this tiny body? Ughh… I can&#39;t believe I even have to consider this shit!//

The sound of creaking bed springs fills the room. 

&quot;Your little cunny loves my cum! Say it!&quot;

&quot;Ahhh… My little … cunny loves your cum.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it! I will give you what you deserve!&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/overflow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Ahh… it happened again… I can feel Bob&#39;s stuff spreading inside of me...//

You fall asleep held in Bob&#39;s arms.

He places a hand on each of your butt cheeks and then thrusts his curved cock inside you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbobbydoggy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Hah… huh… How does it feel?&quot; Bob asks you, his hot breath in your ear.

You tell Bob what he wants to hear. &quot;Ahh.. Ah.. Good,&quot; you reply. The only distraction you possess is that of the flesh. &quot;Do me harder, Bobby. Make me feel good~!.&quot;

&quot;I know exactly how to do just that!&quot;

//Fwap. Fwap. Fwap-fwap-wap-wap-wap...//

A couple weeks later, [[you wake up with the overpowering urge to vomit.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2154" name="you wake up with the overpowering urge to vomit." tags="" position="14934,13205" size="100,100">You try and ignore the growing panic within you but eventually your random cravings and frequent morning sickness signal that something is seriously amiss within your body.

Your lithe figure begins to change, your belly swelling with each passing day. All thoughts of escape eventually vanish from your mind. You have to focus on the life growing inside you. You feel utterly trapped but once you accept your limitations you feel oddly free.

Once Bob realizes you are carrying his baby, he warms to you. He gives you candy and frequent treats from the larder.

Unable to bear the thought of harming an innocent child, you resolve to service Bob&#39;s daily needs.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ldaily.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Hah! My life has been amazing since you came into it. I love you, Maggie! Ahhh! Here I go again! I have more cum for you! Ahhgggaaahh!&quot;

You orgasm together, rocking your hips until Bob&#39;s spent cock is soft. Since you are already pregnant, you care less about the repeat creampies.

[[The months tick by, your days are filled with sex and candy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2155" name="The months tick by, your days are filled with sex and candy." tags="" position="15075,13300" size="100,100">You feel a bit like a bloated whale as you haul your ample tummy around the bunker. The strange proportions hurt your back.

The first time you feel a kick inside you, the enormity of your circumstances hits home.  You know your life will never be the same again.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bunkerpreg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Two months after giving birth to your first daughter, Bob plants another seed in your womb.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bunkerpreg2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You have no other choice but to embrace your new life and make the best of it. You can&#39;t change the father of your children but you can help give them a good life.

&quot;We are like Adam and Eve, Maggie! I am blessed to have you and //we// are blessed to have each other.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Bobby!&quot; you agree, bent over your child&#39;s crib while Bob takes you.

You smile down at your newborn infant, glad to see none of Bob&#39;s cruelty in your daughter&#39;s innocent face.

At least you now have a purpose. You hope to find new meaning by being a good mother.

“Huh?! EW! Dude, you’d put your dick in anything. I bet you still have burn marks on your weiner from when you watched //Canadian Pie!//”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evanffinish.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“How about just the tip? Just for a second!?”

“NO!” you yell at Evan as you begin to slowly crawl away.

“Wait! I am almost done!” Evan protests.

//Fap. Fap. Fap. Fap-fap-fapfapfapfap!//

&quot;Uhhhhhhhhhaaahhh!&quot;

Evan blows his load all over the soles of your feet while Drew spooges all over one of your good pillows.

//Oh my god! What the fuck just happened!?//

The haze of lust dissipates, leaving you with an uncomfortable silence. //Wow! All three of us are gross, perverted idiots...//

[[In the aftermath of your orgasms, sanity gradually returns.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2157" name="In the aftermath of your orgasms, sanity gradually returns." tags="" position="549,14608" size="100,100">Drew is the first to speak. “I am so sorry, Taylor! I don’t know what came over me!” Drew apologizes. Where a short while earlier he stared at you with frightening intensity, now Drew barely meets your gaze.

//Fuck, this is totally making our relationship all … complicated.// The mere attempt to think about your potential future invokes a nauseating series of questions.

“You guys need to leave-right now!”

The pair of young men awkwardly shamble away. Evan graciously leaves you a tissue draped over your semen soiled feet.

Once you are alone, you enjoy a hot shower and head to bed early.

You wake up the next morning to the sound of your phone ringing.

“Hello?”

“I found something cool!” Evan announces. “Assemble the team!”

“The team?”

“Our extreme trio,” Evan clarifies.

“Oh, I’ll call Drew.”

Evan refuses to elaborate further until you meet in person. [[You try not to get your hopes up.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2158" name="You try not to get your hopes up." tags="" position="405,14646" size="100,100">“I solved all our problems!” Evan announces once the trio of friends has assembled. He hands you what appears to be a flyer for a tourist attraction.

Your eyes ghost over the incredibly tacky brochure that looks like it came from a gas station circa 1970. “The //Loch Ness Mongoose//? Is this some kind of joke? Evan, please take this seriously! My life is on the line here!”

Evan raises an eyebrow, as if annoyed you don’t see the genius in his unexplained but no doubt terribly weird idea.

“Isn’t the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland somewhere?” you wonder.

“It is in the northern Scottish Highlands,” Drew replies. “Allegedly,” he adds.

Evan rolls his eyes. “Tch! This is a //mongoose.// It is not Scottish. It has no relation to any monster that I know of.”

You have so many questions. “Are mongeese… er mongooses even native to this part of the world?”

Drew shakes his head. 

“Is there even a “loch” outside of Scotland?”

“Your lack of imagination is distressing, Taylor,” Evan chides you. “There is a local legend that if you kiss an albino mongoose around this specific lake region, you will wake up the opposite sex the next day.”

You sigh. “I don’t think that’s what happened to me… I haven’t kissed any weird critters lately. Where did you hear about this?”

“From a reliable source. So, what do you think?”

//Ah, fuck, I feel like I live in the Twilight Zone sometimes...// [[“Evan is there some part of this I am missing?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2159" name="“Evan is there some part of this I am missing?”" tags="" position="553,14756" size="100,100">“Obviously! Last night I was researching gender-bender-legends…” Evan trails off for a second, his face turning a bit red. “Ah, ahem, and this one seemed legit. There is a lake. There is mysterious happenings. There is a white mongoose on the loose. Sounds exciting, I know! All we need is the mongoose’s bones… or boner or something and we grind that shit up and,// bam//, instant gender-bender cure.”

“What the hell, man? I don’t want to ingest a fucking mongoose’s boner. Ick!”

“According to the legend, you //smoke it.//”

You have an urge to face-palm. “You’re obviously high if you think I am going to smoke an animal’s penis.” 

“Very open minded,” Evan says sarcastically. “Ever hear of Chinese medicine? Tiger penis is in everything good, man.”

“Um. And you learned this information where exactly?”

“On the internet! It has never very often led me astray.”

“Uh huh…That is even dumber than believing in Bigfoot,” you opine. 

“Hey, I know it is a long shot but I stayed up all night trying to help you, so maybe be a little bit less of a dick, okay? Plus, I was watching this one show and Bigfoot is probably real.”

“Sorry. I just don’t see how chasing such an unlikely lead could help… I can’t spend fifty years searching out every long shot we come across,” you argue. 

Evan shrugs. “Everything is a long-shot. Existence is a long shot! You already won the lucky sperm lottery and then got transformed… I’d say your whole life is unlikely.”

You and Drew nod along. “Uh huh.”

“So, even if this is nothing, the fresh air would do you good. Taylor, you have been really stressed out lately.”

[[“For obvious reasons!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2160" name="“For obvious reasons!”" tags="" position="303,14798" size="200,200">“For obvious reasons,” Drew and Evan concur.

Evan leans forward and gives you his usual easy-going smile. “Worst case scenario is we have some fun and relax. I will bring a cooler of beer. Besides, it might be good training for our cabin trip. We usually go overboard with the hiking and stuff. I am usually sore for a week after we get back.”

//The cabin trip!? It is already the late fall! I nearly forgot… It is our little tradition. I’d hate to break it off this year despite everything that has happened...//

You take another look at the brochure. “I guess some R &amp; R would be okay,” you allow.

“That’s the spirit!”

“What do you think, Drew?”

Drew bites his lip as he considers a reply. “As much as I liked Nessie as a kid, the monster has been thoroughly debunked. It is highly unlikely this excursion will lead to anything except us getting ripped off by some shady tourist trap.”

You largely agree with Drew’s sober assessment.

“So what do you think we should do?” you press your portly friend.

“I think we should follow up on some of our previous ideas. I do not trust folk medicine.” 

“//Internet// folk medicine,” Evan replies, as if the distinction is significant. “C’mon, lighten up guys! It will be fun.”

Drew frowns. “I would prefer not to chase or be chased by any animals if at all possible too.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2161" name="Pursue the albino mongoose" tags="" position="402,15096" size="100,100">You decide a little adventure and fresh air will do you good. 

A three hour car ride and a hundred dollars spent at a liquor store later, you arrive at a remote lake, apparently known for its bagpipe music and strange wildlife.

Enclosed spaces have made you a bit uncomfortable lately. You are glad to get out of the stuffy car and into the fresh air. 

Evan packs nothing but a big cooler of beer, while Drew hefts a heavy backpack you suspect contains every piece of survival equipment known to humankind. You opt for some light gear, a compromise between the two extreme approaches offered by your friends.

Side by side your best friends, you head off into the woods expecting to find nothing but a bit of adventure and fun in nature.

You keep your eyes peeled for wildlife but, aside from a few birds, see nothing. You hike for hours, until Drew starts to lag behind.

You feel like you are on a wild goose chase. //I guess that is literally true… Different goose, though...//

“At least it is a beautiful day,” you remark as you savor the sounds and smells of the woods. [[The trip has brightened your spirits if nothing else.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2162" name="Check over leads more likely to bear fruit" tags="" position="552,14952" size="100,100">A sensible approach?

Look!” Drew points to a nearby tree.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mongoose.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Holy fucking shit! There it is! Just look at that sly little devil. //Your boner is mine!// My friend needs you!” Evan shouts at the small mammal. 

The goose senses your presence and takes off like a bat unleashed from hell.The three of you impulsively chase the mongoose through the woods. 

“After it!” Evan sprints after the target, diving into the bushes in pursuit.

It darts ahead of you like a wriggling white lightning bolt, stopping for nothing and always finding a path through the seemingly impassable undergrowth.

A few times Evan comes close to clubbing the poor thing with a stick.

“Wait, Evan! Don’t hurt it! I didn’t realize these goose things were kind of cute!” you shout after him.

Evan continues his mad hunt. He manages to corner the rat-like creature in a small hollow. “Bah-ha! Your goose is cooked now, mongoose! Get back here you fucker, you’re not allowed to be white and magical!” Evan raises his walking stick to strike the cowering animal.

“Evan! Stop!” You manage to slow Evan by a few crucial seconds. The mongoose bolts by and disappears within the space of a second.

[[“Why did you let that vicious rat-thing go!?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2164" name="“Why did you let that vicious rat-thing go!?" tags="" position="402,15248" size="100,100">“I’d rather stay like this than go around clubbing seals and shit. Some things just aren’t worth it, you know?”

“I wonder about you sometimes, Taylor.”

“What do you mean?”

“You’re becoming such a softy. I say try everything that has a chance of working. You’re like a cancer patient. You’ve got nothing to lose.”

//A cancer patient with nothing to lose? That’s pretty fucking grim...// “Except my sanity and morals.”

“Uh, guys…?” Drew interrupts your argument.

“What?”

“Where are we?”

You look around, shocked that you recognize no landmarks. Every direction looks exactly the same and there is no indication of the path you followed to get to this location. “Shhhhhhhhhhhiit! We’re so lost.”

“That fucking mongoose tricked us!” Evan fumes.

“Yeah, I am sure that was his intent…”

Drew puts on a brave face and sets a comforting hand on your shoulder. “At least we have each other,” he says.

Evan squints at the darkening sky. “I say we drink this beer and wait it out until morning,” Evan suggests while cracking open a can.

Drew’s eyes dart around the clearing. “What if there are animals?”

[[“I doubt that stupid white rat has friends,”]] Evan replies.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2165" name="“I doubt that stupid white rat has friends,”" tags="" position="546,15302" size="100,100">You sit down on a log and begin to think over your options. A drop of rain hits you on the top of your head followed by a dozen more. A minute later, you are huddled next to Evan and Drew as the sky above rumbles and dumps an ocean of water on top of you.

“We need to make shelter!” Drew shouts above the wind.

“There is no time!” Evan shouts back. The three of you manage to duck behind a big tree to shield yourself from the wind. Drew produces a tarp from his backpack and the three of you just barely manage to create a makeshift shelter in the underbrush. The three of you squeeze into Drew&#39;s pop up, one man tent. You are forced to lie on top of each other in the confined space.

You listen to the rain fall for an hour. “Holy shit! It is not letting up…” The wind continues to howl, blowing with a bone chilling intensity. 

When it gets darker, you can see your breath. You and your friends huddle closer, shivering with increasing violence as the night goes on.

“We need to warm up,” Evan insists as he passes each of you a beer.

Drew straightens up. “Alcohol doesn’t actually warm you-”

[[“Drew, shut up and drink your damned beer.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2166" name="“Drew, shut up and drink your damned beer.”" tags="" position="402,15404" size="100,100">The three of you drink in silence. With nothing else to do, and a long cold night ahead of you, the three of you continue drinking until the cooler is empty.

“I thought of another great way to warm us up!” Evan says as he squeezes your tits.

“Don’t just grab me!”

“What’s the big deal? Holy shit, Tay! Look at your nipples, they are sticking out so much!”

“Ahhhhnnn!” you cry out as Evan teases you. “It is because it is cold out!”

“And you make cute noises too! Obviously you are enjoying this, Taylor. I&#39;m not an idiot, I can tell when a girl likes being touched.”

Drew gulps. “Erect nipples are a sign of female arousal,” he agrees.

“What!? Not you too…” You feel a cold shiver descend down your spine. “We are freezing to death and you guys are thinking about //weird shit//? Geez.”

//Ahh… At least I am not so cold anymore.//

Your huddle grows tighter as Evan pulls you closer. You try and make yourself comfortable enough to sleep.

You nearly succeed, until you feel something hard pressing against your leg.

[[“Evan, that better not be what I think it is.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2167" name="“Evan, that better not be what I think it is.”" tags="" position="546,15446" size="100,100">“Well if you don’t want to be poked, you can always use your hands.”

You balk. “//You// use //your// hands!”

“But we are in the middle of the fucking forest. We are out here for //you//, remember? I can’t leave the shelter. I have to stay here and there is a beautiful woman in front of me, so what else am I going to think about? It is your fault for distracting me.”

“Ew. Your thoughts are your own.”

“No one will know if you give me a handy. Drew and I can keep a secret, right Drew?”

Drew sputters for a moment. “I can keep a secret,” he finally answers.

“Fuck off. Do it yourself.”

Evan changes topic. “The car ride out here was just brutal.”

“Yeah…” Drew agrees.

You shrug. “It wasn’t that bad.”

“Pfft! For you maybe. For us, it was torture! Then we chase a damn rat through the woods all fucking night and you didn’t even want it. Pretty frustrating.” Evan begins to rub his groin. 

//Ziiip!// “Evan, what the hell!?” 

“You told me to take care of it. So I am.” [[Evan begins to jerk off less than a foot away from you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2168" name="Evan begins to jerk off less than a foot away from you." tags="" position="398,15548" size="100,100">“Seriously!?”

“What? Men have needs, Taylor - as you well know. I am just taking care of mine since you are being stingy.”

“Stingy!?”

It is then you realize that as quick as you nearly froze in the rain, the temperature inside the tiny tent has now swung in the opposite direction. You now feel unbearably hot. Evan and Drew clearly feel the same way. With the body heat of three people, the tent has rapidly become a sauna.

“Haha! It is just a handjob. I can keep a secret too, I will carry it to my grave! Maybe we die out here, so that might be soon. I think you have just been //outvoted//, Taylor.”

“You should get out of your wet clothes,” Drew suggests, his voice quiet but firm.

“That’s right, we can’t have you getting sick on us,” Evan agrees. “It is for your own safety,” he adds as he attempts to pull your shirt over your head. Once you are topless, Evan resumes masturbating.

“Why are you such a pig?”

“Because you’re so damn hot! You’re killing me, Taylor! Please //help me,//” Evan begs in a pained voice, while gesturing at his inflated dick.

“I-I can’t.”

“Just take off the rest of your clothes and I will do the rest.”

You feel buzzed, warm, and a bit guilty. You look to Drew, the voice of reason, as if asking for permission. [[He gives you a small nod.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2169" name="He gives you a small nod." tags="" position="550,15598" size="100,100">You peel off your wet jeans and are embarrassed when the smell of your feminine arousal fills the tent.

“Hhhhgfff,” Evan grunts when he sees you in all your naked glory. His hand is soon a blur in motion as he strokes his mighty pole. “Don’t be mad, Taylor. If you masturbate it will help me get off.”

//Here I am, legs open again for my friends… Why am I acting like this!?// You watch Evan fap away and feel a slight tingle spread through your body.

Your hands are drawn to your pussy. Your slick fingers begin to rub the sensitive flesh around your vagina.

“Oh, fuck yeah! That’s it, Taylor!” Urged on by your show, Evan continues stroking himself, moving closer to you with each passing second.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tenthj.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Fap-fap-fap. Schlick-schlick-schlick!//

“Ahh…” //I must be drunk...//

“Taylor!” Evan grabs your hand, pulls you close, and then coils your fingers around his raging erection.

//Oh fuck, I am touching another man’s thing!// “It is so hot… and big… Hwaahh…” //What is wrong with me?//

You give Evan a few soft pumps. You look between your best friends while both watch you with eagle’s eyes.

“Ahh! Damnit!” You give in and start to stroke Evan’s cock, your fingers riding along the loose skin of his shaft.

You fall into a steady rhythm, jerking Evan while fingering yourself. Your own pleasure increases with every deft swirl of your fingers.

“You’re the best, Taylor! Keep going!” Evan encourages you. Jerking faster, you focus on making Evan cum.

A few seconds later, Evan does just that. With minimal warning, his penis bulges and unleashes several massive spurts of cum. He covers the wall of the tent with spunk.

“Ahh, at least that’s over with.”

“Taylor,” Evan interrupts.

“Yeah?”

Evan points to Drew. [[“He obviously wants one too but is too afraid to ask.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2170" name="“He obviously wants one too but is too afraid to ask.”" tags="" position="398,15696" size="100,100">After being so bold and perverted with Evan, you can hardly leave Drew hanging.

“I want you guys to never mention this night again,” you request as you shift your attention between Drew’s legs. //Two handjobs in one night… I really hope these guys appreciate this!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drewrub.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You give Drew the best cock massage of his life. You work your soft hands over his manhood until he is stiffer than steel. Gripping Drew’s base tightly with one hand, you use your other to polish his weeping glans.

“AHH! AHHH!” Drew makes over the top groans of pleasure.

“I know, right?” Evan laughs as he watches on approvingly.

“I-I-I… AHHHH!” Drew cries out as he covers your fingers with cum. With Evan’s scent on your right hand, and Drew’s on your left, you wonder how you will ever forget this night and all its events.

I know that sex and drugs are the pillars of happiness but one is far worse for you in the long run than the other. My suggestion: have more sex and do less drugs.”

Julie’s blunt suggestion makes you uncomfortable. //But maybe she does have a point...//

The problem seems to center around the fact that two of life’s greatest pleasures go best when combined. You doubt it is possible to give up either of your vices.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2172" name="Beg Julie for some money" tags="" position="15546,26098" size="100,100">You bow your head before your sister. “Puuuhleeease? Help me, Julie!”

Julie seems genuinely concerned. “Taylor, are you seriously that desperate?”

You nod sadly.

“Fuck, you should have just said so.” Julie walks to her purse and hands you fifty dollars.

“Thank you, Julie! You’re a lifesaver!”

As soon as the cash is in hand you have a desire to convert it into something “usable”.

After several fervent assurances of your good health, you [[head over to Mitch’s apartment.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2173" name="head over to Mitch’s apartment." tags="" position="15394,26204" size="100,100">Desiring to keep things brief, you dash upstairs and meet Mitch.

You lay your cash down on Mitch’s table. He seems disappointed by your choice of payment. After splitting your purchase between pills and powder, you head to the doorway.

Mitch’s voice stops you before you can step into the hall. “One for the road?” Mitch asks you, calling your attention to a fat line of coke on the table.

“Um…” You bite your lip and consider your options. A small voice inside you shouts at you to run, instead you sit back down at the table, eager for a free pick-me-up. //Except nothing involving Mitch is ever free...//

“Oh well…” //Sniiiiiifffff!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taybump.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As expected, one the euphoria is cascading through your veins, Mitch reveals the hidden strings. [[“We should fuck a bit before you go,”]] he casually suggests.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2174" name="“We should fuck a bit before you go,”" tags="" position="15546,26242" size="100,100">You shake your head while fingering the baggies in your pocket. “Sorry, I have to go.”

“What’s the hurry? You can’t go yet!” Mitch objects. “I haven’t had my fun yet! Besides, you shouldn’t be so rude when I went out of my way and got you something nice.”

“I don’t want anything from you.”

“Except my dick and drugs.”

“Ah… //Obviously// I came for the drugs. Just the drugs.”

Mitch chuckles and rolls his eyes. “Sure you did but me and the drugs are kind of tied together. You keep coming back, so obviously you like me messing with you. Why are moths attracted to the flame? Because it feels so fuckin’ great before you burn out - that’s my theory at least.”

You attempt to stand but Mitch grabs your wrist and pulls you back down.

Mitch snaps his fingers in front of your face and you flinch. “I almost forgot.” He pulls a box from below an end table, opens it, and offers you a pair of bright red stiletto heels.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stileto.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You raise an eyebrow. “Nice shoes, Mitch. [[Into cross dressing?]]” you tease.

You cross your arms over your breasts. “I already paid you. I didn’t come here to play dress up for you!”

“What? I just gave you a free bump. Put on the damned shoes.”

You look down at the uncomfortable looking footwear and frown. “I don’t want to take anything like that from you.”

“The correct phrase is: “Thank you,”” Mitch corrects you. “There are stockings in there too.”

You fall silent as you look into Mitch’s cold eyes. “Oh for fuck’s sake.” You slide the tight fitting stocking up your legs and smooth them out. Next you slide the oddly tight fitting footwear over your toes and onto your feet.

As soon as you stand up you nearly topple over. The long heel adds a couple inches to your height and alters your gait and balance. [[You manage to pull off a few wobbly steps while Mitch watches you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2176" name="You manage to pull off a few wobbly steps while Mitch watches you." tags="" position="15545,26390" size="100,100">You do a few laps around the living room. “Whoaa… There. Happy?” you ask Mitch.

“No,” he responds curtly. By his added scowl, it is clear Mitch is far from content with your show.

“I want way more than a bump.”

Mitch fails to hide his smirk behind his hand as he tosses you a small baggie.

“I want to see more. Keep going!” he urges you. 

Mitch whoops with delight as you bend over a nearby sofa.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stileto2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You kink your leg and give Mitch a steamy look. //Damn, I feel like a dress up doll...//

“Hmm… the shoes make your legs look even sexier.”

[[“How do I get myself into this shit?”]] you wonder aloud.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2177" name="“How do I get myself into this shit?”" tags="" position="15397,26496" size="100,100">Mitch doesn’t seem to hear you. “Get up and shake your ass!” he barks.

You feel foolish but shake your backside for Mitch’s entertainment.

//Fap-fap-fap-fap-fap-fap!//

You look back with distaste and see Mitch with penis in hand. 

“I want to see your pussy.”

“Stay over there and I will show you. Then I am out of here, okay?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/stileto3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Show me!”

You sit back on the couch and then pull down your underwear under Mitch’s burning gaze.

He strokes himself for the longest five minutes of your life.

“Why the fuck am I using my hand? Get over here and suck this, Taylor!”

“Ugh… I’m not your toy!” You stand and pull up your panties.

“Where are you going?!” Mitch shouts as you head to the door. “Wait!”

Hearing Mitch rush up behind you, you turn around and are surprised to [[see Mitch holding a large coil of rope.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2178" name="see Mitch holding a large coil of rope." tags="" position="15541,26538" size="100,100">Alarm bells go off in your mind. “What the fuck is that for?”

Mitch shrugs. “I am going to tie you up and fuck you.  It will be super hot,” he explains as if his plan is the most normal thing in the world.

Mitch has apparently ascended to a new level of insane perversion. “I am not agreeing to this!”

“Well good thing I am not looking for your approval. Don’t worry, it will be fun.  I am going to make you cum //so fucking hard you won’t be able to walk afterwards//,” he whispers to you.  “Now turn around and bend over. Give me your arms.”

Mitch notices your hesitation and becomes bewildered.  “Do we have to go through the earlier lessons again, Taylor?” he asks you with a stern yet mocking tone.  “Now either get on your fucking knees or your back,” Mitch orders you with an evil glint in his eye and rope in hand.  “Now choose.”

“Uhhnnn…”

[[Submit.]]
[[This has gone on long enough!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2179" name="Submit." tags="" position="15744,26745" size="100,100">You let out a deep sigh.  You estimate Mitch is probably at least four times as strong you are so you decide that there is no point in fighting. 

By submitting you can anticipate the likely outcome. You are screwed.  Literally… 

You shy away from Mitch’s gaze as you lie down on the couch, trying desperately to displace yourself as Mitch begins to bind your hands tightly with rope.

“Ouch!” you yelp.

Mitch gives you a slap on your ass for good measure. “If it is isn’t tight it won’t be authentic,” he explains.

“Hnnn…”

By the time he is finished tying you up, you can barely manage any movement beyond the barest wiggle.

“Taylor, you’ve done well. You’ve come a long way from a stubborn tomboy who could barely suck a cock.  But your attitude needs improving. You’re still way too uppity. Sure, you do what I say for the most part, but I can tell you still haven’t taken your new role to heart no matter how much I threaten you. So I think I am going to keep you here until you are properly trained.”

He slides a ring gag into your mouth with a chuckle.  “Wouldn’t want you biting anyone.”

“Rye wrron’t! Hease!” you plead through the gag.

“I wasn’t talking about me,” Mitch replies. Your captor&#39;s words foreshadowing awful events to come, [[you fear your nightmare is only just beginning.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2180" name="This has gone on long enough!" tags="" position="15344,26744" size="100,100">Something snaps in your mind.  You feel your accumulated rage shatter out of its metaphorical bottle and then flood into every fiber of your being. It is impossible to think of anything except your frustrating situation and how much it and the man responsible for it all enrages you.  Memories of all the indignities suffered, all the blackmail and awful demeaning shit you were forced to do with Mitch flashes through your mind like a disconnected slideshow.  It seems that every slight had finally accumulated into a huge stockpile of fuel for a massive furnace of anger.  //Try to control and dominate me?  Fuck you!//

“I have fucking had enough!  I don’t care what happens anymore!  Fuck you, asshole! How about //you// get on //your// knees?” you counter, in an anger-laden sultry yet deadpan manner.

“Huh?” Mitch is taken aback by your sudden transformation.  You pounce upon his confusion and snatch the rope from his hands. With a few graceful loops, you step forward and grab his hands, firmly pulling them behind his back and looping the rope tightly around his wrists.  //Hehe! I bet he didn’t expect that I spent years in Scouts! //

“You tied me up,” Mitch says in disbelief.  He then grimaces when he [[tries unsuccessfully to slip out of your expert knots.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2181" name="tries unsuccessfully to slip out of your expert knots." tags="" position="15196,26802" size="100,100">“No shit.  You wanted to do the same to me.  Just what were you planning on doing to me once I was //restrained and vulnerable?//”

Mitch swallows nervously in reply. His usual confidence seems blunted.

“Oh I remember!” you chirp happily.  “I believe you said you were going to //fuck// me.”

“Uh… I didn’t mean it quite like that,” Mitch lamely responds. “Or like you’re thinking I meant… er… I just wanted to make us both feel good is all.”

“Pfft!”

You sniff derisively. [[“Now what the hell am I going to do with you?”]] you wonder aloud.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2182" name="“Now what the hell am I going to do with you?”" tags="" position="15348,26896" size="100,100">You look back at Mitch and find that he is still brazenly ogling your chest despite the apparent danger. Even physically restrained, he is unable to control his monstrous libido.

With the gap in physical strength eliminated, you give Mitch an earful. “You’re a demented, sick guy, you know that!?” you shout only to have your eyes drawn to the obvious huge erection Mitch has straining in his pants.

“Are you fucking kidding me? I tied you up and you still can only think of one thing! You’re a pervert to your core!” you castigate Mitch.  “You are //sick!// You&#39;re a foul beast!&quot;

Mitch begins to sway slightly. His breathing becomes labored. “Yeah, okay…” he agrees. “I’m sick. Help me.” His words please you but the oily smile they are delivered with does not convince you.

Your anger boils over. “You… you…. //disgusting, pitiful, fucking bastard!//  How can you get this hard for me?  What the hell is wrong with you!?”

You push the heel of your stiletto into his balls and Mitch tenses up.  You have a sudden desire to reflect a tiny bit of the pain Mitch has inflicted upon you. [[You continue applying pressure until Mitch releases a cry of pain.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2183" name="You continue applying pressure until Mitch releases a cry of pain." tags="" position="15192,26942" size="100,100">Mitch begins to rise. “Sit down, you fuckin’ pig!” you command, your voice velvet coated steel.

Mitch stares at your unflinching expression for a moment before he gives in.  He lowers himself down and you start to tie him to the chair’s back.

Mitch tries to pull away at the last instant but he is unable to slip out of your bindings. “What are you--?”

//SLAP!//  You strike Mitch again, so hard his head turns and the sound rings throughout the room.

“I didn’t give you permission to speak!” you snap.

A flash of anger appears and vanishes across Mitch’s face like an errant lightning bolt. “C’mon, Taylor, knock it off th--”

//SLAP! Slap! Slap!// 

Mitch struggles to get a word in. “Ahh… Ow… Listen to me! I don’t need--”

//SLAP!// 

“If you--”

//SLAP!// 

After a dozen strikes, Mitch finally falls silent and you give him an evil smile, hoping he finds the circumstances to be somewhat familiar.  [[“It isn’t so fun being on the receiving end is it?”]] you ask him. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2184" name="“It isn’t so fun being on the receiving end is it?”" tags="" position="15344,27048" size="100,100">//Payback is a bitch!// you think. //Except he is kind of enjoying this a little too much… But then again… so am I. Wait...//

Of course you are enjoying your act of revenge but it suddenly occurs to you that you are breathing just as heavily as Mitch and it isn’t entirely due to your additional exertion. You take a step to the side where Mitch’s view is obstructed and gently slide a finger down your mons. Your panties are more than a bit warm and damp.

//What the fuck? Why am I getting turned on!? I am not a sado-masochist! Mitch treated me like a toy; I’m merely returning the favor! Damnit, Mitch, what have you done to me!?//

“You have to untie me sometime!” Mitch interrupts your thoughts. “Once I am free, I will put you in a cage and throw away the key,” Mitch threatens.

You shrug. “Well then you can just stay like that forever then,” you reply.

Mitch grits his teeth. “Someone will come eventually.”

“So?”

“Why are you doing this? I thought I pounded the spunk right out of you!”

You ignore him. “Isn’t it uncomfortable to be all bunched up?” you ask while pressing the toe of your red heel into Mitch’s groin.

Mitch finally composes himself. “Ahh... It sure is. You should take off my pants and blow me like the slut you are,” he orders you in a [[tone that brooks no disagreement.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2185" name="tone that brooks no disagreement." tags="" position="15196,27090" size="100,100">A tingle of warmth spreads through your body. You realize there is a thrill in both taking and giving orders. A mischievous spirit suddenly dominates you. Instead of obeying directly, you decide to increase Mitch’s frustration level so you strip down with a few graceful wiggles and then jam your sodden panties into Mitch’s mouth as a makeshift gag.

“Mrraahh!”

“There. Now shut the fuck up. How do my sweaty panties taste? Oh what’s that? You can’t even answer? Hahaha!”

“Urghh…”

“I hope you fucking choke on them.”

“Mmmmaaagggggggaaahbarr!” Mitch wails as you yank this underwear down.

“Gahhhh!”

The sound is so pleasing to your ears you cannot help but smile. //I want to hear Mitch scream even more!// 

“That’s right, Mitch. You’re //my// toy now! You’re just a dumb piece of meat,” you whisper into Mitch’s ear. [[“Now it is time for your //punishment!//”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2186" name="“Now it is time for your //punishment!//”" tags="" position="15344,27200" size="100,100">“Graaaaaaaaaaahhhh!” Mitch howls as you repeatedly pummel his groin, hitting him as hard as you can. With each slap and punch at his family jewels, Mitch’s cock remains stubbornly rigid.

//Whap-fap-fap-whap...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cockpunish.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Grrrahaaahh!” you snarl as you treat Mitch’s junk like a punching bag. “I am trying to //punish// you and here you are //enjoying //this!  Fuck you!  You’re not the one in control here anymore!” you shriek, slapping Mitch as hard as you can across the face.

The slap reverberates throughout the room. Your stinging hand print gracing his face, you look deep into Mitch’s lust clouded eyes.

As soon as they begin to focus, you punch Mitch right square in the middle of his junk.

“UGH!! Gaah…. Ugh…”  Mitch grunts.

Wishing you were stronger, you slap Mitch’s privates until he yelps in pain. Strangely, you notice his erection doesn’t waver, if anything it only gets larger.

“You are one fucked up person,” you admonish him as you grab his balls and squeeze as hard as you can.  You are immediately disappointed at your lack of grip strength, because Mitch only gives a moan that sounds more pleasurable than painful. Your other hand meanders upwards to Mitch’s cock, giving it a few lazy pumps up and down the shaft.  “C’mon you pathetic excuse for a man!  [[You can’t even resist the charms of another guy, you fucking perv!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2187" name="You can’t even resist the charms of another guy, you fucking perv!" tags="" position="15200,27242" size="100,100">Mitch has a wild look of panic-tinged arousal in his eyes that makes you hasten your movements. You feel absolutely powerful, holding Mitch’s very lifeblood in the palm of your hand. 

“C’mon, do it!  Do it! Cum, you naughty, bad cock!” You shout as you rapidly pump Mitch’s oozing manhood. Mitch begins to flail around, dislodging your panty gag.

“Uhhhh! Holy fuck, Taylor! I am going to-”

“Actually, //nope!//  I have changed my mind!” you shout over him.

Pleasure is yours to give or to withhold.

“Whaa? Gaahhh….”

Just when he is about to erupt, you grip Mitch’s penis as hard as you can and press your thumb down hard on the head of his glans like hitting a button on a joystick.  Mitch begins to twist and shake in frustration, his legs spasm but no orgasm occurs, blocked by your last minute actions.  

Your rival gives you an expression somewhere that lands between bliss and horror, with obvious frustration at your denial of the conclusion of his pleasure. He looks delightfully uncomfortable.

Mitch gives you a pleading look but you move your fingers away slightly and let him slowly soften in your hand.  Once he is flaccid, you give him a few tentative strokes and he is rock hard again within ten seconds.

You laugh at the young man as you tease him and casually slap a handful of precum onto his face.  

“Not so nice is it?” you tease him. [[“Maybe this will teach you not to be such a damned prick!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2188" name="“Maybe this will teach you not to be such a damned prick!”" tags="" position="15351,27346" size="100,100">//Er… speaking of pricks...//

You sigh as you look down at Mitch’s massive penis.  It’s so hard and warm, throbbing slightly in your hand.  It was undeniably //you// who was in control.  You almost feel sorry for Mitch.  With that stupid male brain he will forever be a slave ruled by an undiscriminating snake of lust. 

For the first time since your transformative ordeal began, you are glad you don’t have one.

//Was I always so pathetic?// You cannot help but wonder.  You look at Mitch, grunting and squirming pathetically while straining for release. He reminds you of a fish struggling to breathe outside of the water. A thought pops into your head.  //Men are no better than disgusting pigs!// you realize. 

“How does this feel?” you ask Mitch in a sultry voice as you run a single, slender finger up his manhood. Even barely touching the bully, his lust is palpable. Although you largely dislike doing anything sexual with Mitch, there is something profoundly amusing about teasing him. “Hmm?”

You withdraw your hand while Mitch looks up at you with immense disappointment. His expression quickly changes as you mount him and grind your slick pussy against Mitch’s shaft but stop before reaching his glans.

“Uhh… Yes…! No!” [[Mitch moans in near agony as you back off before insertion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2189" name="Mitch moans in near agony as you back off before insertion." tags="" position="15191,27396" size="100,100">Mitch’s cock strains against the warmth of your pussy, eager to penetrate it but unable to do so because of the awkwardness of the angle and his bindings. You dry, or rather //wet// hump for a bit until Mitch nearly slips inside of you by accident.

“Uh oh.  That is not going to happen!” you declare while backing off. “//I// get to decide who receives pleasure, not you, Mitch.  You’re the one tied to the fucking chair.”

Mitch’s frustration makes him extra snappy. “That’s bullshit and you know it. You’re a dumbass whore that always creams her brains out while we fuck.” 

You stare at each other for about thirty seconds, neither of you willing to look away.

Mitch’s arrogance and defiance enrages you. The desire for revenge seizes hold of you.  You don’t know if you will ever get a chance like this again.

You need a torture implement if you are going to get any satisfaction out of your pursuit of justice.

You leave Mitch in his chair and wander to the kitchen.  You open the cutlery drawer and look down at the contents with maniacal laughter ringing through your mind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drawer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2190" name="Take the steak knife" tags="" position="15344,27546" size="100,100">You decide to take the knife.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchknife.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The slender blade feels good in your hand. Combined with your rage and and the lingering effects of the cocaine you recently ingested, it makes you feel powerful.

You return to the living room. “Hey, Mitch. I brought you a gift this time,” you say as you reveal the knife.

Mitch’s eyes bulge as you brandish the knife at him in a threatening manner. His defiance quickly melts away as the blade presses against his throat. “Mgggaaah!”

“Hah, this is too much! You brutes are all cowards once the people you prey on choose to fight back.”

Mitch scowls. “You spineless cunt! You’re not going to touch me!” Mitch predicts.

Calling his bluff, you slash Mitch across his chest to show you’re serious. You then jab the knife half an inch deep into the pectoral muscle right above the nipple.

“Ahh! What the fuck!? You //stabbed// me!” Mitch speaks while staring down at his bleeding chest. [[“I can’t believe this…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2191" name="Take the fork" tags="" position="15046,27454" size="100,100">You decide to take the fork.  It looks like it would really fucking hurt, while not doing any serious lasting damage.  You don’t want to kill Mitch or anything, just make him pay for everything he has done to you.

Mitch looks confused when you return with a fork held in hand. By your menacing manner Mitch quickly interpretes your intent. “Whoa, wait a second!”

“Shut up!” you shriek.

“Come on I--”

//SLAP!// 

“What did I just say?  This little piggy is a slow learner! I think that’s probably because you’re a fucking moron, Mitch. I can’t believe I thought you had power over me. It’s not true though. //I have the fucking power here!//”

You rip off Mitch’s shirt and press the fork as hard as you can into his pectoral muscle. It digs into the flesh but doesn’t quite pierce, leaving a deep red, [[weeping trail as you rake it over his chest.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2192" name="weeping trail as you rake it over his chest." tags="" position="15006,27652" size="100,100">“Aggggggggggghhhh! Stop it, Taylor! You crazy bitch! Stop right n-oow-AHHHhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh!”

That was the moment you first saw genuine fear in Mitch’s eyes.  You instantly fall in love with that look and your desire to hear Mitch scream even more soon dwarfs all common sense.

“You’re being a bit too loud though,” you chide Mitch as you pick up your balled panties off the floor and ram them back into Mitch’s mouth. “Hehe. I want to enjoy this. I don’t want you causing any interruptions. Now let’s see how high your threshold for pain really is!”

“MPHHHAAGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!”

“Yes! Yes! More!”

You scratch Mitch until he manages to spit out the panty gag.

“You’re... insane!” Mitch howls.

“No, you’re the psycho, not me! You fucking blackmailing, drug using… manipulative, perverted piece of garbage.”

You stab Mitch in the chest with the fork and he yelps in pain… Unable to stop, you continue to push the fork in more aggressively until the young bully is covered in the prong marks and a lot of trickling blood.  After twenty minutes of delightful torture, Mitch now looks like he was badly mauled by a pack of very small tigers wielding tridents.

“Everything! And it’s your fault!” Your anger refuses to be doused by such a small amount of blood. “You raped me, so fair is fair, right? You stuck your gross dick inside me how many times? Compared to that, this knife is clean. So suck it up, pussy.”

“Ouuuch! Fuck!” Mitch wails as you add a few random cuts across his body. You end with a final slash on Mitch’s cheek.

You note the impact of the last cut as Mitch slumps over. “Please, not my face…”

[[“Ohhh that felt so good!”]] you purr.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2195" name="“Ohhh that felt so good!”" tags="" position="15352,27702" size="100,100">You keep slicing until your actions make it impossible for Mitch to hide his own rage.

“You psychotic bitch!&quot; Mitch erupts. &quot;I should have just killed your tranny ass when I had the chance,” Earns Mitch another deep cut. His furious expression gets him a slap and another laceration down his abdomen. Mitch suddenly goes absolutely berserk, shaking violently. You barely manage to prevent him from breaking the chair but topple to the ground along with him in the process. 

Your head lands right next to Mitch’s, face to face. With bloodshot eyes, he snarls at you like a beast before beginning to rant and rave with spittle splattering across your cheek. “UnnggAHHH!! TAAAAAAYLOR! FUCK! LET ME GO! YOU’RE FUCKING DEAD! //DEAD!//”

//Schlick!//
 
You had lost track of the knife in your tumble. It is now embedded up to the handle in Mitch’s stomach, held by your trembling hand. 

Confusion reigns for ten seconds before Mitch’s fury intensifies. He lunges forward to the limits of his bindings. He hisses at you, his lips peeled back in a mask of rage so fearsome that you stab him again on impulse, relishing the vanishing of his anger and the look of utter disbelief on Mitch’s face as the patch of redness grows. The whole situation doesn’t seem real. Every second passes with what seems like ten times its normal duration.

But you don’t feel right letting Mitch off so easily.

You didn’t mean to kill Mitch in the first place but each blow is cathartic. As you sink the blade repeatedly into his flesh, you become utterly consumed with the satisfaction of your anger until you’re [[red from head to toe and your frenzy subsides.]]

“Hnnnnngggaahhh….”

“Uhh! Uh! Oh shut up. You love it, you big fuckin’ slut!” Mitch laughs as he rapes you.

He fills you with spunk and then drops you like a soiled tissue.

You are left twitching on the couch with the aftermath of your sex dripping from your pussy.

After a few minutes of sullen silence, Mitch picks up his phone and walks slightly out of view.

You hear him walk to the kitchen and then listen as Mitch helps himself to a drink. His actions only serve to remind you of your own sudden onset of thirst. 

Mitch turns on the TV and ignores you, treating you with as much attention as a piece of furniture.

About half an hour later, there is an almost cheerful sounding knock at the door.  The sound nearly scares the shit out of you and your despair only deepens as you [[watch the entirety of Mitch’s gang file into the room.]]

“She sucks a mean dick,” Gil jokes.

“Hooooly shit! You weren’t bluffin’ man! She is a fox!” opines the bald man.

“Yeah,” Mitch says as if the compliment means nothing. “Taylor has been my personal bitch for months now, so I figured it was time to share with my bros.  Can’t keep all the good shit to myself, right?” he laughs.

“So...can I?” asks the short one. The man’s eyes linger on your body like a like someone discovering an oasis in the midst of the desert.

“Help yourself! I already gave her a good go. Taylor, you’re cool with it, eh?”

“Raaah!”

“I am pretty sure that means yes.”

You’re definitely going to be raped by Mitch’s entire gang unless you do something quick.

“I want a BJ too!”

“Relax guys,” Mitch cuts in. There is enough of Taylor to go around. Don’t worry.”

“He’s right,” Stephan agrees. [[“We have all the time in the world,”]] he says as he unzips his fly.

“Holy shit man! You need a better gag than that!” remarks Gil.

A calloused hand covers your mouth followed by a thicker strip of cloth that makes it impossible to emit a sound. You are then dragged onto the floor and violated by Mitch&#39;s crew.

The men grab at you. Even though you try to kick them away, your bindings make fighting back impossible. The ropes around your knees are pulled down. Two of the goons grab your ankles, spreading your legs for the entire gang.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ganguse.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Eyes wide with horror, you watch as the men fumble with their pants, descending on you with erections held in hand.

Your defenseless pussy is inevitably filled with cock. You are brutally raped for the next half hour.

You endure in a silent state of agony [[until a loud knock sounds at the door.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2201" name="Let’s have some fun!" tags="" position="6734,8609" size="100,100">You swallow nervously. //Does she mean what I think she does…?// “Julie this doesn’t make any sense!”

Your sister shrugs. “Not everything in life has to make sense,” she chides you. “We have to follow our hearts, or at least I do. The purpose of life is obviously to pursue love and fun. So, how about a little game?” Julie suggests, her eyes twinkling like dark diamonds.

Your eyes narrow suspiciously. “What kind of game?”

“Pool. We carried that heavy ass table inside when we moved in and it has barely gotten any use outside of a few party nights.”

The prospect of some rest and relaxation is a bit appealing. Eager to be introduced into a potentially less awkward environment, you follow Julie into the room with the pool table.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pooltable.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hmmm… I have a bad feeling about this.”

//Julie is way better at this than I am… I am not bad with angles and stuff but Julie is pretty gifted. I guess she makes up for her lack of math ability with her stick handling skills....//

“Don’t worry. I’ll go easy on ya!” Julie assures you, as if reading your thoughts.

//Alright, I am going to...//
[[Play cautiously.]] 
[[Play aggressively]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2202" name="Play cautiously." tags="" position="6590,8704" size="100,100">//Thwack-thwack...// The game proceeds exactly as expected. Julie completely dominates you like a pool shark.

“Wow, you’re really a master at anything involving sticks or balls,” you tease Julie in an effort to reduce her concentration.

“I am good at putting things in holes too,” Julie replies. “Eight ball, corner pocket,” Julie calls her final shot.

“Fuck.”

//Clack-ker-plunk.//

“Hehe! I win!” cheers a jubilant Julie. “Now for my victory prize!” she says while staring directly at you.

“Wait! We didn’t agree on-mmwaahh!” //I thought I was coming in here to avoid sexual harassment!//

In a rush of citrus perfume, Julie rushes you and locks her lips with yours. Before you know what is happening, Julie is pulling the slick panties right off of you.

“Julie I am your br… er… //we are siblings!//” you rephrase
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“So what? You’re my cute little sister now!”

“That doesn’t make this any less weird…”

“Oh come on! Sexy siblings are way better than kissing cousins,” Julie insists. She then grabs your ass cheek and pulls you close. [[Your sister’s lips reunite with your own.]]

“Shut up.” Your sister silences you with a barrage of kisses. “Mwaah!”

The sudden onset of intimacy and passion leaves you dizzy. “Huahh…” You sigh. Flustered and crimson-faced, you turn away from Julie in an effort to get some fresh air.

“Taylor, if you don’t like this then how come you’re so warm down here?” Julie asks you.

“Hmm? Oh!”

Julie’s fingers brush against your labia. Your sister giggles as she slides down the middle of your pussy and withdraws a glistening finger. [[Julie inspects her handiwork with a satisfied smirk.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2205" name="Julie inspects her handiwork with a satisfied smirk." tags="" position="6589,8864" size="100,100">“Maybe you need something a bit //firmer//?” Julie suggests.

You are unsure what she means until Julie grabs a pool cue and brandishes it at you like a spear.

“No, that’s alright!” you cry.

Julie ignores you and presses the cue against your clit. Your body tenses up, anticipating something more.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Eeeahh! Julie! Stop it!” you cry as Julie presses her hot tongue into the center of your vagina.

//Oh fuck! It’s happening again!// Both of you have lost your sense of reason.

You want to stop but cannot. You know that going down this path with Julie will lead to irreversible consequences.

//But maybe they are worth it...// you think while biting your lip and staring into Julie’s big, brown eyes. [[Her pupils appear so large that they threaten to swallow you whole.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2206" name="Her pupils appear so large that they threaten to swallow you whole." tags="" position="6733,8904" size="100,100">Julie licks the handle and then jams the cue inside you.

“Hnnngghh…. Uh… Uh… Ah… ”  You try to hold the cue back but it slowly slips through your hands (and deeper into your body).

“It’s not quite as good as a real dick,” Julie reflects. 

“A //dick!?// Ahh…” Your mind feels like it has been twisted into a knot.

[[You stare in shock at the object impaling your lower body and wonder how the fuck you got to this point in your life.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2207" name="You stare in shock at the object impaling your lower body and wonder how the fuck you got to this point in your life." tags="" position="6591,9011" size="100,100">Julie’s tongue joins the erotic assault on your burning nethers.

It becomes impossible to stay silent. “Haaayyyeeeaaaah! Mmmm….” you moan.  //Oh shit, here we go again...//

As the stiff wooden cue pierces your flesh, Julie lowers her tongue, licking your clit and lapping up any errant drips of love nectar.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Julie’s tonguework, an erotic internal and external massage, drives you beyond the point of madness. You can’t fight Julie when she truly desires something. Too bad that something is now a someone. //You.//

//Fuck...// You close your eyes and drift off, content to revel in the pleasurable sensations unfolding below. Your hips begin a soft bucking motion. Your thighs slowly press together and gently touch Julie’s hair. The pressure inside you builds until your toes curl and you cum hard, shuddering on top of Julie’s lips. Your body seems to have a mind of its own, and you gently hump your sister’s face in an effort to chase down any latent pleasure.

//What kind of brother and sister are we?// you wonder.

Julie refuses to let you go, slowly sucking your clit while you come down. In this moment, you’re so sensitive that you want to push Julie back but you can’t //quite// muster up the courage to do so.

After what feels like ages, Julie pulls back while licking her lips seductively.

“It is polite to return a favor,” she says, her hot breath tickling your labia.

You take the hint. Your arousal has already blunted your common sense. “Huahh… Okay…” you agree.

Julie seems to enjoy commanding you, [[so you ask her if she has any requests.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2208" name="so you ask her if she has any requests." tags="" position="6735,9061" size="100,100">“Kiss my chest,” she curtly orders.

You take turns playfully pulling off the remainder of each other’s clothing.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Once your flesh is exposed, Julie scoots forward and passionately kisses you. To make matters even weirder, you can taste //yourself// on Julie’s lips.

By following Julie’s demanding eyes, you sit down on the edge of the pool table.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool8.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Julie begins to dance. She looks so happy it is almost frightening in a way. You’ve lived with Julie for ages and never seen her like this.

//She looks fucking crazy but it’s not her usual kind of crazy… Ah, it isn’t hurting anyone if I let her be happy for a bit...//

You watch Julie wiggle hypnotically for a few moments [[before attempting your own imitation.]]

“Oooooooo!” Julie coos. “Very nice! Very-very nice!” Julie says as she runs a finger from your vagina to your anus. “Ooooh! It’s wet back here too.”

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool11.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The world fades away until there is nothing except the quiet mustering passion of your kiss.

“We’re both alike. Let’s just go with it and have lots of fun,” Julie whispers sweet rationalizations in your ear.

[[“Isn’t this weird for you?”]] you wonder. “It is for me.”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2212" name="“Isn’t this weird for you?”" tags="" position="6732,9369" size="100,100">Julie taps her lip thoughtfully before answering. “Not really. I wish you were born like this.”

“I don’t.”

“But we would have had so much fun!”

“We don’t need to both be girls to have fun...err...”

“No! Don’t give me that shit! You only get to have sex with me as a girl.”

“What!? That isn’t what I meant!”

“You’re a girl now and you should stay that way. If you were ugly, I’d say change back- if you even can. But you’re hot. I guarantee [[you will have way more fun if you start a new life with me as your guide!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2213" name="you will have way more fun if you start a new life with me as your guide!" tags="" position="6592,9459" size="100,100">“Don’t just decide my whole life path for me! Ahh…”

Julie interrupts your argument by smothering you with kisses.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool12.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You realize that if you mute the nagging voices in your mind, there is only a beautiful, sexy, and willing young woman in front of you.

You smile at Julie. //She is really pretty...//

Julie approves of your change in perspective. “That’s better! Hmm! Wait!” Suddenly Julie’s eyes flash. “I will be right back!” she shouts back at you as she dashes upstairs.

Julie returns a minute later… armed with a large plastic penis between her legs.

“What the fuck?! Is that a //strap-on//!?” 

Julie grins. “Good eye!” she replies jokingly, shaking her new member at you.

[[“Why are you wearing that... thing?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2214" name="“Why are you wearing that... thing?”" tags="" position="6736,9509" size="100,100">Julie rolls her eyes while flapping her long lashes at you. The contrast of Julie’s breasts, cute face, and new cock form a disturbing portrait. “Because I’m going to fuck you, Taylor,” she answers happily. “I want you to have the full female experience… while also keeping you all for myself.”

A very large plastic penis lines up with the tiny opening of pussy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool13.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Whoa! Whoa! That thing is huge!”

You nearly go cross eyed as you imagine being penetrated by such a big object. 

“Is this alright, Taylor?”

“It’s okay, Taylor. This is probably a little too much for you now. Let’s just stick to kissing until you feel more comfortable.”

//Even kissing makes me feel weird...//

You still end up in Julie’s bed anyway.

It is hard to form coherent thoughts but a persistent nagging feeling of guilt forces you to try and voice your concerns. “Julie, I… I love you…” you begin.

Julie’s face brightens and you feel regret and sadness, knowing that no matter what you do, there will be a lot of discomfort in your future. You don’t want to hurt or disappoint Julie. Nor do you want to become a social pariah. //This has to be our little secret.... er BIG secret! Oh man, what am I even thinking?!//

//Maybe a little pleasure and Julie’s happiness can help balance everything out!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/poolp.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With one swift stroke, she fills you up. Your virginity is claimed by your sister via a plastic penis.

“Hnngg!!”

“Still not as good as a real dick, but it feels good, right?” Julie presses you.

“Ahh…”

Julie reaches around and massages your vagina, helping the plastic phallus sink even deeper inside you.

//Julie’s… //dick// is inside me… Ahh! FUCK! This is so messed up!// You’re a man. Julie is a woman. Everything is as mixed up as your genitals are about to be.

[[“I am going to start moving now,”]] Julie warns you.

Your sister vigorously fucks you with her strap on, using her hips and fake cock like a man. The huge penis repeatedly disappears inside your feminine folds. You are amazed something so large is able to fit inside you.

Compared to the cue, the dildo is much larger and ribbed. You feel the entirety of its unfamiliar shape molding your vaginal canal to its exact size.

It hurts and feels more uncomfortable than pleasurable but you let Julie have her way with you.

The dildo is withdrawn with a wet //plop// and [[Julie fills the void with her tongue.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool14.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Julie’s tongue suddenly migrates upward and plows into your asshole.

Shocks reverberate through your entire body. “Yeaaaoooahh!!” you cry. “Why would you do that, Julie?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool15.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I just wanted to see the look on your face,” she answers with a smile.

“Well I don’t want to see yours anymore!” you shoot back. In an effort to turn the tables before it is too late, you pounce on Julie and drag her down to the floor.

You sit on Julie’s face. [[She doesn’t seem to mind.]]

“Ohh fuck! Why do you keep doing this to me, Julie?! I am going to cuuuuuuum~! Ahhhhh….”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pool16.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your illusion of control vanishes as Julie takes advantage of your slackened limbs to flip you over. “I am not done with you yet!” she purrs.

“Huah.... Julie…”

You somehow end up in Julie’s bed, your legs splayed to the side.

It is hard to form coherent thoughts but a persistent nagging feeling of guilt forces you to try and voice your concerns. “Julie, I… I love you…” you begin.

Julie’s face brightens and you feel regret and sadness, knowing that no matter what you do, there will be a lot of discomfort in your future. You don’t want to hurt or disappoint Julie.

“I love you too, Taylor!”

Giving your body to someone you love is surprisingly easy. You just never expected that love to be within your own family.

You stare into Julie’s eyes and see nothing scary except an over abundance of desire.

Julie senses your unease. “We can talk later… Now let’s just be us.”

You nod, content to continue your night of forbidden love.

With thousands of kisses and heavy petting, your passionate night intensifies to its climax. Once Julie cums, she pursues the next orgasm with a determination that frightens you. Once momentarily satisfied, Julie directs her focus onto you.

With your sister’s face buried in your crotch, you cum hard again, clamping down and shuddering around Julie while flooding her face with love juice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sisterservice.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Julie laps up every drop.

Your tongues stay intertwined for hours. Julie is an excellent kisser; she is playful and passionate.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sistersmakeout.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The two “sisters” indulge each other far into the night and fall asleep in each other’s arms. You wake up in the mid morning, tangled together. Since you are already late for class, you snuggle back up to Julie and hope that your little dream world will continue to last just a little bit longer.

Next, they plow you mercilessly, alternating in an unceasing wave until you are puckered, broken, and sore, dripping with the cum of six different men.

You do your best to endure, focusing on survival for one minute at a time. The only distraction you can find is in embracing the pleasurable aspects of the experience. The men fondle and fuck you into a compliant and submissive state.

You can muster only a whimper as you watch Mitch withdraw a long syringe. Needles have always bothered you but now you are casually injected with drugs as if you were a piece of livestock.

“Take this too,” he says, handing you a small blue pill.

Just as you are about to conjur up a spine and tell him to fuck off, a numbing sensation sweeps through your body and renders you speechless.  You almost find it difficult to stand as the world gradually fades away until only a singular hedonistic desire remains. You feel giddy and smile as you fall into the most divine sense of tranquility infused equilibrium that you have ever experienced.

You take two massive loads all over your face. The men pelt you with semen for an almost comically long time. The double blowjob and facial leaves you breathless.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/doublefacial.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“You guys came so much…”

“Thanks, Taylor! That was //fuckin’ sweet//,”Gil compliments your efforts as he wipes his glans over your lips. 

As you struggle to breathe between thick strands of foul, bitter, stinky semen you can’t help but hold a different opinion.

“You don’t have to worry about swallowing all that or we’d be here all damn day.”

“Gee, thanks…”

[[“See ya later, slut,”]] Gil says as he departs.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2231" name="“See ya later, slut,”" tags="" position="15740,27693" size="100,100">It takes you ten minutes to wash your face. You would have been even more thorough but you are interrupted by a random student wanting to take a piss.

Burning with embarrassment, you flee the men’s room and head for Mitch’s table.

You find him counting a wad of cash.

Several dots connect in your mind, instantly pissing you off. “Did you take money for this!?”

Mitch seems unconcerned by your outburst. “Of course.”

The sudden realization that you are basically a prostitute hits you like a punch to the stomach.

//Wait, at least prostitutes get paid!// “You’re not even giving me anything?” //I shouldn’t even care about that but...//

“You get to keep me happy. You are racking up a huge tab by snorting everything in sight, so this is merely maintenance on your debt.”

“My debt!? I don’t have any fucking debt!” Your voice cracks. You feel as high strung as you sound. You feel stressed, like you’re anxiously bouncing from disaster from disaster. The urge to get high tickles the back of your mind.

Mitch reads you like a book. [[“The good shit is free as long as you do what I say.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2232" name="“The good shit is free as long as you do what I say.”" tags="" position="15592,27735" size="100,100">
The next day, you meet Mitch’s friends in one of the campus parks. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/gangraped.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As soon as you are hidden from prying eyes, the men become ravenous beasts.

They rip off your clothes and ram their hard dicks inside you.

You end up with grass and cum stains in odd places. Your muscles ache so you head to Mitch for some “pain relief.”

“Please, I need more…” you beg.

“More what?”

“Drugs. [[More drugs! Anything!]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2233" name="More drugs! Anything!" tags="" position="15744,27845" size="100,100">“And cock?”

“Err…”

“One comes with the other. On your knees, slut. You know the drill. Come here and show me what you have learned!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mitchlickballs.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You unleash every trick you’ve learned and give Mitch the blowjob he desires.

As you slurp down his cum, Mitch begins preparing a syringe. He sets it down before you and snatch it out of his hands. Heroin? Cocaine? You don’t care anymore. You tie your arm off, find a vein and stick yourself. As you push the plunger in, a cascade of icy-hot tingles surge through your body. You suddenly feel like a million bucks. [[Your propped up enthusiasm doesn’t waver even when Mitch’s gang arrives with their friends in tow.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2234" name="Your propped up enthusiasm doesn’t waver even when Mitch’s gang arrives with their friends in tow." tags="" position="15600,27875" size="100,100">You are surrounded by a ring of erect cocks.  They converge upon you and you do your best to stand your ground.

“You’re just a fuckin’ little cumslut!” Mitch yells at you.

“Yes! I am a cumslut!” you echo your agreement.  The admission feels unbelievably liberating.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/hedonistorgy.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A minute later, you have a penis thrusting inside each of your holes and one gripped in each hand.  Five men fuck you at the same time… and when they are finished five more take their place.  You fuck until you are raw and covered with the seed of at least thirty men, although it is impossible to keep track.  As you lie on the bed and look out over your heaving, cum spattered breasts you feel a familiar warm glow spread over you.  //So many orgasms.  So many dicks…  // You feel like you are a thousand miles beyond losing your mind.  You can feel semen leaking out of you, dripping from your used pussy and ass along with a thick coating covering most of your face and body.  You know you should feel ashamed but instead you feel fantastic. You end up fucking most nights and sleeping during the day.  You have sex for money and for fun.  Intercourse with strangers has become a habit, an automatic, almost instinctual coupling brought on by an inexorable biochemical craving.  A need to be //filled and used// dominates all your waking thoughts.  You have become a whore and you love it.  Your life revolves around dicks and drugs, their acquisition, and a constant pursuit of higher pleasure.  Sure you might die or overdose one day soon but everyone dies eventually and almost none of them will have had as much sex as you.  You almost envy the normies, for they will never be able to experience even a fraction of your bliss.

“Oh yeah, no problem. Say hi to Taylor for me, will ya?”

//You just did...// “Sure thing. No worries!”

You leave Evan behind and continue strolling through the campus park.

Since Julie’s body is similar to your female form, you don’t notice much of a difference. You nearly forget you are wearing a different face until you spot a familiar handsome man waiting in front of your house.

You freeze solid. //Oh shit! This was such a bad idea! What the hell am I going to do now!?//

As you are frantically pondering that question, &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Ryan&quot; &quot;Ryan desc&quot;&gt;&gt; rushes over to you and wraps his arms around you. [[Ryan grabs your hips and pulls you in tighter until your breasts are squished against his broad chest.]]

Except for your thundering heart, the world seems to slow down as Ryan lowers his face towards yours.

//No. No! NO! NO! MAYYYDAY!//

“Mwah… Mmm….” Your lips meet and your panic takes on a deeper sense of urgency. //Agggh I am kissing Ryan! Eagfhgahahahgh… blah!// You have long admired your sister’s boyfriend, especially his confidence and success. Now you know what his lips taste like.

“Hauh… hauh…” Breathless and confused, you withdraw from Ryan.

“Julie… I was just about to call you,” he whispers in your ear. 

Ryan seems to be implying a question. “I got off work early…”

“Heh. Got off early to get off early? You timed this perfectly. I have been so //pent up// this past couple days without you. You look pretty flushed yourself. I know it is hard being alone, but don’t worry, I’m here now! Let’s go inside, shall we?” Ryan gestures to the front door.

Ryan’s words reinforce the suspicion that if you go inside bad things will probably happen.

This is totally a conversation I don’t want to have!// You decide the path of least resistance is merely to roleplay for a bit and get Ryan to leave before Julie returns from work and stabs you in the face.

As you step over the threshold in your sister’s body, with Ryan a step behind, you realize you have moved yourself from an awkward situation into an //incredibly// awkward one.

You pause in the kitchen as Ryan looks at you with obvious desire. You try and deflect his attention with food.

“How about a snack?” you offer.

Ryan shakes his head. “All I want is you, Julie.” Ryan steps past you and fills two large glasses with tap water. “We are going to have one hell of a sexy workout. It pays to stay hydrated,” Ryan asserts.

“EH!?”  //Is he preparing for a fucking sex marathon!?//

“What’s up with you? You’re acting kinda weird. You know, Julie, if you’re stressed out I have the best cure //right here.//” Ryan gently repositions your hand over his erection. With two splayed fingers you can sense his desire conveyed through his throbbing, hard member.

There is something exciting about your deception. You feel like an improv actor, gaining strength from the audience.

You are in a dangerous position and yet some element of that is exciting.

[[Ryan grabs your hand and leads you upstairs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2240" name="Ryan grabs your hand and leads you upstairs." tags="" position="9953,35393" size="100,100">
Once the door closes you feel trapped. You look at Ryan and find yourself at a complete loss for words.

&quot;You seem eager to please tonight,&quot; Ryan observes. “That was nice of you to offer me a snack… even though your cooking is deadly.”

//Oh fuck, I am not really sure how Julie acts around Ryan in private...// Your sister can be sweeter than a slice of cherry pie one second and pure poison the next.

//I guess if she was a bitch the whole time she wouldn’t have a hot boyfriend like Ryan. Err… HOT BOYFRIEND?! HOLY FUCK, what the hell is wrong with me!?! I have spent way too long as a girl!//

Ryan looks at you with concern. “Are you alright, Julie? You look a bit out of it.”

“I am just… tired.”

“Well I know one way to help you get a good sleep,” Ryan remarks with a playful smile. The young man exudes casual power. [[You doubt you have the willpower to refuse him.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2241" name="Spend some quality time with Ryan" tags="" position="9853,35645" size="100,100">“Wait, Ryan! There is something I have to tell you!”

“Let’s wait until afterwards for pillow talk,” Ryan replies.

//Afterwards!?//

“Um… Wait, I…”

//I guess I need to bite the bullet… I have to act like Julie… And apparently Julie loves to suck dick… Fuck, I really hope she never finds out about this!// you think as you strip off the remainder of your clothes.

Channelling your inner pornstar, you open your mouth and Ryan thrusts forward.

“Ohhhh fuck! I love my life…” Ryan gasps as you wrap your lips around the head of his cock. “You’re the best girlfriend ever!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/juliesuckdick.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmm…” You swirl your tongue over Ryan’s weeping penis and taste his manly flavor.

//Ryan is so big...// “Myaahh…. Mmm….” You idly wonder how many times Julie has done this.

You fall into your role as Julie, the dutiful girlfriend. You do your best to pleasure Ryan, sinking to your knees. 

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/julieimp2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You suck dick like a champ until Ryan pushes you back onto the bed and climps on top of you.

Your head hits the pillow and Ryan rises above you while slowly stroking his cock.

You open your mouth as hot jizz dribbles down your lips.

“Fwaahh…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/julieimpbj.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

An orgasm meant for Julie now coats your face. Your whole body is warm. You’re undeniably mixed up.

Ryan kisses your forehead. He looks absolutely content. His mood seems to rub off on you. //Holy shit… This is what it feels like to be Julie?//

You think about Drew and Ryan. You feel like you have deceived and let both of them down. //And add me to that list too...I am an awful person!//

Ryan’s heavy breathing quickly subsides. “Just give me a few seconds and I will be good to go.”

//What!? This isn’t over yet?! But he already came so much...//

[[You are mesmerized as Ryan’s member returns to life.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2242" name="You doubt you have the willpower to refuse him." tags="" position="9799,35439" size="100,100">Ryan is a man who always gets what he wants. Now it is clear he wants //you.// //Or Julie… Shit...//

You cannot help but stare as Ryan’s manhood fills your vision.

//Holy fuck that is a big dick!// Ryan makes Drew look tiny by comparison.

“What’s wrong, Julie? Suddenly shy? Normally you would be all over this…”

“Uhhmm…”

“How about one of your famous blowjobs? Don’t leave me hanging!”

//Famous blowjobs…? Agggh! Way to overachieve, Julie!//

You look at Ryan and then his erection. Your pussy is wet, shuddering with a yearning to be filled.

//I am Julie right now…//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/julieryansex.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You’ve gone too far down this path to change course now. You mount Ryan, grab his penis, and then guide it into your vagina.

“Hnnnghaahh….”

“Julie, ugh! You’re so tight!”

Ryan fucks you like a stallion, giving you an experience you will never forget. You endure the sexual hurricane until you clamp down and cum on Ryan’s thundering penis. The new experience is enlightening.

“I am going to fill you up!” Ryan announces.

“No! Don’t! Uhhnnn…. Ah, cum on my face!” you improvise.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/julieryanfacial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Ryan obeys, withdrawing in time to erupt all over your face, giving Julie’s white freckled skin a fresh second coat of her boyfriend’s seed. Your little experiment has gone far out of bounds.

//Uh oh...//

&quot;That was awesome. Hmm...&quot; Ryan rolls over picks up his phone. “Did you just send me a text?” he asks you.

//Oh shit!//

“I am really sorry, Taylor…” Drew huffs.

“It’s fine! You were just trying to be assertive… and its a nice change. I know you didn’t actually expect me to do that!”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2245" name="Be polite with Drew" tags="" position="6294,12804" size="100,100">You suddenly feel a bit embarrassed. 

“Drew, thanks for looking out for me. You’re a great guy. I appreciate it but don&#39;t make a habit out of it.  I can take care of myself,” you boast while desperately hoping you sound more confident than you truly feel.

//Bah-bah-bah-bam!// A loud introduction of electric guitar heralds the start of one of your favorite songs.

“But you’re… Ah, okay, I understand,” Drew replies in monotone. You can tell he is disappointed.

“Don’t worry about me! I know you don’t like the loud shit so if I want to go stand next to the speakers you don’t have to follow me. Just relax and enjoy the Zombies! I will come find you in a--”

The bodies of much larger people surge around you, blocking you in.  Suddenly you feel a hand - a very strong, large hand cupping your asscheek.  You try and turn around and protest but the press of the bodies around you makes that impossible.  You are now essentially immobile, pinned against several men.

You breathe a sigh of relief when the hand withdraws but it returns a second later, as a butt-stinging slap.  The music blasting from the speakers is vibrating your internal organs so you hear nothing of the slap, just the lingering pain of a hand print.

A new song begins and the crowd and mosh pit becomes rowdier.  You manage to put a small bit of distance between you and the groper.  You start jumping with the crowd, moving to the energetic beat of the music.  Near the end of the song you jump up and an unknown man presses against you from behind.

“Not again…”

Two large hands cup your breasts and squeeze them //hard,//  “Owwwwww!” you howl, your voice barely audible even to your own ears.

As the tempo of the music accelerates, your assailant begins to dry hump you from behind.  You can feel something hard and thick poking into the crevice between your ass cheeks.

“Nooo….”  This is the last thing you want.  You suddenly feel like you are suffocating.  You are trapped.  //Am I going to get raped on the dance floor?//

There is nothing you can do except endure.  No one else around you seems to notice or care what you are doing, all attention is on the band and the stage.

The man behind you withdraws his hands and redeploys them around your waist.

You feel like crying as the man slowly slides your shorts and panties down.  //I can’t believe this is happening!  One of the best nights of my life is going to be ruined by some perverted asshole with no self control!//

You feel the man’s cock slowly slide forward between your thighs. You can do nothing but wiggle against the press of bodies, all men, stronger and taller than you, standing like immobile walls surrounding you.

“Help!” you shout as the groper’s cock presses against the opening of your vagina.

You pray to a god you don’t completely believe in to save you.  You want this awful moment to stop more than anything but time pushes on inexorably.

Even clawing at the nearby press of bodies does not provoke a reaction. Since you lack the room to move properly, your actions feel phenominely underpowered. No one pays you any attention over the blasting of the the power chords ringing out above.

Your stomach turns as one of your favorite songs is forever ruined.

The only thing you can think to do is to try and turn around. You manage to shift your position enough to avoid penetration, but the price you pay is high. 

After twisting and turning, you end up face to face with an ugly and very obese man.

Now that you can look him in the eye, you quickly evaluate him as someone you should not cross.

Your foot is numb and your extremities are cold while other parts next to your friends are warm and sweaty.

Drew is snoring louder than a chainsaw while Evan has his face pressed into a balled up sweater.

“Wow…” 

While desperately trying to repress memories of the preceding night, you crawl awkwardly over Drew.

As you emerge from the tent, your muscles protest. It’s plain that your new, softer body prefers the comforts of a real bed.

“Ow…”

You adjust your disheveled clothing under a haze of embarrassment as the events of the previous night flash through your mind.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck…” you curse while stretching out your sore limbs. You feel like you slept in a pretzel shape. //A sweaty pretzel entwined with two other sweaty pretzels… God damnit! Way to go, Taylor! Evan and Drew may lack self control but what’s my excuse?//

After a few minutes, your friends crawl out after you. They look like they had a rough sleep as well.

//I wonder if Evan remembers last night...//

Evan gives you the dopiest, most over-eager smile imaginable and you cringe. “[[At least we didn’t get eaten by a bear!]]” he cheerfully remarks.

“We will be fine as long as we stick together!” you assure your friends.

Unwilling to stand still at a critical moment, you spring into action, quickly taking down the tent before surveying your surroundings.

As you squint out at the uniform forest that stretches out in every direction, your anxiety increases. //How the fuck are we going to get out of here!?// The danger of your circumstances is very real and for the first time since setting out, you’re genuinely scared.

//At least I have Evan and Drew...//

//Guuuuuurgle.// Drew’s stomach growls loudly.

The sound makes you smile but the solemn reminder of your lack of supplies dampens your amusement. “How much food and water do we have?” you ask Drew.

Drew replies, ashen faced. “Not much… I came prepared but I thought this was going to be a quick hike…”

//Meaning he didn’t pack for all of us… I guess we should be happy Drew brought as much as he did.//

You gratefully split a granola bar three ways. Looking at the faces of your friends, [[you can tell that morale is low.]]

He points in a seemingly random direction. “Let’s go!” he shouts before barreling off into the trees.

“Uhh…”

“Wait!” Drew protests as Evan begins to thrash through a wall of bushes. “You’re going the wrong way!” he shouts.

Evan turns back to Drew and angrily brandishes his walking stick. “How the hell do you know? We’re lost, fatso! Running in any direction is better than staying put!”

“That’s not true! The rise sun rises in the //East//, you moron! If we go out that way we will go right out into the //middle of nowhere!// We are trying to find civilization, not get even more lost!”

“Oh…” Evan’s confidence vanishes while Drew looks exhausted before even setting out. You know escaping the forest will probably be a difficult endeavor. 

Your friends look at you expectantly.

“Don’t worry, guys! I will lead. Evan, you’re like a broken compass. I am pretty small, so I can probably slip through and pick a good route for us.”

Evan begins to protest but quickly stops himself. “Oh… so you’ll be walking //in front// of us? Okay then! It’s fine,” he insists. “Lead away.”

Within a few steps Evan whistles obnoxiously and you understand the reason for his quick turn around. You glance back at Evan, becoming a bit self conscious when you realize he is staring directly at your butt.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/jeanass.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Oh, for fuck’s sake… Ah, whatever! I- we - have bigger problems than Evan being a pervert...//

The hike continues with your shapely ass in the lead. You move slowly through the forest until you feel the afternoon heat begin to take hold.

“Huuahh… Huahh…” Drew’s heavy breathing nearly drowns out the sound of nature.

You look back. “Are you guys alright?”

“Uh… Yeah…” A red faced Evan and Drew exchange glances.

For some strange reason, the men seem to maintain a fast pace, keeping close to you far better than the hike yesterday.

[[“Alright, let’s stop for a break,”]] you suggest while pointing to some “comfortable” looking rocks.

Drew returns from his foraging efforts with a handful of pathetic looking raspberries which you gratefully accept. Evan is less graceful, grabbing a few from Drew’s pile.

“Ahhh! Woo...” Evans yawns audibly and stretches out. You catch him staring at you out of the corner of your eye. “How about a morale booster, Taylor?” Evan asks you.

“What do you mean?”

“Boobies are a universal cure-all,” he answers with a lazy grin.

“Unbelievable. We are lost out here and all you are thinking about are boobies?”

“You don’t have to show us, sheesh. After last night, I am not really sure what the big deal is. We are all friends here, right?” Evan throws the final question at Drew.

Drew blinks but quickly agrees. “Right!”

“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Evan adds, raising his shirt and rubbing his nipples.

You sigh. //Three hopeless idiots lost in the damned woods...//

You glare at Evan. “There are mosquitos out here.”

“So what? We still have bug spray. If I am going to die out here I want to die with a smile on my face.”

&quot;Wow. Every day? You must be my number one fan!&quot;

The fan blushes profusely.

You smile at him. &quot;Do you want an autograph?&quot;

&quot;Hell yes! Uhh I mean, yes please!&quot;

&quot;Heh. Do you have a piece of paper or something?&quot;

&quot;I have something better!&quot; the newcomer produces a picture of Natalie dressed as a sexy bad girl. &quot;You can sign in the white space.&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natbadgirl.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Before heading to bed you go to the washroom to wash your face and brush your teeth. As you splash your cheeks, your eyes catch those of your reflection. Natalie Prynn, stark and beautiful, stares back at you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natface.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Damn, I feel like I could turn men to stone with a glance...// It is plain that Natalie&#39;s beauty is a dangerous weapon. //A weapon I don&#39;t even know how to use properly...//

After making a few silly faces, you note that your impersonation is still flawless but due to the strain visible around your eyes you can tell it is taking a significant toll on you. It appears that for the first few hours you can wear a face without discomfort, but beyond that it becomes increasingly  fatiguing. //I guess wearing another face is like wearing contact lenses...//

&quot;I don&#39;t want to get pink-eye…&quot; you joke while you reattempt to release your transformation. &quot;Kcchh… ahhh…&quot;

It takes more effort than you expect to trigger a reversal but you finally manage to push the right mental buttons.

As your transformation fades, relief floods through your tired skin. Your features appear to deflate as they revert to their previous composition.

You feel a lot better returning to your original form.

&quot;Err…&quot; //This isn&#39;t my original form!// you correct yourself. It freaks you out a bit that you are starting to think that way. [[&quot;I have definitely been like this for way too long…&quot;]]

&quot;Hmm…&quot; You appraise the young man&#39;s broad face. He doesn&#39;t seem to be lying. //Still, his enthusiasm is definitely excessive...//

//Ah, whatever. He seems harmless enough.// You borrow a pen. Just as you are about to sign your name, you freeze.

//Fuck! I almost wrote &quot;Taylor!&quot; I don&#39;t know how Natalie signs her name!//

As if in response to your mental query, the modchip begins to tingle. Your anxiety melts away, replaced with a mind boggling amount of information regarding Natalie&#39;s mannerisms and writing style.

&quot;Who should I make it out to?&quot;

&quot;I am Franky!&quot;

&quot;Okay. To Franky, thanks for being my number one fan! Natalie Prynn,&quot; you narrate as you sign the photograph. You sign Natalie&#39;s name as easily as your own.

&quot;Wow. Natalie, you&#39;re even nicer than I imagined!&quot; remarks Franky. He is clearly star-struck.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Franky begins to rummage through his backpack. [[&quot;I have something for you!&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2260" name="&quot;I have something for you!&quot;" tags="" position="7636,24048" size="100,100">&quot;Look, Natalie! I drew this for you!&quot;

&quot;Aw, that is very nice of you!&quot; //Man, it must be so cool having fans! I bet Natalie gets heaps of fan mail every day!// &quot;Let&#39;s see.&quot;

Franky hands you a sketch.

Your jaw drops when you look at the drawing.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natdrawing.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ummm…&quot; //What. The. Fuck?// You are momentarily speechless.

&quot;What do you think!? I did my best!&quot;

&quot;Ah, it is… very realistic?&quot;

&quot;Thanks! I had to use my imagination for some parts.&quot; Franky&#39;s eyes widen as an idea occurs to him. &quot;It would be even more realistic if you modelled for me in person!&quot;

//You have got to be kidding! As if I would model for these sorts of perverted pictures!// You wince as it dawns on you that is what you were just doing minutes earlier.

&quot;No thanks, I am a busy… woman,&quot; you promptly refuse. &quot;It was nice meeting you, Franky… but I have to go.&quot;

&quot;Wait! You forgot your present!&quot;

You meet your guards outside the studio and hop in the car. You are soon whisked back to Natalie&#39;s apartment.

&quot;Thanks! It was nice meeting you Franky!&quot; you say while graciously accepting his pervy drawing. 

You exchange an extended goodbye before taking off. Once out of sight, you promptly deposit the gift in the nearest wastebasket.
&lt;&lt;set $franky to true&gt;&gt;
For a second you feel like you are being watched but you dismiss the feeling as your imagination after a quick look around.

Franky watches Natalie Prynn throw away his treasured gift like a piece of trash.

&quot;SHE THREW OUT MY DRAWING!? No, not Natalie… this… can&#39;t be!&quot;

His poor little heart shatters into a million pieces and a dark idea takes root in his young mind.

You meet your guards and hop in the car.

&quot;So what&#39;s your plan?&quot; you ask your client.

&quot;Well now that I have seen you, this is so exciting~! I doubt anyone could tell us apart.&quot;

&quot;That is kind of the idea, right?&quot;

Taylor purses her lips. &quot;Well I don&#39;t know if looking like me is enough.&quot;

You preempt Taylor&#39;s objection.  &quot;I have… uh, //trained// for this moment.  I think you will find me an excellent backup in most respects.&quot;

Taylor raises an eyebrow. &quot;You mean… you can sing?&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;OH-MY-GOD!  Follow me! I have to hear what you sound like!&quot;  Tay QS leads you upstairs, into a room outfitted as a studio.

Taylor taps a few keys at a computer screen.

[[&quot;Let&#39;s do a duet!&quot;]] Taylor suggests. &quot;Do you know the lyrics to //Heart Throb//?&quot; 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2264" name="&quot;Let&#39;s do a duet!&quot;" tags="" position="6630,21644" size="100,100">//Of course not! Wait...// A jolt seems to magically inject an encyclopedia of poetry and lyrics into your mind. //I know all Taylor&#39;s lyrics…? This chip thing is crazy!//

&quot;I am a huge fan of yours!&quot; you lie as smoothly as possible. &quot;I know the lyrics to every one of your songs by heart… even the really obscure ones.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Is that a challenge!?&quot; Taylor prompts you, her bright blue eyes sparkling like electrified sapphires.

With a tap of a button one of Taylor&#39;s hit songs, //Heart Throb//, begins to play. Taylor leads you in with with the intro, echoing the refrain. 

When it comes time for you to sing, you freeze up.

//I can&#39;t believe I am having a freaking sing along with Taylor Quicksilver!//

Your mind stalls for a split second but the sound of the music coupled with a subtle urging tingle from the incision behind your ear [[pushes you onward and into song.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2265" name="pushes you onward and into song." tags="" position="6786,21742" size="100,100">♫ &quot;When I met you, I knew that there was only one thing to do~&quot; ♫ you sing. The music seems to possess you. You sing like you&#39;re in the shower and no one is listening. Each lyric is delivered with increasing passion until they just seem to //flow// out of you.

Ms. Quicksilver sings the backup vocals and echoes the refrain at the end of the chorus.

You bounce the song verses back and forth in perfect time and finish the song&#39;s finality in unison.

&quot;♫ You make my heart thhhhrrooooob! ♫&quot; You sing, your voices harmonizing together with such ringing clarity that you and Taylor stare at each other in shock for a long time after the music recedes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ttsing.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Yikes… What just happened?//

&quot;Wow. WOW! You&#39;re a natural!&quot; Taylor shakes her head in apparent disbelief. &quot;I think you could even replace me… but you are just singing these songs, not //creating// them. How did you learn to sing anyway? And how the heck did you change yourself to look like me?&quot;

Unsure how to answer, you decide to play the mysterious card. &quot;A girl has to have her secrets!&quot;

Taylor taps her red lips thoughtfully. &quot;Your vocal range is really impressive… and eerily similar to my own,&quot; she observes. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not my long lost sister or something?&quot;

[[&quot;Uh, yeah, I am pretty sure,&quot;]] you dryly respond.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2266" name="&quot;Uh, yeah, I am pretty sure,&quot;" tags="" position="6634,21796" size="100,100">&quot;Okay, I am impressed. We can definitely get justice for Cody if you help me.&quot;

&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; you ask your client.

Taylor QS bites her lip. Her eyes narrow until she looks almost determined as she does cute. &quot;I have made some inquiries and have set up a meeting with a team of independent investigators,&quot; Taylor explains. &quot;I want you to distract my manager, Amelia. Give me a couple days and then I should have enough information to decide the appropriate steps to take next.&quot;

&quot;You want me to… do what exactly?&quot;

&quot;I have a busy schedule. I just need you to keep it while I get things in order.&quot;

&quot;Um.&quot; //Easier said than done.//

&quot;The next two days are a cinch! You look exactly like me and I&#39;ve heard you sing… so just smile and nod. Be polite. Simple. Amelia is pretty sharp, so be careful around her.&quot;

&quot;I will do my best,&quot; you reply.

You must come off as unsure becasure Taylor immediately reassures you, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re Team Taylor - we can&#39;t lose!&quot;

[[&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2267" name="&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;" tags="" position="6786,21894" size="100,100">Your enthusiasm is short lived. You nearly have a heart attack when Taylor presents you with your schedule. It is jam packed with events.

&quot;Hey- I may look like you but there is no way I can do all this stuff!&quot;

&quot;Just do your best. As long as you smile and look cute you&#39;re golden. Trust me, I know this stuff.&quot;

As your eyes ghost around Taylor&#39;s lavish mansion, you feel your confidence rejuvenate.

&quot;I will do my best,&quot; you repeat your pledge.

&quot;Taylor - You-are-the-best!&quot;

&quot;How should I act around Amelia?&quot;

&quot;Hm. Well I have kind of a weird relationship with her… she is kind of like a mother hen. She is usually blunt. I liked her assertiveness originally but I see now that trait is a bit of a two edged sword...&quot;

&quot;You mean she bullies you?&quot;

Taylor blushes. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it that way… I hired her because I thought she would look out for my best interests, even if she is a bit… //out there.//&quot;

[[&quot;Can&#39;t you just fire her?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2268" name="&quot;Can&#39;t you just fire her?&quot;" tags="" position="6634,21948" size="100,100">Taylor gasps. &quot;Oh no! I couldn&#39;t do that… She has done a lot for me.&quot;

//And what if she took out Cody?// you wonder. The grim thought sticks with you.

&quot;Let&#39;s get started.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing. Thanks for doing this, Taylor!&quot; the young performer whispers to and gives you a friendly kiss on the cheek. &quot;We will meet up here in two days. I already called Amelia, so you should be good to go until lunch. It&#39;s just a barbecue, so just go and eat a hotdog and...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t forget to smile?&quot;

&quot;You are a natural!&quot;

Once Taylor has left, you look at your schedule.

&quot;Alright. First up BBQ lunch for a charity fundraiser. Mmmm…. That does sound tasty. Do I have the weirdest and best job ever now!?&quot;

//Except for the potential murderer on the loose part… and the fact I&#39;m a chick...// 

You call a car service and head to the park where the fundraiser is taking place. You spend your afternoon with a weiner in hand, awkwardly smiling for crowds of adoring fans.

EoC :( More Taylor QS adventure coming soon!
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2269" name="I promise I will take real good care of you.”" tags="" position="13442,26857" size="100,100">You realize it would be far too easy to just fall into Louise’s arms but something within you urges caution. “Louise… I am new to this whole thing.”

“Why the hesitation? I will be gentle at first… and girls are much softer than guys. Plus I know all the good spots on a woman’s body… And, besides, we are both hot //and// I just bought you dinner.”

“You didn’t pay for it…” you note.

“Sure I did!” Louise objects. “I paid with my smarts. I am not a deadbeat or anything. I have money. For the record, money is fuckin’ easy to get. I got the voice, the body, and a talent for crafting lyrics. I am the whole package,” Lou brags. “The only thing I don’t have is a pretty girlfriend…”

Louise suddenly kisses you. You are swept away by an onslaught of hungry kisses that lasts until you are long past the point of breathless.

“Now, my dear little deer, are you coming home with me or not?” Louise asks you, her eyes brimming with desire. Louise stares you down, imperious as a lioness overlooking her pride.

//Ahh… If she looks at me like that...  // Captivated, you stare back at Louise. Perhaps it is inevitable that prey should fall to a predator. Maybe you are just like Bambi staring doe eyed towards a man with a rifle.

[[Go home with Louise]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2270" name="Go home with Louise" tags="" position="13586,26951" size="100,100">Swept up in Louise’s spell, you follow her home like a lost puppy. You makeout for the entire length of the elevator ride to the top floor.

Louise kicks open the door to her messy apartment and pushes you down onto her bed.

She pounces on you with a display of feline athleticism. You let her tear your clothes off you.

With excitement building, Lou descends upon you, pressing her hot tongue into your tight little pussy.

“Aaee.... Ahhh!” The sudden simulation makes you cry out and clamp down on Louise’s agile tongue.

Encouraged by your response, Lou eats you with a hungry passion that both terrifies and excites you at the same time.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/loucun.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnnghhh! Stoooop…”

“I love the way you squirm, Bambi… I want you to cum for me,” Lou hoarsely urges you. “Show me how much you love having my tongue inside you!”

You try to hold back Lou’s attack, but your efforts lack strength. Soon you are twirling your fingers through your lover’s hair [[while she tongues you into another dimension and back.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2271" name="while she tongues you into another dimension and back." tags="" position="13446,27005" size="100,100">Louise’s actions are firm, bordering on rough, yet her hands and body are nearly as soft as your own.

“Hwaaahhh…” Toe to head tip, you feel warm tingles cascade through your body.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tongueslit.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You shudder as your orgasm seizes hold of you. It is hard not to revel in the sensation of pleasure as you flood with love juice while Lou eagerly laps up every drop that you produce.

Louise ravishes your body with her hands and tongue until you’re certain you have reached the pinnacle of natural highs.

Your session with Louise passes by far too quickly. This is one of those moments of your life where five hours feels more like five minutes.

“Oh fuck, Bambi… watching you squirm like this is making me so fucking hard.”

“Hard…?” Louise grabs your hand and directs onto her pussy. You can feel her engorged clit, while in full few of your partner’s puffy, erect nipples. 

[[“Now do me,”]] Louise growls at you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2272" name="“Now do me,”" tags="" position="13586,27099" size="100,100">“Hwahhh…” You wipe the drool from your chin and shake your head to dispel your swimming vision. When your eyes refocus, they land on Louise’s face, pale skin red lips, and darkened blue eyes.

After experiencing such pleasure at Louise’s hands, you can hardly refuse her. Louise is sexy yet intimidating. Maybe your transformation is a blessing in disguise if it means allowing you the possibility to have sex with Lou.

You roll over and lower your face between Louise’s tattooed thighs.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/loureciprocate.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your nose presses into Lou’s cleft. Lou’s pungent but delightfully intoxicating musk fills your senses.

Your new friend is already excited judging by the amount of overflowing juices you discover. Doing your best to imitate Lou’s earlier actions, you roll your tongue over her rosebud down into the center of her feminine folds.

You do your best to get Louise off, burying your face in her crotch.

Just as you are about to decry your sore jaw and tongue, Louise grabs your hair and forces you down hard onto her clit. You let the powerful young woman ride your face hard as she cums, covering your face with her erotic emissions.

[[You leave Lou’s apartment feeling like a new person.]]

Your lack of space and strength make your attack ineffective. You drum your fists on the chubby molester’s chest to no avail.

“This is not happening to me!”

“Yoooou smell sooooo good!” the pig-like man yells in your ear. He leans over you, sniffing the top of your head.

“Don’t fucking touch me!!” You scream but your voice is crushed under the massive output of the stage’s twelve foot tall speakers.

The song’s tempo increases and the crowd blessedly shifts enough for you to squirm ahead. You look over your shoulder and are disgusted to see the chubby molester guy sniffing his fingers.

//His fingers that were just inside me… Fuck my life… Being a girl is fuckin’ shitty!// You wish you had your old body so that you could kick the guy’s ass.

“Whatever! Grr…” You sigh, realizing it is probably best to sanction this particular memory. “I need another drink… Wait a sec...”

Your pockets feel abnormally light.  You pat at them out of confusion.  //Fuck!  [[Did that weirdo steal my freaking wallet!?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2275" name="Did that weirdo steal my freaking wallet!?" tags="" position="5828,13203" size="100,100">Luckily, you still have your phone intact.

While unleashing a litany of curses, you stomp off from the stage area.

“Fuck this! I have had enough. I am going home,” you grumble while texting Drew that you are leaving early.

You leave the crowds behind and exit the concert venue..

“Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck! It is so hot, even Hades is running his A/C right now!” you remark while squinting at the setting sun that is still giving off a shimmer of heat despite the late hour.

Jogging up to your yard as the last of the daylight fades, you are eager for a cold shower and some internet fueled distractions.

“I can’t believe that fucking asshole. I should learn some krav maga or some shit. The next guy that tries anything like it is getting his hand broken!”

You have a cold shower but that relief is short lived. You toss and turn for an hour. You find that even a thin sheet is too much covering under these hellish circumstances.

You fall asleep naked, sleeping intermittently until a loud noise wakes you up in the middle of the night.

//Crrashhh! Bang! Whack!// You hear a succession of loud noises erupt from downstairs.

[[“Huh…? What the hell?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2276" name="“Huh…? What the hell?”" tags="" position="6000,13261" size="100,100">//Did someone just break into my fucking house!?

The next twenty seconds are dead quiet. Just as you begin to relax, you hear the creak of someone ascending the stairs.

//No fucking way! Please don’t be an axe-murderer!//

Heart pounding, you turn to the doorway.

//Maybe it’s Julie… It has to be Julie!// you assure yourself.

After a few seconds to gather your courage, you bravely enter the hallway in the buff, wielding a vase defensively in hand.

The hall and stairway are empty. While trying desperately to moderate the sound of your breathing, you creep down into the living room.

You stop dead in your tracks when you spot a tall figure standing shrouded in darkness.  

//Fuck. Fuck. FUCK!//

“Hello!? Who’s there!?” you shout. Your fingers find the light switch. The illuminated room reveals a sinister looking pile of coats and an open window. A plastic jug and magazine have blown off the counter.

You breathe a sigh of relief. “Whew… Holy shit, Taylor...  When did I become such a scaredy cat?”

You close the window and return to bed.

[[It takes you a couple of minutes to fully relax.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2277" name="It takes you a couple of minutes to fully relax." tags="" position="5832,13351" size="100,100">You close your eyes and begin to count sheep, slowing drifting off to sleep… until you feel your mattress move.

“Hmm?”

“Your room is really nice, Taylor,” compliments a raspy voice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/nakedintruder.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Huh?” Your terror levels go from zero to maximum in the space of a heartbeat. “Ahhhhhhhh! Gwwaaaah! Mhhhgfaah!” Your cries are muffled by a sweaty hand.

A familiar heavy man climbs on top of you.

//It’s that fucking freak from the concert! How did he figure out where I- oh shit, my wallet!//

“I know what your pussy smells like, Taylor. You don’t have to hide your true self from me. I came because I wanted to see you again.”
 
While holding his hand over your mouth, the big man’s other hand finds its way between your legs.

You are blinded by a flashlight and pinned down.

“I knew it! You really are a girl!”

“Mmmnnrrrooo!” //No I’m not!//

[[“My senses never lie!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2278" name="“My senses never lie!”" tags="" position="5989,13402" size="100,100">You whimper in defeat as the would-be rapist begins to violently grope and paw at you. Your panic worsens as the man lies down beside you. Eye to eye, you get a clear sense the intruder is insane. While smiling eerily at you, he finds a comfortable position and then rams his thick fingers inside your pussy.

“Hnnngggmmrraaa! Mmmrraa...”

The rapist’s calloused fingers work their way into your dry flesh. His fingers roll over your clit and deeper into your feminine cleft with every repetition. Despite your terror, your body seems to have a mind of its own. After a few awful minutes, your flesh responds, giving way to the stimulation by naturally lubricating itself. 

You lose track of time. With every passing breath, you also cede ground in your battle to maintain your pride.

//Schlick-schlick-schhhllliiick!// 

Judging by the sounds emanating from you it is plain you are aroused. He continues to fingerbang you [[until the pressure inside you builds to critical limits.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2279" name="until the pressure inside you builds to critical limits." tags="" position="5837,13500" size="100,100">
//Ohhh nooo… What’s happening to me!? This body just keeps reacting! Why won’t these feelings stop!? Am I going to cum? Nooooo!//

You reach your limit and orgasm hard, flopping around in the arms of a horrible, nameless man.

After he forces you to cum, the intruder removes his sticky hand from your crotch. “Don’t you dare scream,” he warns.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/altconcertfingered.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Noo…. Ah…”

Tears stream down your face as you are viciously finger fucked until your sensitive body yields a second time.

“Fwaahhh… Hwahh.. Why are you doing this to me?”

“All I am doing is making you feel good,” answers the molester. “You should thank me. Now let’s get on to the main course, shall we, Taylor?”

//“Main course?”// You yelp in shock as the man begins to fumble with his pants. “No way! You can’t do this!”

&quot;Yes I can.&quot;

“Please no! I am a virgin!”

[[“Not for long.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2280" name="“Not for long.”" tags="" position="5985,13554" size="100,100">The invader grabs your shoulder and turns you over. He pushes your head down into the space between your pillows and roughly pulls your ass up by the hips. 

You are already naked, defenceless, and tired from the concert. You are no match for the big man.

“Alright, let’s finish what we started on the dance floor!” he says with a chuckle.

You squeal in distress as you are fucked by a man for the first time. Your hymen is obliterated with one thrust of the rapist’s cock.

Part of you can’t believe what is happening but the pain and incredibly weird feeling of having a penis inside you marks the experience as all too real.

With two orgasms flooding your love canal, the man slides into you with minimal effort despite the obvious tightness. Your lower half firmly grips his cock, nestled tightly within your feminine flesh.

“Noooo…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rape3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
He covers your mouth with his hands and uses your face as leverage to pull your body back into his pistoning flesh.

//Thwap. Thwap. Fap-fap-fap-fap...//

“Uh, uh… uh… Your first time is mine. You belong to me!”

The moment you dread the most approaches. The pig’s breathing becomes more ragged, his thrusts more frantic, and it is clear that he is about to climax.

//He is going to do it inside of me!//

You feel every pulse and convulsion of the rapist’s cock in disgusting detail as he coats your internals with copious amounts of cum.

Your hope that the ordeal is over is dashed when the cock hardens inside you. He slowly begins to pump in and out of you, using his seed as lubricant. He picks up speed and gains size until you are being fucked with a primal intensity that exceeds the first round.

Your mind shuts off, or tries to.

[[You are brutally raped to the point of exhaustion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2281" name="You are brutally raped to the point of exhaustion." tags="" position="5837,13656" size="100,100">In the morning you wake up hopeful the last night was just a dream.

That hope is shattered before you even become fully conscious. 

You are sore and covered with a white crusty substance. There is a naked, heavy-set man lying beside you.

//Oh god… Why is he still here!?//

You touch your genitals and are horrified when your fingers come back stained with bloody semen.

Tears welling in your eyes, you attempt to escape.

Just as you are about to roll off the mattress, a hand shoots out and pulls you back.

“I wanted to talk to you before I left.”

You can’t even stand to look at this disgusting man.

“I have nothing to say to you. Just go… I promise I won’t say anything.”

“That’s a given. But I want more.”

You feel an ominous sense of dread rising inside you. “What do you mean?”

“I know your secret! Taylor Roux… once a man… now a woman. Your ID card doesn’t lie.”

You feel the blood drain from your face.

//This isn’t good… I don’t want to be blackmailed by this fucking tub of shit!//

You nervously lick your noticeably dry lips.  “What the hell do you want from me?”

“I want a hot girlfriend.  //I want you, Taylor.//”

“But you know I am not a real girl!” you protest.

“I checked your equipment in detail. You’re all woman. You make me so horny I can’t think about anyone else! When I saw you at the concert… It was love at first sight.”

[[“That is pretty one sided.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2282" name="“That is pretty one sided.”" tags="" position="5985,13706" size="100,100">“So? You will love me eventually. When I first found your ID, I couldn’t believe it. You are obviously trying to hide your transition.”

“Oh shit…”

“Be my girlfriend and I will keep your secret. Otherwise I promise that things will get really complicated. I can put out the info on the net and the university forum… as well as some pictures I took last night if you aren’t willing to be a good girl.”

“No way… How can I trust you, you’re a fucking rapist! You broke into my damned house! How did you get through that small window anyway?”

“I came in through the door… But the fact that I broke in here shows you that you shouldn’t betray me. I already know a lot of //intimate// details about you.”

“...”

“Be my girlfriend!”

“I don’t even know your name…”

“You can call me Jack,” he answers with a proud nod, as if his late introduction could nullify your legion of concerns.

If this guy publicly humiliates you there is a chance whatever entity is responsible for your transformation will get word. All of your long cultivated relationships with friends and family could be ruined.

In order to preserve a chance to escape, you are forced to accept the rapist’s arrangement.

The next day, your [[blackmail boyfriend arrives to take advantage of his new prize.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2283" name="blackmail boyfriend arrives to take advantage of his new prize." tags="" position="5837,13808" size="100,100">“This is your new life now!” Jack says as he thrusts his cock into your mouth.

//My new life…? I hope this is a very brief chapter...//

“Suck it!” Jack orders.

Seeing no alternative, you do your best to please Jack.

Jack takes control of his pleasure in the final moments. He pushes your head down and then begins to jerk off into your open mouth.

“Ahh fuck yeah! Take it all! Don’t miss a drop… Ahhh… Swallow it…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/newlife.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You suck out the semen while the cock softens in your mouth.

“Hwaahh…” //Such a gross taste…// you think as you choke down the foul load.

“Getting you to be my girlfriend is the best decision I have ever made,” Jack asserts.

“I wish I could agree…”

“Lighten up, Taylor. I got lots of spunk for you today.”

You try and search for a cure for your condition but you are soon too distracted by Jack [[that your pursuit becomes neutered.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2284" name="that your pursuit becomes neutered." tags="" position="6000,13825" size="100,100">Your pudgy rapist “boyfriend” loses nearly his entire paunch within a month. He burns so many calories fucking you each day that you reach a point of no return. You have gotten used to having sex. The revulsion still remains but it has been dulled by routine.

Jack arrives late one afternoon. He strips you down in the living room and takes you from behind on the couch, in full view of an open window and passers by on the street.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/couchfucktoomuch.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Stop! Someone will see us!”

“So what?”

Your protests are interrupted as you get repeatedly speared by a fat cock.

//If anyone sees us, I hope they will just think it is Julie...//

You endure the thorough fuck session as quietly as possible. You manage to succeed, until you glance out the window and see &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Drew&quot; &quot;Drew (Drewdesc)&quot;&gt;&gt; walking up the pathway to your house.

//Noooooooooooooooooo!//

“Jack! Stop!” you whisper.

“I am almost done,” Jack huffs. He humps you with greater impetus, evoking a cry from your lips.

You hear Drew’s voice and feel elation coupled with fear. “Taylor? Are you in here?” You spot Drew’s face appear in the window out of the corner of your eye.

Drew looks at you with a level of shock and disbelief that would be funny if it wasn’t so awful.

An open-mouthed Drew watches you get fucked.  He does nothing but stare. //Does he think I want this!?  Why in the fuck isn’t he helping me?  Is it because of what I said before at the concert?  Nooooo!  Drew!  Help me; I didn’t mean it! I don’t want this!//

Jack notices Drew peeking in the window and chuckles. He pulls the blinds shut and continues fucking you. You endure in tense silence but Drew never comes to your rescue.

You lose friend after friend and get stuck in one of life’s ruts. Eventually you have no one left except Jack… which is probably what he planned all along.

Upon waking, you take again Natalie&#39;s appearance as your own. The transformation takes longer than normal. Your flesh feels a bit stiff. You feel relieved once you manage to get Natalie&#39;s face to stick.
&lt;&lt;set $ftaylor to false&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $nat to true&gt;&gt;
You have breakfast with Natalie and Pierre. Afterwards, Natalie leads you into her private fitting room.

She holds up an expensive looking dress.

You sigh as you check your schedule. //Looks like more dress-up fun...// &quot;Do I really have to wear //that// to the party?&quot;

&quot;Of course! You have to dress the part!&quot; Natalie insists. &quot;And I picked this dress out. It is super cute and fashionable.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s //nice.//&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t look so blue!&quot; Natalie chides you. &quot;It will be fun.&quot;

Natalie passes you a dress, an open fronted halter made from a silky dark fabric pleated with gold ornaments. To make matters worse, Natalie holds up two Christmas tree decorations. 

Overwhelmed and confused you speak up. &quot;Uh, what are those?&quot;

&quot;They are your //earrings,// silly!&quot; Natalie clips them on.

&quot;Holy fuck, now I feel like I have actual Christmas trees dangling from my ears…&quot;

Unwilling to disappoint Natalie, you bite your tongue and get dressed.

Hosts of adoring fans shower you with praise. Everyone looks at you with such warmth, you can&#39;t help but be a little touched by Natalie and the image she has cultivated.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natgala.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You silently pray that you don&#39;t come off as too bewildered. //That&#39;s right, for Natalie this is all just boring, routine stuff!//

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natgala2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The whole affair becomes increasingly awkward, although you quickly master the smile and nod tactic.

With the help of your modchip, with it&#39;s odd guiding memories and urges, you think you are able to convince nearly everyone that you are the real deal.

By the time you finally get back to the apartment, you have [[been on your feet with awkward shoewear for over twelve hours.]]

You strip off your awkward clothing and walk to the bathroom.

//Alright, that&#39;s enough Natalie for today...//

&quot;Hnnng… Huh?&quot;

No matter how hard you try to reverse your transformation, your face remains unchanged.

&quot;Ugg… Fuck! Why can&#39;t I change back!? Come oooon!&quot; 

//This is bad! What if I get stuck like this? Oh man, my life is already weird enough as it is!//

&quot;Maybe Natalie would hire me as a stand in for her movies?&quot; you remark, half jokingly.

You are reminded of a childish incident, when you kept making faces at Julie in response to her teasing. Your sister warned: &quot;If you keep scowling that, your face will get stuck like that!&quot;

&quot;Damnit…&quot; What if such a thing was really possible? &quot;It has to be the stress! Maybe a bath will help loosen me up…?&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/natbath.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&quot;Ughh... Damn, I don&#39;t feel so hot…&quot; Your limbs and joints are stiff. More alarmingly, your face is almost completely numb. To top everything off, you have a headache.

&quot;Ahh what am I going to do now? I guess another day like this won&#39;t hurt. I just need some coffee!&quot; you remark as you dress in a daze before heading to the kitchen for breakfast.

While eating a light breakfast of oatmeal, you realize you have a small window of time before your next job.

A random reminder flits through your mind. //That&#39;s right, I did bring a book I&#39;ve been wanting to read...//

After looting your backpack for a copy of a new fantasy release, you crack open the cover, stopping yourself to consider the possibility you might be more comfortable reading in the park outside.

Uh mmmmm…. Eh? Hnnnnnnnmmm… Fuck! //It still doesn&#39;t work!//&quot;

You imagine your previous face and will it into existence. Despite your best efforts, your features remain unchanged.

&quot;What the fuck!? C&#39;mon //release!//&quot;

You nearly pop a vein in your forehead in the attempt but you are unable to return to your female form.

&quot;Maybe I have spent too much time like this? Damnit!&quot; Your lack of understanding of your condition and the strange powers it has granted you is an ordeal in frustration.

Yawning loudly, you hop into bed. &quot;Ah, whatever... I am probably just way too tired.&quot;

When you crawl into bed, you suddenly are wide awake.

&quot;Well, this is technically my body even if I do look like Natalie. It is totally fine if I rub one out!&quot; you rationalize.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/nataliemast.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You work your fingers into the soft flesh of your pussy until you begin to leak love nectar all over Natalie’s bed.

“Hnn… Ahhnn… This body is so… Ahhh!” Your fingers pump faster and faster until you trigger your release. You grind your hips and sodden sex into your hand while you ride the waves of your shuddering orgasm. Once your orgasm fades, you calm down enough to fall asleep.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/friendsflash.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You let the two idiots ogle your chest.

When you lower your shirt both men sigh with disappointment. Evan looks like he is in pain. “Taylor, please just show us the rest.”

“For fuck’s sake, guys! Get your heads on straight! We can’t keep doing shit like this!”

Evan is unswayed. “Sure we can. You have an amazing body… and I don’t think it is too much to ask for something to keep my mind off my impending death of exposure in the woods for a silly quest taken on your behalf.”

Evan’s insane argument makes increasing sense the longer you think about it. Everything happening is directly or indirectly your fault. 

[[You decide to take responsibility for your decisions.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/woodsmotivate.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“You’re the best friend ever!” Evan compliments you as you pull your shirt over your head.

Drew makes incoherent gurgling noises as he watches you undress.

“See? Drew agrees too!” Evan laughs.

You share a moment of levity with your friends as they watch you hop around combating the swarm of mosquitos that rises to prey on your bare flesh.

Much to their disappointment, you are soon forced to get dressed.

“I hope that was fucking worth it for you guys!” you say once you are redressed.

“Yeah! I feel totally restored!” Evan replies while slapping his chest.

You are scratching at itchy welts for the next two hours. Luckily your sacrifice seems to have paid off, for [[Evan and Drew do not utter a word of complaint.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2294" name="Evan and Drew do not utter a word of complaint." tags="" position="398,16304" size="100,100">You keep hiking until the muscles in your legs threaten to seize up.

“Fuuuah!” you cry out as you trip on a root and nearly fall on your face. “Damnit, it’s getting dark!”

“We are so fucking lost,” Evan grumbles. He scowls at Drew, clearly blaming him for your current circumstances.

Drew doesn’t appear to be listening, his head is lost in the darkening sky above. “Polaris!” Drew gasps.

Evan scratches his head. “What?”

“//Polaris!//” Drew repeats.

“Oh, I see! The North Star!” you clarify.

“Huh? You guys want to move at night?” Evan wonders.

Drew shakes his head. “At least we know which direction to head. We will hit a road or something eventually. I am surprised we haven’t yet.”

After setting up camp, the three of you bunk down for the second uncomfortable night of your impromptu hiking adventure.

Everyone is so tired from the long day that you are soon asleep despite the uncomfortable circumstances.

The next morning, you head due north with your two friends in tow.

You walk for an hour until you come to a significant obstacle.

You look down at the jagged cliff face and frown.

“I can get down there,” appraises Evan. You nod.

Drew seems far less certain. “I don’t think I can get down there with my skull intact.”

[[“Evan and I will scout it first!”]]

You catch Sam’s eye but she breaks contact. Feeling small and ashamed, you watch as your most fantasized crush rubs her neck and turns away. Apparently your embarrassment is contagious. //Great job, Taylor! Really great impression you are making!//

After a couple minutes of laughter, the game gradually takes back the attention of the group.

Although you want to quit, Rhea pushes you a chip and speed deals the cards so that you have three in front of you before you can voice your intent to leave.

//Fucking here we go again...//

You peak at your hand and can barely contain your surprise.

You are far from a poker expert or math whizz but you know you have drawn a //really fucking good// hand.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hand.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The cards dealt in the river only increases your confidence.

“Hmm!” Jimmy leans forward, his eyes wide with exaggerated fright. “Uh oh! I bet she has  awesome cards. I am out.” Jimmy’s sudden folding makes you very nervous. 

//Fuck, I hope this doesn’t backfire!//

Yet Sam appears unfazed. She matches you raise for raise.

“Oooo… It looks like these two girls are determined to get to the bottom of things. I wouldn’t mind seeing either of them naked,” Rhea says to the men at the table.

Evan and Jimmy rumble agreement.

Your card duel with Sam intensifies and quickly reaches the point where the cards must be laid on the table.

“Alright, this is for all the marbles-er //panties!//” you say as you set down your cards with a feeling of invincibility.

You are rewarded with shocked gasps as people admire your rare hand.

“See? Told ya!” Jimmy laughs.

Everyone looks at Samantha and her hoard of chips… [[most of which now belong to you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2297" name="most of which now belong to you." tags="" position="3448,10295" size="100,100">Sam stands up and smiles shyly at you. “It was fun guys, but I am going to call it a night.”

Jimmy voices his disappointment. “Boooo! You can’t go yet! The party is just getting started.” 

“Sorry, everyone. I am really tired…”

Rhea joins the chorus of discontentment but Samantha has already retreated to the entryway. She plays with a lock of reddish hair as she hops anxiously from foot to foot while she puts her shoes on. You would almost suspect she is //nervous,// but that doesn’t really make any sense under the current circumstances. //Why would Sam be anxious around me?// The reverse is of course true, but that is only natural.

Sam leaves the party in a state of distress. You follow after her without a second thought.

Sam jumps as you close in on her. “I wanted to walk you home,” you explain. 

Samantha doesn’t answer. She just smiles sadly at you, letting you fall in line. You walk side by side to a park situated next to the female dormitories.

“Sam, why did you leave so early?” you ask her. “Was it something I did?” 

Your question clearly makes the young woman uncomfortable. Sam’s blushing is visible even under the star studded twilight. She seems momentarily unwilling to meet your gaze. [[Sam turns away from you and begins to fidget.]]

“Yeah, I guess,” you say as you sit down next to Sam, who shimmies an extra inch away from you.

//Why is she acting so weird? Wait a second...// Sam’s suddenly awkward behaviour reminds you a bit of your own. //Huh!?! Are my feelings mutual? No fucking way! But that kind of makes sense in a weird way...//

“Sam, do you… like me?” The words leave your lips before you even realize what you’re saying.

Your question clearly startles Samantha. Her bright eyes ghost over your body as she shyly looks away to gaze at the glittering stars above. “You’re very pretty,” she diplomatically answers.

//Uggghh...// “Uhh, thanks? I meant before this happened to me, when I was a guy…”

Your question makes Samantha freeze. She takes a deep breath and meets your gaze dead on. [[“I thought you were cute,”]] she admits.

“Are you alright, Taylor?” Sam asks you, her voice dripping with concern.

The world spins around you. Powerless but to obey the fool within you, your reply is: 

[[“No! I am not alright!”]]
[[“Yeah, I am fine. It’s nothing...”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2300" name="“No! I am not alright!”" tags="" position="3309,10497" size="100,100">“No! I am not alright!” you shout.

You feel the need to be honest. //Life can change so quickly... //

Your words come out in a tidal wave of emotion. “Everything is wrong! I just… I //really// liked you… //like// you… I have had a crush on you...for a long, long time,” you confess, your voice quivering. “And now I am like this…”

Your blunt admission makes Sam’s bright blue eyes go wide in surprise. To your horror, after an awkward minute or so, Sam starts to //giggle.//

You feel your self confidence crumble into the wind.

Sam then bites her lip and touches her mouth with a single slender finger.  “You mean like...//romantically//?” she clarifies.  [[You inwardly cringe as your internal panic meter rises to critical levels.]]

You feel like an idiot.  You should have made your affections known while you had the chance…  //But I still have this one…  Fuck,  I may not have my body but at least I am with Sam.//  

You are now incredibly nervous.  It feels like a great fly swatter of rejection is about to descend from the clouds and crush you at any moment.

Her eyes sparkle at you. One look at Sam’s mercurial smile threatens to crush your heart.

//Okay, maybe it is a bit funny...// The whole situation would be somewhat hilarious… if it wasn’t happening to you. Yet the scenario is so absurd you can’t help but join Sam.

“Ahh… I needed that. I haven’t really had much laughter in my life lately,” Sam says when her mirth subsides.

“Well, I am glad my fucked up life is worth a few laughs. I guess we both could use some comedy...”

“Oh, don’t worry. I wasn’t laughing at you. I was laughing //with// you.”

Lately your life seems fraught with with insanity. But here with Sam you feel more at peace than at any point in recent history.

It is always better to laugh than cry.

You decide to be more open about your feelings. “You are //really// pretty, Samantha.” 

“Thanks! You’re not so bad yourself…” Sam replies without missing a beat. Her words come off more playful than insulting.

Together with Sam, you watch the stars come out. Both of you seem to enjoy the quiet company.

You stargaze next to Samantha  until it gets cold.

Eventually, Sam’s yawn prompts her departure. [[You exchange your goodbyes and walk home.]]

//Isn’t that what I just said? Fuck!  I really was invisible to her...// 

Sam smiles fondly at you and says, “Sorry!  I never knew… I am kind of a ditz sometimes when it comes to romantic stuff!”

“I guess we have that in common…”

Sam proceeds to go into detail relating a childhood story involving a sneak out attempt to meet up with friends.

“And so then I was grounded for like three months….”

“That sucks!”

“Mhmm!  Then there was the old: “No dating until you are out of the house…” I think my dad added that one just to protect my naivety for another year beyond eighteen.  But, hah!

With effortless grace, she twirls in the starlight, shining bright and beautiful, her fiery radiance captivating you to your very core.

//Samantha...// The young woman’s spontaneous happiness strikes a chord with you.

The two of you fade into silence until Sam breaks it with laughter.

“Hahahehehe! Oh, Taylor! I can’t believe you had a crush on me. This is pretty funny, isn’t it?”

“Yeah! I could always use another girlfriend.”

“Er…”

“Taylor, if you ever need any help with girl stuff just let me know!”

&quot;Thanks...&quot;

You stargaze until it gets cold.

Eventually, Sam’s yawn prompts her departure. [[You exchange your goodbyes and walk home.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2306" name="You exchange your goodbyes and walk home." tags="" position="3304,10887" size="100,100">Your revelation concerning Sam has forced you into a state of alertness. Your mind races a mile a minute. You are so preoccupied with regret and fantasy that it takes you three hours to fall asleep.

The next day, you feel lonely. You begin to talk to yourself, eager to fill the silence. “Last night was intense…”  Your time with Sam has triggered a lot of introspective analysis. //I can’t believe I was clueless… How many great opportunities did I pass up in my life because I am such a pussy? I shouldn’t have held back so much...//

“Ahhh!” you shake your head in frustration. Your wishes for a time machine are just fantasies. Your chronic inaction now makes you feel extraordinarily foolish…  At least Sam’s admission helps a bit in the confidence department. //I can’t believe Sam thought I was cute…// 

You accidentally drop a pencil and in the process of retrieval, your vision lands on what appears to be a pile of trash hidden under your bed.

On a whim, you retrieve the pile. “Ahh… this is left over //that.//” This particularly impulsive online purchase set you back over a hundred bucks. You had hidden away your //action figure// once Julie started bugging you by calling your prized possessions //dolls//. Her attempts to annoy you worked marvelously.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/research.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Although you have a bunch of ideas, you find it difficult to search for something relevant. You spend an hour scrolling through countless pages of antiques and rarities. //I guess magic gender bending cures are even more scarce than I thought...//

//Click. Click. Click...//

“Uhhh…” You pull up a strange webstore selling a “blessed” rabbit’s foot for forty five dollars plus an abnormally high shipping fee for close to the list price. “Am I really considering buying an animal&#39;s foot? Fuck me! I doubt the occult will save me. I need science not this bullshit,” you rationalize.

Still, you feel inexplicably drawn to the store’s oddly alluring sidebar. The seller with the rabbit’s foot also has a large number of other unusual items.

“Is that a fucking //thumb//? Ew… Who would bid on something like that? Oh shit, it’s at two hundred bucks!”

Unsure if you should risk wasting precious time, you decide to:

Most seem to be embellished with a no-doubt made up legend to enhance the value of an otherwise valueless item. You note several of the most exorbitantly priced items supposedly possess magical powers, at least according to their often completely ridiculous descriptions that sound like they are ripped from a shitty fantasy video game.

“Authentic witch’s broom my ass! And that gold skull is definitely plated given its bid of three dollars... What a bunch of junk! Who is gullible enough to buy this crap?”

Your eyes fall on an “enchanted” amulet selling for a current bid of two hundred dollars.

“Enchantment, Pfft… Hm… Ehhh? Wait a second…” You suddenly perk up. A chill runs down your spine as you closely inspect the listing’s photograph. Your keen eyes zero in on a partially visible marking, the initials S.K. are clearly showing. “That is //Samantha’s stolen necklace!// [[I am fucking sure of it!]]”

You shake off your disbelief, leaving a sense of awe lingering in it&#39;s place. There is a lengthy moment where you feel almost moved to tears. 

“YESSS!!” you cheer so loudly a nearby bird on your window sill takes flight. Your luck has been shitty lately. It was more than due for a reversal.

//Samantha and I are meant to be! This chance is… like a gift from God! I have to get Sam’s necklace back! If I can do that...//

An incredibly vivid fantasy coalesces in your mind. You are flooded with endorphins and adrenaline. Success would mean you get to be Samantha’s knight in shining armor. //A life with Sam...// Your path in life becomes crystal clear; the way to an idyllic life with the woman you have always dreamed of could easily begin with recovering Samantha’s necklace.

The easiest method of acquisition seems to be straightforward. Unwilling to lose a precious chance, you start to aggressively bid for the necklace.

You are quickly outbid beyond your maximum capacity to pay.

“Fuuuuuuuuuuck!!! What am I going to do!?” You feel your anxiety rise as the auction counter dwindles. “I can’t let this chance slip away! Sam....”

[[Put in a high bid anyway]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2311" name="Put in a high bid anyway" tags="" position="3302,11191" size="100,100">“Ahh, screw it!”

Uncaring about the financial repercussions, you continue to aggressively bid, raising your price in a mad bidding war until the final second elapses.

“Holy fucking shit. Yikes... I just spent eleven grand on a fucking enchanted amulet…” //I guess it really is priceless, since it belongs to Sam… but yikes… Who needs tuition anyway?//

The auction site is prompting you to pay.

“Uh oh.” //How the hell am I going to pay for this!?// “I guess I can’t obviously… At least I have taken it off the market… temporarily. But now what?” You are unsure how to proceed.

Drew seems grateful for a chance to rest. “Be careful.”

You begin the treacherous climb down the steep slope. You slide part of the way down as loose gravel and rocks give way.

Evan manages to find an easier route. You join him and find yourself on another ledge overlooking a river.

“Should we jump?” Evan wonders.

You look down at the swirling cauldron of white water and shake your head.

“Well, we just have to keep climbing.” Evan lets himself down over the ledge. “Ahhh! Shit!” Evan yells as his grip gives way, dropping him into the water below.

“EVVVAAAN!” you shout as you scramble after him.

Evan pops up fifty feet downstream. Luckily he is unhurt, and you manage to meet him at the shore just as he pulls himself up.

“Yeah, that could have been bad…” Evan takes off his shirt and begins to wring it out.

Your eyes ghost over Evan’s lean muscled frame. //Fuck, I don’t want to be separated with Evan for too long...//

You have a look around. When you turn back to Evan, [[he isn’t wearing any clothes.]]

“What the hell are you doing?!” you shriek at him.

“A few mosquito bites on my ass are worth it if I can dry off.”

“Why are you naked!?”

Evan raises an eyebrow and shrugs. “How else am I supposed to dry off?”

“Tch. And why do you have a boner?”

“Oh, that’s easy! It’s because you’re fucking sexy.”

“I am going to go find Drew while you dry off…”

&quot;Taylor, wait!&quot;

“//What!?// you snap.

“How about a little quickie first? [[We can find Drew afterwards.]]”

“Awwww! Don’t be mean, Taylor! How about a handy?”

“I am out of here.”

“Wait! Taylor!” 

You turn to yell at Evan but misjudge the distance and find Evan right behind you.

Evan nearly tackles you to the ground but you both remain upright, held in an awkward embrace.

“Haah… Hwaah…” A heavy breathing Evan holds your head against his chest. You can feel his hot breath on the top of your head. “Given how much you enjoyed the dildo I got you, I am sure you will really appreciate the //real thing//,” Evan whispers in your ear.

“Evan! What has gotten into you?”

“Nothing. I am just tired of looking at your ass. You have no idea how painful it is to have the hottest babe in the world just a few feet away.” 

&quot;But we&#39;re friends!&quot;

“Exactly. Let’s be friends that fuck!” Evan says as he pushes you down over a suspended log.

“EVVAN!!”

“Come on, it will be amazing!”

“//IT!?//”

“Oh come on, after last night I know you are just as horny as I am. Look at me.” Evan gestures at his swollen groin.

“I am trying not to!” 

“We don’t have to tell Drew. Let’s just get this out of our systems.”

[[“Evan, I am not having sex with you!”]]

The reminder of the events in the tent make you queasy.

Evan’s strong, broad hands press into the small of your back, arching your butt up towards him. With one hand he pulls down your pants and exposes your bare pussy. Your best friend latches on to your hips and pulls your privates towards his own.

You feel Evan’s dick poke into the soft flesh of your thighs.

“Nooooo! Evan! Stop!!”

“I am sorry, Taylor, but I need to do this… For both our sakes… I am going to put it inside.”

“Don’t you fuckin’ dare--!” //Noooo this can&#39;t be happening!//

You twist away from Evan, pulling your pants up just in time to witness Drew’s glorious arrival.

//WAAACRASHSMASHBASH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHG GRCKCKKKKKKKKK!//

Drew tumbles down the mountainside like an avalanche, bringing down half the mountain with him.

He lands in the middle of a pile of debris, appearing almost miraculously unharmed.

“DREW!”

Drew wipes the sweat and dirt from his eyes. He blinks rapidly at Evan’s state of undress. “Why are you naked?”

Evan shrugs. “My clothes got wet. Taylor was helping to dry them. You just couldn’t stay put for a few more minutes, hey?”

“You guys were gone for a long time.”

Evan grumbles as he puts on his wet clothes. The trio resumes hiking north as a group.

A short distance from the river, you find a highway.

The group’s mood immediately picks up.

“Ahhhh yes! Thank fuck!” Evan mimes kissing the pavement.

A car appears in the distance and your hopes soar. You jump up and down excitedly, waving your arms and wagging your thumb.

The car passes by without slowing. The driver doesn’t even look directly at you.

Evan seems frustrated. “Damn… How are we going to get picked up? There are three of us! Wait! Here comes another one!”

[[Take the initiative|flash the car]]

//I guess boobs are more effective hitch hiking tools than thumbs… I guess I will file that piece of info in the mental filing cabinet labelled “obvious.”//

“Taylor, you are awesome! Way to think on your feet!” Evan compliments you as he rushes up to the car.

You manage to get a ride all the way back to your vehicle.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/hikingdinner.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The three of you rush into the nearest restaurant  near the tourist attractions and rack up an insane bill… but it is totally worth it.

“Well, we made it out alive!” you declare victory.

“It should be good training for the end of the month,” Evan replies.

“What’s happening at the end of the month?--ohhh, //the cabin!//” You answer your own question.

It has been a tradition for the past few years for you, Drew, and Evan to visit Evan’s cabin in the fall. Given the drunken shenanigans that usually take place, you don’t think attending this year is a smart idea.

//After this trip I don’t think I want to be out in the woods anytime soon...//

You blink rapidly, conscious of your long eyelashes and &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Lucas&quot; &quot;Lucas desc&quot;&gt;&gt;’ amusement.

“What... the... //fuck// have you done to me!?” you shriek.

“I have made you into the woman you are meant to be,” Lucas answers with a yawn.

You hold out a hand replete with long purple nails and cringe. //At least I can use these to claw Lucas to death!// “You made me look like a huge slut!” you screech.

Lucas shrugs but then nods thoughtfully.

“Why would you do this to me!? You perverted bastard!”

“I assure you I am well bred.” Lucas gives you a wry smile. “And soon you shall be too, I think. You look like you are //made to breed//,” he adds with a chuckle.

Insulting Lucas is the only petty power you possess. “You’re such a piece of garb-ahh…” Your vocal chords suddenly cease functioning mid sentence.

“As much as I enjoyed playing with you, your constant whining has gotten on my nerves. You are meant to be seen and not heard. Taylor, you worry too much about the wrong things!” Lucas chides you. “A good slut like you should worry about trivial goods like makeup and shoes while pursuing your carnal desires to their logical conclusions.”

“What a crock of shit! I… Uhhh...” //I don’t feel so hot… although I am super hot! Err… What the heck is wrong with me?//

After a moment of dizziness, you blink your eyes and Lucas is sitting in a different place and position. Your jaw is suddenly sore. You have a sour gloss coating your lips. //Did I lose time…?// you wonder. Your mind feels numb.

“Don’t look so distressed! You’re doing great, Taylor! Embrace your new identity!” Lucas encourages you.

You glare back at the executive but find your eyes slide off of his greasy smirk. Fixated momentarily upon Lucas’ unnaturally fit body, you finally tear yourself away. You fan your face with your hand as you become increasingly aware of how potent your sexual desire is in your new, altered form.

//Lucas has definitely messed with my mind as much as my body!//

“Come here, kitten.” Lucas beckons you forth. You hate yourself when you acknowledge Lucas’ call. 

Even stalling a moment makes your skin crawl. With a snap of Lucas’ fingers you feel jolted into action.Your inhibitions fall away, replaced with an innate yearning to do horribly lewd things.

Slipping in and out of awareness in a daze, you glide through your day like some kind of waking dream. You spend a third of your shift in front of the mirror, a third at your desk, and a third under Mr. Ferret’s.

“Gllarghb… Aghh… Gahh…” you slobber away, deepthroating the Executive’s cock until he graciously unloads down your throat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbounloaded.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;You swallow like a good bimbo slut and lick your lips clean. 

Your eagerness pleases Lucas and he rewards you with another round of face fucking, giving you a fresh dose of manly cream for your efforts.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbobjslow.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Disturbingly, an unnatural pride and well earned shame compete for supremacy within you.

“Taylor, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.”

//Not likely,// you try and reply. Instead you only muster a moan. [[“Mhmm...”]]

To your utter horror, you are //disappointed// when Lucas dismisses you without taking actions any further. He gives you a room number and tells you to be outside his office at seven the next morning. With another snap of his fingers, your dormant subconscious reemerges.

//What has happened to me?// you wonder as you step into the hall with Lucas’ seed still staining your lips. 

With a sense of prevailing doom, you walk woodenly to your new room. Each step makes your body sway and your more-than-ample bosom bounce.

Once inside your suite, [[you lock the door and sink to the floor with your head in your hands.]]

Your new voice sounds high, pitchy, and so annoying you loath hearing it. “This is //so// fucked!”

You stand awkwardly, feeling a bit unbalanced by your generous proportions. As you look down at your jiggling breasts, your rage bubbles to the surface.

“These damn inflated things are...  //ridiculous!//” //And likely to draw every Tom, Dick, and Harry within a hundred miles...//

You stare down at your enlarged breasts with escalating curiosity. You are groping yourself before you even fully comprehend what you are doing.

“Yiiia!” you cry out as you tweak your nipple to feed some strange compulsion within you. Your hot, aching body telegraphs its longing to be touched with every moan and shudder.

As you continue to fondle yourself, you give way to your desires, fading into a delirious state of ecstasy. You had always desired to play with huge breasts. How they came into your possession now seems of substantially less importance than fulfilling your overwhelming urge to enjoy their divinely soft presence to the most of your abilities.

“These boobies are all mine! Mwahahaha!”

Just as you are about to go overboard, your eye catches the glow of a digital clock.

“It’s //three// in the morning?! What the fuck, did I stumble into a time vortex too!?” 

The realization of the late hour sends your body into sudden onset sleep mode.

Your lust is smothered by worries and fatigue. While yawning continuously, you find the bedroom and pass out without even climbing under the blankets.

At six thirty, an alarm you don’t remember setting begins to loudly chime away next to your ear.

The bizarre statement is apparently a request. Your stomach does somersaults as you try and think of a way out of your trap. The act of thinking makes your head ache.

“Why did you come here, Taylor?” Lucas asks you.

Snapping back to reality, you consider Lucas’ words. You find it impossible to lie. “I-I don’t know.” //Why the hell did I show up here?// You shake your head and the action seems to jar loose an obvious piece of information that was hidden in plain sight. “//Because you did this to me!//” you shout at Lucas.

“Yes I did. And you can thank me by getting me my morning coffee and a blowjob.”

“No way. I…” Your mental gears grind to a halt. You are paralyzed until Lucas grabs your hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. At first you are threatened but those feelings change as your realize that Lucas is attempting to //comfort// you. 

“Hush, it’s alright. You don’t have to think anymore. Just be happy, Taylor,” he softly whispers assurances that your mind struggles to make sense of. “You’re such a striking young woman that you have caused me some discomfort.” Lucas gestures at his tented pants. “If you relieve me, I will be sure to return the favor later.”

“I…” You fade into silence as your eyes are inexorably drawn to Lucas’ groin.

You bob up and down on Lucas’ erection, sinking deeper into an erotic trance with each passing moment.

“Mmm…”

It’s all Lucas’ fault that you feel this way.

In a quest to make both yourself and Lucas orgasm, you begin to suck deeper. You cover him with with saliva until his hot cock slides easily between your digits.

“Ah, yeaaassss!”

Urged on by Lucas’ groans, you watch Lucas’ legs buck and spasm while you stick the tip of your tongue as far into his cock hole as possible.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimboworkingthetip.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Aeeeeeeeeii… Ah! Yes! Worship my dick! Ahhhhh…” the executive groans. Apparently you’ve hit the older man’s pleasure bullseye.

You feel your disgust return when you realize that you are //smiling// [[during this revolting act.]]

“...You to cum!”

Lucas bursts out laughing. “You want me to cum? Haha! I love the change of heart you are having! I could never ignore such a request! Now take my dick, you big bimbo slut!”

Without another word Lucas rams his cock to the back of your throat. He violently face fucks you until your tear filled vision dims and you fear you will pass out.

“That’s enough! Open up!”

Caught up in the moment, you open your mouth and stick out your pink tongue.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbocuminmouth.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Lucas jerks off in front of you, shooting several spurts of cum onto your waiting tongue. 

After he finishes, you close your mouth and swallow without thinking.

“That’s a good girl…” Lucas pants. [[“Now get me my coffee.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2332" name="“Now get me my coffee.”" tags="" position="10225,16250" size="100,100">
With a bad taste in your mouth, you struggle to your feet. Without any prior exploration you quickly discover the breakroom and prepare a cup of coffee.

You return and set down the coffee, replete with a tiny saucer of milk, cream, sugar, and artificial sweetener.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/coffee.JPG&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I’m sorry, I didn’t ask how you take your coffee… so I brought a bit of everything.”

Lucas chuckles. “Well that’s really putting your mind to good use. For the future, I take my coffee black with a single sugar. I think you’ll do well here, Taylor.”

“I am eager to please.” //Err...//

“Yes, you’re perfect.”

//I’m perfect? But… This isn’t really me… is it?// Your memories have become twisted. You don’t understand what is happening around you anymore.

The only thing you want is to stay close to Lucas.

[[Tears of disappointment well in your eyes when he gives you a new job.]]

“That’s part of it. Director Harriat is waiting for you. Treat him just like you would me.” 

//I knew it!//

Lucas jots a room number on a sticky pad and hands it to you. He turns to face his computer which serves as your dismissal.

Once back in the hall you feel much more clear headed.

You have a suspicion that trying to fight against Lucas’ programming will be incredibly painful.

You hold up the note, as you weigh a life of assured pleasure vs one with a hard road and unknown outcome.

As you argue with yourself you begin to sweat. Every second of inaction feels like it is driving needles deeper into your brain.

“Ughh… I just have… to… Hwaah… Hahh...”

Your vision starts to swim while your chest tightens.

As you gasp for breath, you decide to...

[[Follow Lucas&#39; instructions for now]]
[[Resist the programming!]]x

It looks like you are stuck as a Trans Corp puppet for the time being.

As soon as you start moving again, your painful symptoms vanish.

You pass several people in the halls. Several of them stare at you. A few snicker at you behind your back. 

The room on the note is easy to find. After a short walk, you locate your destination.

You knock and a gruff voice commands you to enter.

Inside is an olive skinned man in a suit. “I am Mr. Harriat,” the dark haired man introduces himself.

“Hi. I’m Taylor. I guess I am part of the cleaning crew.&quot;

“My private washroom is in need of some cleaning,” the director informs you.

//Geez, doesn’t this huge company have cleaning staff?// You notice that Harriat is looking at you like a starving dog would eye a steak grilling on a BBQ. Worse than your awkward circumstances, is the realization that a growing part of you enjoys the attention.

//I like being looked at…? No, I&#39;m not that vain!// 

“Hehe. [[I think you want more than a clean bathroom]],” you guess.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2335" name="Resist the programming!" tags="" position="10350,16375" size="100,100">The pain urges you to give in but you find it inconsequential given the ultimate stakes.

//A life like this is no life at all!//

You decide you’d rather die than be Lucas’ slave.

You scream like an unhinged banshee as your mind feels like it is ripped apart.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2336" name="I think you want more than a clean bathroom" tags="" position="10100,16475" size="100,100">Harriat grins. “Lucas always has the best girls. I heard he had a new one that was a total fox. I am glad he owes me a big favor. You’re exactly my type. Lucas, that generous soul, is allowing me to break you in.”

Harriat rises from his seat, revealing that he is an exceptionally tall and well built man. He corrals you in the washroom and locks the door behind him.

The slutty programing battles against your subconscious.

You try to ignore Harriat but find that difficult. Luckily, you discover a pail of sponges and cleaning products.

//Maybe I can distract him...//

Although it seems like wishful thinking, you fill the pail with hot water and soap.

Harriat watches you begin to clean his bathroom.

At first there is a striking difference is perceived power. Dressed in a suit and looking down at you from his considerable height, you feel small and insignificant with a scrub brush held in hand.

Yet the fact that such a powerful man desires you, seems to balance the equation a bit.

//I’m so sexy I can&#39;t really blame this creep for staring...//

You feel an urge to show off. New instincts and old warnings collide but your naughty impulses win out.

[[Give the executive a show]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2337" name="Give the executive a show" tags="" position="10225,16500" size="100,100">With sudsy water and big breasts in sight, you decide that combining the two elements would be fun.

//I wonder if this guy likes wet T-shirts? Heh, everybody likes wet T-shirts!//

You put on a sexy show, dribbling hot water down your top.

“Ooops… I am sorry, sir. Sometimes I am a little bit //clumsy…//”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bimbowash.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Harriat clearly approves of your actions. His face reddens and his breathing deepens as he watches you do a very shitty job of cleaning his glass. 

You begin to rub your body, your hands gliding up and down your ample curves.

“H-h-holy… I want - I //need to// see your tits.”

[[You smirk back at the man, pleased with his honesty.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2338" name="You smirk back at the man, pleased with his honesty." tags="" position="10100,16600" size="100,100">//I think he deserves a little reward...//

You pull your white shirt over your head, revealing your bountiful breasts and their purple covering.

Harriat’s eyes flick down, a subtle yet powerful command demanding that you continue. Sadly, you barely get to tease him. You give Harriat exactly what he wants. With a soft //click// you let your bra fall to the ground, baring your huge DD breasts for the older man’s viewing pleasure.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bimbowash2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

While Harriat gawks at you, you continue your show.

You splatter sudsy water down your breasts and toned stomach.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbowash.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
While rubbing your breasts with a sponge you moan loudly to show how much the act turns you on.

The way the man watches you makes you certain you command his full attention.

Revelling in your sexual power, [[you pull down your shorts in front of your eager onlooker.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2339" name="you pull down your shorts in front of your eager onlooker." tags="" position="10225,16625" size="100,100">For a few seconds you stare into the lights and feel the control on your mind weaken.

//What’s going on!? Oh, fuck… Why am I taking my clothes off for this fucking creep?// you ask yourself. //&lt;span class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;Because taking off your clothes is fuuuun~! Duh.&lt;/span&gt;// a second feminine voice answers.

“Unn…” You rub your temples.

“You want to see it?” the director asks you.

“Of course, Mr. Harriat!” you answer a bit too quickly.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bimbowash3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The executive whips out his erect cock. “What do you think?” he asks you while his massive member fills your vision.

//Oh-my-god...// Your mouth begins to water. “Um, it’s very large…” you admit.

//&lt;span class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;What a big, yummy cock!&lt;/span&gt;// the voice inside you approves.

You shake your head to dispel your mental fog but instead of dissipating, it only grows thicker, coiling around the pleasure centers of your brain. You feel yourself fall deeper under Trans Corp’s spell.

“And it&#39;s hard,” Harriat adds. “You will help me out with that, right?”

You gulp and nod, suddenly [[more excited than apprehensive of what is to come.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2340" name="more excited than apprehensive of what is to come." tags="" position="10100,16725" size="100,100">Harriat hooks a hand around your ass and pulls you close. Before you can object, he plants his lips upon your own and forces his tongue into your mouth.

“Mwwaafahhh!” //Fucking shit!// Your head spins. In your twisted mind, kissing feels more damaging to your psyche than overt sexual acts. //Kissing is just too intimate… ahh...//

While you fight against Harriat’s kisses, he grabs your hand and moves it to his groin.

Your fingers coil around the Trans Corp executive hard, meaty cock. You give him a blind handjob.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbowashhj.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As your tongues duel, you continue madly stroking Harriat, while your other hand is drawn to the wet center of your panties.

“Your hand feels great but…” Harriat whispers in you ear.

The executive’s heavy hands push you downward and you drop to your knees before him wearing nothing except your damp underwear.

“Make me feel good,” he orders.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bimbowash4.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You wrap a hand around Harriat’s dick and softly jerk the base of his humongous member. In your new bimbofied form, you find yourself having strange thoughts. You catch yourself //admiring// the executive’s cock. 

After a few gentle strokes, a bead of precum appears on the head of the man’s penis. At this proximity, with a hard, straight cock pointed down your throat, you have an overwhelming desire to find out what this penis feels like in your mouth.

“Hwaahh…”

“Stop teasing me,” [[Harriat admonishes you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2341" name="Harriat admonishes you." tags="" position="10225,16750" size="100,100">“Sowwy… Ommm…”

“Ahh, that’s excellent. Your mouth feels amazing,” Harriat compliments you.

//I bet it does…// You desperately wish that your circumstances were reversed. There was a time you would have loved a blowjob from a beautiful woman that looks like you do now.

//Fuck, I can’t think about that now! Relating to this pervert isn’t going to help me...// “Bleghh… Hwah… Ommm… Gah…” you utter lewd noises as you service the executive.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/bimbowash5.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Look me in the eye while you suck me.”

“Yes, sir…”

You smother the dick in front of you with kisses. After what feels like hours, your partner shifts to a more comfortable spot and you take the opportunity to do the same.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbowashsuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After getting accustomed to your new position, you lower your lips over Harriat’s glans. While playfully kissing his manhood, you lap up the old man’s precum. You find the salty, bitter tang is more intoxicating than disgusting. You fall into a steady rhythm, bobbing up and down on the dick of a man you only just met.

You push your blonde hair away to more fully concentrate on the task at hand.

“Ahhh, I can’t cum yet! Stop!”

Harriat scoops you up like a weightless doll and sets you on the bathroom vanity. [[He pulls your panties off and gives them a sniff before tossing them away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2342" name="He pulls your panties off and gives them a sniff before tossing them away." tags="" position="10100,16850" size="100,100">
//Oh no...// Your hopes of getting through this without intercourse have just died.

The old man lines up his manhood with your little love hole. Naked and horny with legs splayed, there is nothing you can do but accept Harriat inside you.

With obvious delight, Harriat savors the moment he plunges inside your vagina. His huge cock barely fits, stretching you to your limits, but he seems content to make it work.

You watch in amazement as the massive fleshy pillar disappears inside you. Your mind goes blank except for the sensation of penetration and sex.

The older man shows you no mercy. He plows your sodden cleft with reckless abandon. Your head bangs against the glass as he fucks you and you don’t care, fixated only on getting as much dick inside you as possible.

“Oh my god, oh my god, oh my…” 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimbowashfuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As the huge dick surges in and out of you, you feel your sense of self slip away until there is only the escalating pleasure of your sex.

That pleasure builds until it can no longer be contained. “Hnnnnghhh!” you cry out as you orgasm, shivering underneath Harriat as he continues his business.

The older man pounds your pussy like a man twenty years younger.

//I never imagined being fucked like this would feel so… so… great.// The admission unlocks your inhibitions. 

Harriat brings you to the brink and back again. You cum again, shame free.

“Yesss… Ahh, it feels so good…” you breathlessly admit.

Your partner picks up his pace, clearly entering into the finale of your fuck-session. “Hwah, hwah… huh, ahhh, here it comes! I am going to cum!” [[Harriat announces.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2343" name="Harriat announces." tags="" position="10225,16875" size="100,100">Harriat pulls out and thrusts his smelly bulging dick into your face.

You stick out your chin like a boxer as Harriat treats your face like a cumrag.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/blucasbathc.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
He splatters you with semen before rubbing his spent cock on your cheeks.

Reproductive fluid drips down your naked body. Stained and marked, you feel like a total slut. You find your new identity to be is surprisingly liberating.

“I am cancelling my afternoon appointments. Let’s go to my suite for a bit, shall we?” Harriat suggests.

“Yes, sir…” [[You follow behind Harriat like a good bimbo slut.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2344" name="You follow behind Harriat like a good bimbo slut." tags="" position="10100,16975" size="100,100">By the time you make it Harriat’s room, your pussy is practically drooling everywhere.

You are on your back for the next three hours. Your tits flop around while Harrait rails you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bimboinbed.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You take cock like the champion sex goddess you now are.

“Hnnnn…. Ahhh! Yeee-eesss!”

You grab your hair and the pillow, squeezing harder as your partner pistons in and out of you.

Your made-for-sex body responds in kind, attempting to clamp down on the Harriat’s thundering penis.

“I am cumming!” your partner announces.

“Me too!”

“Unnnghhh….”

Your sweaty, tangled bodies fall back to the bedsheets.

Your hedonistic impulses refuse to be satisfied. The more sex you have, the more you crave.

//What if he recognized me?!//

“Wait, that isn’t likely, is it? I don’t really look like my old self… Ugh! What an asshole!” you fume. Your dad’s presence in a brothel seems to provide undeniable proof of his infidelity and wandering eye. “How long has he been going to brothels? Eww… I don’t even want to know! Fuck, dad! Way to make a super weird and messed up moment of my life even worse!”

“Are you in town?” you text your dad.

“Not for a few days,” he lies in his reply. “Need anything?”

“No, just been busy with school and wondering how you’ve been.”

“I’m great. Just enjoying some peace and quiet away from your mom :P” your dad replies.

“Hmm… maybe it wasn’t even him? No, what am I saying? It was //definitely// him. I know my own father… I just didn’t realize he was such a skeevy perv!”

You resolve to ignore your father’s perversions. You sit down and watch TV in an effort to distract yourself.

The next day, your classes pass by so slowly it feels like Father Time’s hourglass is filled with cold molasses.

[[“Your shift starts at four today, FYI,”]] Rhea messages you.

You arrive at the brothel and meet up with Rhea in the back room.

Rhea greets you with a big hug. Your breasts squish painfully together as your friend tightly squeezes you.

“Heeey, Taylor! I am glad we didn’t scare you off. I got something for you!” Rhea tosses you a small package.

Confused, you examine the small blue tablets.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/birthcontrol.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Cold meds?” you guess.

“Birth control pills,” Rhea corrects you with a grin.

“//Birth control!?//”

“That’s right. You should start taking them ASAP since they take a while to kick in. A pill a day keeps the parasites away,” Rhea rhymes. “We don’t want any little mistakes crawling around nine months from now, do we?”

“That is disgusting!”

“I know, right? Kids are gross.”

“I meant getting pregnant in the first place…” you clarify. “Besides, kids are more annoying than gross.”

Rhea shrugs. “If you say so, hun. But sex is fun. Cocks are pretty great too. Hey, where are you going?”

“Away from your corrupting influence. I am going to the lounge. We get free drinks on shift, right?”

Rhea nods. “Just be careful, lots of the clients start to look pretty good after a couple margaritas.”

“Noted.”

[[With Rhea’s laughter ringing behind you, you head for the lobby.]]

“This place is pretty classy. And not a single big screen TV in sight. I guess they don&#39;t need them...”

//Heh, I can almost relax and pretend this place isn&#39;t a brothel...//

&quot;Man, my life is full of twists and turns. I never thought I&#39;d be inside a brothel, let alone fricking work in one…&quot; you reflect. 

Amazingly, you finish your beer without any weirdos approaching you. To relieve a full bladder, you head to the lady&#39;s room.

&quot;I definitely need another drink,&quot; you remark as you return from the restroom. You stop dead in your tracks when you turn the corner back into the lounge and spot someone you definitely do not want to see. &quot;Oh-my-fucking-god.&quot; //There he is again! Seriously! What the fuck!?//

Your eyes ghost over the older man&#39;s rugged features. His prominent nose, salt and pepper stubble, and laid back confident smile are //very// familiar.

Your father catches you staring at him and mistakes your interest.  He jerks up, grinning confidently as he swaggers up to you. &quot;Hello gorgeous!&quot; he greets you. &quot;I caught you peeking.

&quot;Sorry, I am not interested,&quot; you say to him before the big creep can even finish his pitch.

Teddy&#39;s boldness shocks you and angers you at the same time. //My dad is clearly a far bigger pervert than I could have imagined!// 

Teddy winces but doesn&#39;t back down. &quot;You work here, right?&quot;

&quot;Yep, but we make our own decisions.&quot;

Your dad doesn&#39;t take the hint. &quot;How about we get to know each other a little bit better?&quot; he suggests.

Your anxiety makes you terse. [[&quot;No, sorry. I have other plans!&quot;]]

&quot;I wish you could stay a bit longer,&quot; Teddy replies as you begin to distance yourself from him. “Wait! At least tell me your name!” he calls after you, his voice sad and full of longing. 

You can tell at a glance that your father is annoyed at your refusal.  //As if I would do anything lewd with my dad… Geez… AWKWARD! No wonder mom has been pissed off lately...//

Normally your father&#39;s presence would be comforting but now it is anything but. You try and mentally distance yourself from that trainwreck by returning to check on Rhea.

An hour later, Teddy confronts you with your manager in tow.

&quot;Taylor, I am afraid the monseurre has purchased your companionship for the evening.  He has also paid the //premium// rate, too,&quot; the Proprietor adds with a furrowed brow. &quot;It would be impolite to refuse him,&quot; he whispers.
 
//What!? So it&#39;s my choice but what they want is pretty clear. I am definitely not having sex with my dad! Oh! That&#39;s right, maybe I can  mess with him and take his cash! Hm… Although that might be just, it is probably like dancing around in a minefield...//

The two men are looking at you expectantly while Rhea mimes random expressions that are apparently meant to urge you to accept the proposal.

//Gee, thanks for the name, dad...// &quot;I guess…&quot;

&quot;I am Teddy. Nice to meet you!&quot;

//I wish I could say likewise...// 

You remain silent but Teddy seems content to skip the awkward introductions and proceed right to the even more awkward meat of the conversation. &quot;So… I&#39;m curious,&quot; he begins. &quot;Why did you refuse me earlier?  Don&#39;t you think I am good looking?&quot;

&quot;What? No! It isn&#39;t that…&quot;  //Dad, you vain fucker, I can&#39;t just explain that I am your son!//

Eventually you get so pissed off you decide to go on the offensive.

You use the conversation to probe for information. &quot;So things have been bad for you lately?&quot;

Teddy looks at you and smiles broadly. &quot;Yep. Pretty much right up until the moment I literally bumped into you.&quot;

&quot;Um… Hahaha...&quot; You chuckle at the absurdity of the moment. It would probably be even funnier if it wasn&#39;t happening to you.

&quot;Ah, finally some laughter! [[I knew you were warming up to me!]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2354" name="&quot;Are you having marital troubles?&quot;" tags="" position="3000,13850" size="100,100">Teddy exhales loudly as he rubs his ring finger. &quot;My wife and I are not in the best place in our relationship,&quot; he admits. &quot;She&#39;s been ignoring me while she&#39;s off pursuing her own dreams. She is doing everything she can to make //herself// happy to the point I think she has forgotten about her husband. I went to help her and show my support and she chased me away, the selfish cunt.&quot;

You find yourself spontaneously objecting in defence of your mother. &quot;Hey!&quot; 

&quot;But that is why I come to places like this to relax and unwind. I am so glad I met you, Taylor. It&#39;s nice to have a woman that is willing to listen, even if I do have to pay you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you have any other family?&quot;

Teddy deflates a bit further. &quot;Not that can help me with this kind of stuff… I am just //lonely// is all…&quot;

&quot;Aww…&quot;

&quot;Ah, finally some sympathy! [[I knew you were warming up to me!]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2355" name="I knew you were warming up to me!" tags="" position="2875,14025" size="100,100">Your dad wastes no time, capitalizing on the small amount of goodwill he has just earned. 

&quot;How about a hug?&quot;

The sudden request makes you nervous. &quot;A hug…?&quot;

&quot;It would make me feel better.&quot;

&quot;That makes one of us…&quot;

&quot;I paid a small fortune for our time together. I am not asking much. It would make me //so// happy!&quot;

Teddy&#39;s change in approach is surprisingly effective. You find it hard to argue with him.

Your dad now seems more pathetic than anything else. &quot;Fine. Come here.&quot;

Like a sad puppy Teddy runs to you before wrapping his arms around you and squeezing you tightly to his broad chest.

The hug lingers far too long to feel natural. The seconds tick by, each compounding your discomfort. Your father has hugged you countless times… but never like this. You become conscious there are lots of people looking at you and your father.

Head pressed to head, you can hear your father&#39;s heavy breathing.

&quot;Ohh… You smell so good. Thanks… I needed that…&quot; he says when he finally pulls away.

Flustered, you sit down and look at the floor.
 
[[Teddy takes advantage of your distracted state.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2356" name="Teddy takes advantage of your distracted state." tags="" position="3000,13975" size="100,100">He shifts his chair closer to your own before boldly running a hand down the outside of your thigh.  The sudden touch makes you squeak in surprise while Teddy grins over at you. For most of your life Teddy has made you feel safe. Yet, now, you have never been more terrified and uncomfortable.

Teddy&#39;s hand continues up your body before he reverses course, sending a tingling trail up your leg until his hand is left resting over your crotch. He doesn&#39;t touch you further but his actions disturb you nonetheless.

The next instant Teddy goes from zero to a hundred. &quot;I like having you in my arms but I&#39;d //love// to have your //legs// wrapped around me.&quot;

You&#39;re unable to hide your disgust. &quot;Grooooossss!&quot; you blurt out.

Teddy winces. &quot;Didn&#39;t they teach you how to talk to clients?&quot;

&quot;I am new here and not used to dealing with perverts,&quot; you explain.

Teddy winces again. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so hostile,&quot; he sighs. &quot;But I guess that&#39;s part of your allure. You&#39;re like a firebrand.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. And if you touch me again you might just get //burned,//&quot; you snap. //Why won&#39;t this guy take the fucking hint?//

&quot;Oooh, scary! Getting burned might just be totally worth it.&quot; 

You shake your head in disbelief.

&quot;We should go upstairs together,&quot; he persists.

&quot;No, we shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;I just can&#39;t, alright? You should be happy I am even sitting here with you.&quot;

&quot;Well, I am… but you&#39;re being a bit //cold.//&quot;

[[&quot;You deserve it.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2357" name="&quot;You deserve it.&quot;" tags="" position="3000,14100" size="100,100">Teddy frowns. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Cuz you… fucking ran into me, you asshole!&quot; you deflect.

&quot;Hmm….&quot; Teddy reads your face. &quot;That is a lie,&quot; he concludes.

The truth seems off limits but a story with elements of truth is more believable than one without. &quot;I...uh… okay, //fine//.  You make me very uncomfortable,&quot; you concede.

Teddy raises an eyebrow. &quot;So? That&#39;s not always a bad thing. You make me a bit uncomfortable too, you know?&quot;

You shake your head. &quot;You remind me of someone I know and I just can&#39;t have you as a client, okay? Why is that so hard for you to accept? There are loads of girls here. Pick one other than me.&quot;

&quot;Ohh…&quot; your dad nods, as if finally comprehending a nearly impossible scenario explaining how you could possibly resist his advances. He leans back in his seat. &quot;So who is it?&quot; he asks you, his tone serious. &quot;Who made you this way?&quot;

Maybe it is partly because Teddy is your father, but you have an urge to at least partially explain yourself.

//Or it might be easier to lie… but dad is like a human polygraph sometimes...//

[[&quot;It&#39;s my dad…&quot;]]

&quot;You do?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay… I know of the perfect cure. I will help you get over your fears,&quot; Teddy whispers assurances as his face moves towards your own.

There is nowhere to run to. Your panic escalates to critical levels as your lips make contact.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddykiss.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your world fades into whiteness as your father kisses you full on the lips. The act is so shocking you nearly die of weirdness overload.

&quot;Mmmmphhff!! What the fuck!? You //kissed// me!&quot; you hiss once you rip your mouth free.

&quot;Yeah, I did. You had a bad experience, so we will just make this a good one.&quot; 

&quot;That is the most insane thing I have ever heard.&quot;

&quot;Love makes men do crazy things,&quot; Teddy replies, misinterpreting your words.

&quot;//Love!?// Mwwaaahh!&quot;

He kisses you again and his lips trail down to your collar bone, dying your pale skin red along the way.  

A thousand protests echo within your mind but you are unable to act. 

&quot;See, that wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot;

//I don&#39;t know what the hell that was...// &quot;It was definitely bad…&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a good kisser,&quot; Teddy presses. 

&quot;No, I can&#39;t be… I haven&#39;t kissed many people.&quot;

[[&quot;Well you&#39;re a natural.&quot;]]

&quot;I think its time we finally went upstairs. Don&#39;t worry. You won&#39;t have to call me &quot;daddy&quot; unless you want to,&quot; he adds with a chuckle.

&quot;Oh my fucking god…&quot;

Teddy&#39;s brow furrows. &quot;You don&#39;t seem that happy. I thought young people loved earning their own money. I paid a lot of cash for your company.&quot;

//What the hell is he asking of me!?// &quot;Look, I am new… I mean I&#39;m not experienced with all this //adult stuff//. I haven&#39;t decided if this is even the right place for me.&quot;

&quot;Come upstairs with me,&quot; Teddy repeats.

//I guess I was naive to hope a hug was enough… I don&#39;t want to piss everyone off on what&#39;s basically my first day...// You decide on setting some clear boundaries. &quot;I am not going to let you do anything weird. No sex. And we keep our clothes on --//both// of us,&quot; you clarify as you lay down some rules.

&quot;I will be nothing but a perfect gentleman,&quot; you father assures you.

&quot;And no more kissing! Or groping!&quot; you add.

Teddy frowns. &quot;That is a lot of rules. What are we going to do then? Ahh, nevermind! I will think of something. If you come with me for a little while I will let you off the hook for the rest of the night, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;

&quot;Fine. Let&#39;s keep this above board.&quot;

You follow your father upstairs. On the way you spot Rhea, who promptly begins laughing her ass off.

You walk into the suite feeling like a lamb being led into a lion&#39;s den. [[Your dad bolts the door behind you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2361" name="Your dad bolts the door behind you." tags="" position="2875,14250" size="100,100">//Fuck… now what? I need to like, uh… friendzone my dad!//

&quot;Whoa, hold up. I just came up here with you to talk.&quot;

&quot;No you didn&#39;t,&quot; you father disagrees. &quot;I want some platinum service.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what that means.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in my room, Taylor. What are you going to do for me?&quot;

&quot;Nothing you seem to want.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s not a very good deal for me. Hmmm… let&#39;s see. No kissing, no groping, no sex, clothes on, and of course the all encompassing &quot;nothing weird&quot; rule,&quot; your dad recites the long list of your conditions.

&quot;That&#39;s right. Anything else, I guess I could do… unless it&#39;s weird.&quot;

&quot;I think you deserve a spanking.&quot;

You blink twice, unsure you heard correctly. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You heard me. I want to spank you. That doesn&#39;t violate any of your guidelines.&quot;

&quot;I said nothing weird! That&#39;s //definitely// weird!&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not. I&#39;ll just give your bottom a few smacks and you will be on your way with a bag of cash.&quot;

&quot;Is this a joke?&quot;

&quot;No, I am dead serious. You have been a bad girl and you need to be spanked if you want your allowance.&quot;

&quot;Um…&quot; Amazingly, your father seems to have discovered a loophole in your arrangement. //He&#39;ll be pissed unless I do //something// with him. He isn&#39;t just an elderly man I can bullshit with for a couple hours. Damnit, my life sucks!//

You seem to be in trouble no matter what you choose to do. The least terrible outcome appears to be merely to bend over.

[[Get spanked by your dad.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2362" name="Get spanked by your dad." tags="" position="3000,14350" size="100,100">&quot;Fine, spank me then you big pervert,&quot; you relent.

&quot;With pleasure! Show me your bum!&quot; Teddy shouts while moving his finger in a circular motion, evidently demanding that you turn around.

//Fuck my life...// 

You slip off your pants and present your pert behind for your father&#39;s inspection.

&quot;Wow, what a gorgeous tight little ass. It&#39;s perfection, Taylor!&quot;

//Apparently I have good genes...//

//Of all the people to show off to… Maybe it will help if I pretend he isn&#39;t my dad.//

Teddy makes that attempt impossible. &quot;Bad girl! Bad girl! //Daddy&#39;s gonna punish you!//&quot;

&quot;No! Ah. Ow. Ahch! //Ow!// Ow. Fuck!&quot;

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/taybuttspank.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&quot;Aeeiaaaaaaah!&quot; //This is sooo humiliating! I am grown-ass man having his ass spanked by his dad!// &quot;Ahhhhh! Ah! //Ah!//

&quot;That&#39;s right, louder! I want to hear your sexy cries!&quot;

&quot;Ahhhhhh! Owww!&quot; //Dad, you fucking pervert!//

His alternating strikes shift position until your entire backside is red.

After a dozen more swats, your dad&#39;s hand lingers and his fingers invade the gap between your thighs.

Your father lightly brushes the center of your panties.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re getting pretty wet down here,&quot; he observes.

&quot;It&#39;s just sweat!&quot;

[[&quot;What did I say about lying?&quot;]] your father chides you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2363" name="&quot;What did I say about lying?&quot;" tags="" position="2875,14375" size="100,100">Your dad bends you over his knee, throwing you forward onto the bed.

&quot;Wait! Stop it!&quot;

A hard slap makes your back arch from the sudden force.

&quot;Ah!&quot;

&quot;This will teach you to be honest!&quot;

//Whap! Whap! Whap-whap!// Your father releases a barrage of butt stinging slaps.

&quot;Ahhhhh! Why are you--&quot; //Whap-whap!// &quot;-doing this to me!?&quot; //Whap-whap!//

&quot;I already explained that. Don&#39;t worry! I am not hurting you!&quot;

&quot;What do you mean!? It hurts! Fucking stop it!&quot;

The pain is insignificant compared to your humiliation. 

Your dad gives you one last hard smack of your bottom for good measure.

Seizing the opportunity, you roll off the bed and scramble to your feet. &quot;I&#39;m done!&quot;

Teddy smiles at you. &quot;Heh. It was worth it. Hard to be a stuck-up bitch with a stinging red ass, eh?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you just said that. You&#39;re unbelievable!&quot; you shout as you storm off, [[retreating to the dressing rooms.]]

&quot;Having fun making out with that hot older guy?&quot; she teases you. “Did you two do it together?”

&quot;No! //Fuck no!// Guhhhh...&quot;  

&quot;Sheesh, what&#39;s got your panties in a bunch?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just, that guy… I don&#39;t like him.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you //don&#39;t// like him. I always make out with all the guys I don&#39;t like. I stick my tongue right down their throats lalalala!&quot;

“Rhea! Please stop!”

“Sorry~! By the way, the boss wants to see you,” Rhea informs you.

“About what? I went on that shitty date! I even got...”

“You got what?”

“I got //spanked,// alright!?”

“Is that why you are sitting so awkwardly?” Rhea asks you when her laughter subsides.

“Yes.” You feel a change of subject is in order. “[[Do you know why he wants to see me?]]”

“Lighten up, Taylor! I think you are going to reach your funding goals pretty quickly - if you’re open minded.”

“Rhea, you’re kind of freaking me out...”

“Don’t be scared. //Open minded,//” Rhea repeats her advice as she pushes you out the door.

You make the short walk to the building’s rear offices.

After knocking timidly and receiving a call to enter, you step inside the largest office in the building.

//If this is about Teddy again… I swear to god I will kick his ass when I change back!//

“Rhea said you wanted to see me…”

“Of course! Have a seat, my dear!”

You sit down in front of your boss, [[the dreaded underworld figure known only as the Proprietor.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2366" name="the dreaded underworld figure known only as the Proprietor." tags="" position="3000,14600" size="100,100">You’ve never heard anyone call him anything else. Even from your brief employment, you have heard only praise from both clientele and his employees. The owner of the Platinum Palace is hardly the jumped up pimp you expected when Rhea initially led you here. The Proprietor, a placid, old, bald, reed thin and bespectacled man, is the opposite of what you had originally thought to encounter. 

Your bosses’ professionalism was part of the reason you stuck around.

The Proprietor leans forward as he inspects you, his spectacles gleaming brightly, giving him the illusion of monstrously large eyes. You feel like a mouse standing before a curious owl. 

“So, Taylor how have you been finding things?” 

“It’s been an experience,” you answer diplomatically.

“An enjoyable one?” he presses.

“Yeah… It’s been fun.” //And the money is great!//

You make small talk for a few minutes until the conversation takes a dramatic left turn.

“Are you a virgin?” the older man asks you almost casually.

After a few startled blinks, you quickly gather your composure. //I guess that is a routine question in this business...// “Well, Rhea and I have played around a bit…” you admit. “And I did some shows for a few people since I started here…”

“But you have never truly had a man?” the Proprietor presses.

“Had a man…? You mean like- Ew! Uh, no!”

Your boss frowns. “Oh? Are you absolutely against the idea?”

I want to make good money but I am not going to sell my fucking soul… but if this whole sexy-girl-body thing is temporary wouldn’t it be a be a bit odd not to give this body a test drive?//

Your boss waits for you to answer.

You sigh. “Am I against it? I honestly don’t know. I am not a prude or anything… I don’t like guys but I guess that didn’t stop me from coming here in the first place,” you think aloud.

“True.” The proprietor smiles, content to let you talk yourself into being a whore.

“And I guess I don’t have to like guys to put up with them… but…&quot;  //I don’t want to do this stuff... But then why do I keep coming back here!? Fuck!// “Most of the girls here make a lot of money…”

“They certainly are well compensated. I hope you can be among them one day. If you stay with us for a few years I am sure you will become very popular with our clientele. I will make you a multimillionaire before you turn thirty. You don’t even need to go to school. Just let me take care of everything!”

“But that means having sex.”

“Having sex is just a natural part of being a grown up. You’re a stunning young woman and this is a very lucrative and fun path that is open only to a very select few.”

The Proprietor leans back and flashes you a grin. “Ah, Taylor! You’re as astute as you are beautiful! The virginity of a stunning young woman like yourself is worth a significant sum. It is smart for a woman blessed with fertility to get maximum value from what is usually an inconsequential and brief event.”

“What exactly are you suggesting here?”

“This is a house that sells pleasure and sympathetic company. I merely suggest you do just that.”

“Sell… myself?” //Er… more than I already have…?//

“That’s correct. Your, ahem, //rose// is worth a small fortune. One night may very well put you through a semester at school or provide enough for a nice car. It is up to you, and the level of attraction you are able to convey to potential clients.”

You bite your lip as your mind tallies up a significant sum of money. //I can’t believe I am even considering this! What I’ve done already is bad enough! Even just thinking about going all the way just seems to cross the line!//

“How much money are we talking here?”

“That depends on a few different factors and some of your choices. Usually the girls get about five to ten thousand dollars for two hours.”

“Wow, that’s more than a major CEO makes per hour… Gah!” You realize that by even considering this transaction you have made the tacit mental admission that your body is for sale.

//But this isn’t really my body! I just have to use this to get my real one back!//

“Yes it is. I am confident I can get you even more,” boasts your boss.

You feel rich already. “Really? How much more?”

“Perhaps double or triple.”

//Meaning I could make a good chunk of what I need in a single night?! Oh man… I guess everyone does have their price.//

“Meaning some old, gross, fat guy could buy me and I’d have to go along with it?”

“We want our women to be attractive and the men to be rich,” the Proprietor patiently explains. &quot;If you want a hot guy instead of cash, you should try and find someone on your own. There are many men here who would kill to be the first inside you. I’d even put myself in the running if I was ten years younger.”

//Double ew. Sex? Inside me… A penis…? What the fuck am I even thinking of!?//

“I need to think about this,” you tell the Proprietor.

You go home and think. Your long hair and strange body constantly remind you of your newfound femininity.

The decision to sell yourself unleashes a paradoxical feeling: an awakening of empowerment balanced with the logical temperament that what you are doing is completely contradictory.

“Why me?” you repeat the question you can’t seem to shake.

“You were honest with me last night, so I will be too. The truth is… you kind of remind me of my daughter,” he suddenly admits. Teddy leans in close to you. “You’re much prettier than she is though!” he adds.

Your heart bounces around in your chest. You turn your head and cough in an effort to buy yourself a few seconds to think.  //What is he saying!? He’s talking about Julie? Meaning he picked me because of some weird fetish involving incest?… EWW!! Seriously, dad, what the hell!? I thought this couldn’t be any weirder and now it is fucking worse. Thanks. A. Lot!//

“Does that make me a dirty old man?” Teddy asks you.

//YES! Yes, on so many levels! … Holy fuck, dad...//

You try and show none of your discomfort. There is no way you are successful.

Teddy senses your unease. He backs off for a moment and drains his cup.

“I just want someone to talk to and comfort me,” your dad sorrowfully explains.

//Geez, if you were that lonely you could have just called… Ahh, what am I thinking? He is clearly exaggerating for extra points. It is obvious my dad didn’t come to a fucking brothel for the conversation or decor!//

“Why are you so shy?” he asks you.

“Um… I’m not. You’re just very creepy.”

“I know you don’t really feel that way. You’re still talking to me afterall.”

“Hmmph.”

“How about this: I have an offer for you.”

“What kind of offer?”

“I will give you five hundred dollars if you let me give you a massage. That’s a great deal. You should be paying //me,// not the other way around.”

“You just want to touch me…”

“Guilty.”

It seems like easy money but one look at the disturbing glint in your father’s eye makes you deeply uncomfortable. 

“I don’t know… You’re sure you want me?”

“I am sure because I haven’t been able to get you out of my mind since we bumped into each other. If that isn’t fate to stumble into the most beautiful woman in the world, then I don’t know what is.”

[[Let him give you a massage]]

“Yep.”

“And you will be on good behavior?”

“I am just a humble masseuse,” Teddy reassures you. 

“Remember: nothing weird.”

“On my honor. You are welcome to have a shower first. If you want.”

You follow Teddy back to his suite. Since you’ve been sweating profusely since coming into contact with Teddy, you head into the bathroom.

Just as you begin to shower, you hear the door open.

//Kacha!// //What the hell!?//

“Some cackling crazy girl ran in here and stole your clothes… I swear. I didn’t have anything to do with it. I&#39;m sorry,” Teddy apologizes when you stick your head outside the door.

//Rhea!//

Teddy shrugs. “Oh well. Let’s continue. Massage time!”

“But my clothes!” you protest.

“Underwear just gets in the way of a proper massage.”

“Err…”

“The massage table is set up and waiting.”

With only a thin towel protecting you from Teddy’s gaze, you feel woefully unequipped to deal with the situation.

It seems your options are to stay with Teddy or make an embarrassingly public retreat wearing only a towel.

//Damn you, Rhea! And Damn you too, Teddy!//

“That is really unfortunate. Hopefully I will be able to see you another time.”

“Perhaps.”

As you head back to the employee area you pass a group of loud young men shouting in the hallway.

One of the shouting men is particularly abrasive… and recognizable.

“No way! Is that fucking &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Mitch&quot; &quot;Mitch desc&quot;&gt;&gt;!? This place is truly a magnet for creeps! I have to get the fuck out of here.&quot;

You retreat back into the lounge and take the long way back to the dressing rooms.

//I really hope he didn’t see me...//

If he does anything weird, I’m calling security!//

Teddy starts by rubbing a splash of oil on his hands which he then transfers to your body. His oily fingers leave a tingling sensation in their wake as he covers your body.

Compared to being spanked, your experience is the polar opposite.  //I can’t believe how good this feels… His hands are amazing! Where did he learn to do this? Ew, nevermind, I don&#39;t wanna know!//

Your dad’s hands roam around your body massaging the tension from every muscle until you feel loose and relaxed.

//Whoa, I could almost fall asleep...// Your eyes snap open. //I definitely can’t do that right now!//

Teddy finds a tender spot in your lower back. His touch becomes almost delicate as he explores your body with clear reverence. 

“This might hurt a little bit but it is the only way to work out the knot.”

“Uh… Kch! Ah…” you grunt as your father presses the ball of his thumb deep into your flesh.

Your father manages to break down the stubborn muscle with just the right amount of pressure and manipulation.

When he withdraws his hand, you feel a wave of relief surge through your body. [[It is like you&#39;ve been in pain your entire life and you never even realized it.]]

“Umm…. Mmm…” //Uh oh...//

He restarts his efforts at your sore feet. He massages them thoroughly before lightly brushing his fingertips over your toes.

“That tickles!”

Teddy works his way up your slender, toned body. You get so accustomed to your father’s pleasant touch that you don’t immediately object when he begins to spread your legs.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddymass2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddymass3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your dad gives you a light slap on your still sore bottom.

“Sorry, I couldn’t resist.”

Teddy applies a fresh dose of massage oil all over your body.

Shock and confusion makes you slow to react. Teddy takes your silence as assent and continues his massage on your naked, defenceless body.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddymass4.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

He then begins to work the hot oil into your shoulders, while you squirm underneath him, torn between misery and heaven.

“What are you… doing…? Mmmm…” //My body feels nice and warm...//

Your father&#39;s fingers brush against a spot so sensitive it sends a shock through your body. You tense up, knowing that you are close to crossing a very important line.

“Teddy, that’s enough… I&#39;m not feeling very good.” //Or too good, rather...//

“We are just getting to the good part!” Teddy protests.

“Fine, fine! Half a massage is half price,” Teddy says as he hands you $250. “Maybe next time you could give me one instead?”

“Uh… maybe… Sorry. //Bye!//” you reply as you grab the cash from Teddy and run.

“Holy fuck, I can’t believe I let him touch me like that. This is never happening again!” you declare once safe in the hallway.

You avoid the brothel like the plague. For the next few days you are occupied with schoolwork. Perhaps you dive into your studies to distract yourself from the ominously looming deadline that is rapidly approaching.

You notice an abnormally large crowd outside the establishment when you arrive. &quot;What the…? This place is packed!&quot; you remark once you get into the employee areas.

&quot;Yes!&quot; your boss agrees as he rushes up to you. &quot;Our star has arrived! And, yes, the truly exciting part is that this is a small part of the bidding pool. Lately, we have been getting over sixty percent of our bids online.&quot;

&quot;Wait, you mean all these people… they are here for //me//?&quot;

&quot;Of course my dear. You&#39;ve gone viral on our website. I think we will both do very well with this auction.&quot;

You are dumbstruck as the information sinks in. //All these weirdos want to have sex with me!?// &quot;How many people are here?&quot; you ask.

&quot;There are over a hundred and fifty gentlemen with verified accounts waiting in the lobby. You should go and greet them. They will want to see what they are buying up close.&quot;

Your popularity is a bit hard to enjoy. //All these guys are just interested in my body! I didn&#39;t even do anything!//

//Well, I guess if I already agreed to this shit then this part is pretty minor...//

There is a crowd of men in the lobby. None of them appear to be below the age of forty.

Just as you are going to start some awkward introductions, [[someone grabs your arm.]]

You scowl. “I’m out of your price range.”

“How do you know?”

//That’s right! There is no way my dad can compete with some of these other rich guys!//

“There is a lot of rich men here,” you answer with a gesture at the crowd. “Why are you here?”

“For the same reason as everyone else.”

“It’s nice to meet you. I’m Taylor!” you introduce yourself with forced cheerfulness nearly two dozen times.

A crowd forms around you and you are peppered with strange questions about your upbringing and preferences.

At the end of your numerous awkward exchanges, your face begins to hurt from fake-smiling so much.

//I really hope this pays off...//

You wait in anxious turmoil for an hour while the Proprietor completes the silent auction phase.

“The auction has concluded!” a jubilant Proprietor finally exclaims. He hands you an envelope with a smile. “I think you will be //very// pleased.”

The price makes your eyes pop... and the name on the writ makes you heart sink into the center of the earth.

You have been purchased by Teddy Roux for the sum of thirty six thousand dollars.

The paper drops from your hand. You stare into space until the horrible news sinks in.

“Mother-fucker!” you curse. //Or sonfucker!? Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkk!!! How could I be so dumb!? What the fuck do I do now!?//  “Commit suicide? Flee the country? FUCK!”

You hang your head in shame. Your hasty decision to sell yourself has come to bite you in the ass.

You began to gag and barely manage to fight off the urge to vomit as you dash for the washroom. 

You rinse off with scalding water and copious amounts of hand soap, rubbing your flesh until your face is red and splotchy.

After cleaning up, your mind shifts down the list of panic priorities. You are wearing only panties, and suddenly conscious of how exposed you are.

“Fuck, where did that big baby hide my shit?”

Using your arm as a makeshift bra, you return to Craig’s room to demand he return your clothing.

“But you look so good like that,” he pouts after you yell at him.

“That’s beside the point! Give me my damn clothes!” you shout.

Craig is happy to draw out the awkward exchange in order to further ogle your body. “Are you sure you want them?” he asks you.

“YES!”

“I don’t remember where I put them…”

“Craig! For fuck’s sake! After everything I did for you!?”

You hear the noise of tires on gravel, drawing you to the window.

As you glance outside, you see the bright headlights of a car pull into the driveway. [[Sirens of panic go off in your mind.]]

“Only i-if you promise to watch me tomorrow.”

“You think I want to come back here!?” //Screw that, we are so done!// You would swat Craig but the act would leave you exposed. //I am out of time!//

You hear the front door open downstairs. The sound makes your heart temporarily stop beating.

//Ahhh! This can’t be happening to me! If the Bells find me like this I might be the one who is finished! I am the one who is supposed to have a bit of common sense here! Fuck!//

“Fine! Craig -- //Now give them to me!//”

“Sure.” Craig reveals your clothes hidden under a nearby blanket. You snatch up the items and scramble to put them on, managing to finish dressing just as Sandra bursts into the room. 

Sandra enters without knocking. “Hey you two!” She cheerfully greets you. Thankfully, the mature redhead doesn’t pay your rumpled appearance any mind. She turns to Craig. “Did you have fun together?”

“Y-yes, Tammy’s the greatest!” Craig answers. “We had so much fun together!”

“That’s great! Craig was well behaved I assume?” Sandra wonders.

“Yeah, everything was fine…”

Eager to escape, you awkwardly say a stiff goodbye to Craig and retreat to the hall. Sandra follows you to the front door.

Sandra munches on her lower lip as she watches you put on your shoes. “Tammy, I know it is a bit much to ask after everything you’ve done for us… but… is there any chance you could come by again tomorrow evening?”

You barely manage to hide your sigh. [[“I already told Craig I would.”]]

“Yeah…”

“I will definitely take advantage of your kindness. Craig doesn’t have many friends, as you can probably guess. But I can tell Craig is really benefiting from a woman’s touch. You’re good for him. Thank you.”

//A woman’s touch…// “Sorry, it has been a long day. I’m a bit tired so I am going to head home if that’s alright!”

“Of course.” Sandra presses a wad of cash into your hand. “Want a ride?” she offers.

//I guess it would be weird to say I’m tired and then walk all the way home...//

You graciously accept and Sandra whisks you to an area up the street from your house. The ride is quiet; you distract yourself by listening to the radio and inhaling Sandra’s refreshing floral perfume.

“What a night…” you mumble as you get ready for bed. //How could I be so stupid?//

Sleep is elusive. You stare at the ceiling for an hour as you berate yourself for your stupidity. 

The next day, your humiliation at Craig’s hands is still fresh in your mind. You can’t shake a feeling of inadequacy. You imagine beating Craig’s smug ass in a variety of games, and find the fantasy to be very appealing.

//I shouldn’t even care that he beat me… It’s all the other stuff! Still, maybe a little revenge isn’t the worst thing in the world. He’s just so easy to underestimate with that dumb mug of his. I won’t make the same mistakes again.//

You find yourself drawn to your game system. You end up practicing a few of Craig’s favorite games for most of the day.

When evening rolls around, you’re still playing //Mega Blazers.//

You debate going back to the Bell’s residence. Eventually you decide that since you were coerced into acceptance it should be more than okay to cancel.

“Shit… What the heck am I doing? I can’t spend any more time with Craig!” //But I already told Craig and Sandra that I would...// “I’ll just say I’m sick or something.”

“Fuu!-- I mean hello!” you awkwardly greet Sandra.

“Hey Tammy! You’re still coming by tonight, right?” Sandra asks you.

“Uh... “

“I was wondering if you might come a bit early. You’ve been great with Craig,” Sandra continues before you can answer. “He seems happier and more attentive when it comes to his schoolwork… and then on top of that, you’ve given Jake and I some time for ourselves. I wanted to thank you again. You’re a genuine life saver!”

“You’re welcome.”

&quot;So, I was wondering if we could make this a more permanent ongoing relationship?  It will be very lucrative, I&#39;ll pay you a nurse&#39;s rate plus bonuses.  //Cash!// Plus, I have a little proposition you might be interested in too!&quot;

“Wow, that is a generous offer and what you said is very flattering…” 

//But it would mean spending a lot of time with Craig.  I am not sure I am comfortable being around him for that long… Especially given everything that has already happened between us...//

Sandra continues to unload. a barrage of compliments at you. In the end, you are unable to get out of your commitment.

//But this is definitely the last time I am babysitting this big man-child,// you quietly assure yourself.

You arrive at the Bell residence a short time later with a feeling of foreboding hanging over your head.

&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Sandra&quot; &quot;Sandra desc&quot;&gt;&gt; answers the door in fancy attire, clearly dressed to go out. 

“My heroine has arrived!”

You smile weakly in reply.

“I will back around 9:30. Have fun with Craig and see if you can help him with his studies if you have time. I might just throw you a //bonus// if his grades improve,” Sandra adds another task to your to do list with a sly wink. “You’re a peeeach~!” [[she coos as she steps out the door.]]

“Sorry, Craig,” you say as you peel him off you. “No games for me today. Your mom told me to get you to study.”

Craig’s enthusiasm vanishes. “I don’t wanna! Studying is //boring//!”

“So? You still have to do it. There are times in life when you just have to suck it up. Er...” Your choice of words leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

“Maybe I will… Can you give me a reward?”

You cross your arms over your breasts. “Rewards are //earned,// Craig.”

&quot;I understand.”

“So you’re going to study?”

“You just got here! I will study later!” he assures you. 

“Okay.”

“Tammy!  Do you want to see my computer?&quot; Craig offers.

Eager for a distraction, you agree.  You follow Craig upstairs and sit down next to his PC. &quot;Are we going to watch Vidtube?” you wonder. “I bet you like alien videos.&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah but I&#39;ve got something better!&quot; With impressive speed, Craig loads a search engine and types in &quot;handjob.&quot;

You are so shocked it takes you a couple of seconds to react. &quot;Craig, what are you doing!?&quot;

Craig turns to you with a look of immense anger but, like a flash of lightning, it is gone as quickly as it appeared. His features soften as he tears up. Just as you begin to feel bad that you overreacted, Craig&#39;s returns to his original state of mind. &quot;You aren&#39;t allowed to say that to me!  //I am normal!//&quot; he yells at you.

//Abnormal perhaps...// “Craig, this is not appropriate!”

“I just wanted to show you one of the cool things I found.” Craig opens a new window.

A young blonde with short hair has her shirt pulled up and a cock stuffed into her mouth. 

“I-if you want to do it again. I w-won’t say no.”

&quot;Uh… what? You eat fruit off the carpet?&quot;

&quot;No! It&#39;s a //snack.// I only get one when I am really good,&quot; an irritated Craig explains.

//Oh, he wants a candy bribe… What a child.//

You are so dumbfounded it takes you an extra few seconds to react. &quot;CRAIG! Don&#39;t eat the fucking plastic!&quot; you shout but Craig begins choking before you finish the sentence. &quot;Aww shit, if you die I am totally going to get in trouble!&quot;

Craig falls to the ground and begins flopping around.

&quot;I need… CPR....&quot; Craig wheezes. 

&quot;No you don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;You need to… kiss me before it is too late.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

When it becomes apparent you aren’t buying Craig’s act, he sits up. “You almost let me die!” he accuses you.

“No, I didn’t,” you flatly shut down that line of argument.

“You owe me,” Craig insists. “For the child neglect.”

“You’re not a child and I didn’t neglect you. I would have saved you but you’re a naughty little trickster who deserves to choke on his fruit carpet.” 

Craig’s disappointment is short lived. “H-how about I will study if you make it interesting.”

Craig’s persistence would be impressive if he wasn’t focusing his efforts on you. “Wow. You just never give up do you?”

“W-when there is something I really want, I can become a little obsessed,” Craig admits.

“I am not a //thing,// Craig.”

“You’re so pretty!” Craig deflects.

Scowling, you reply, “What’s that got to do with anything?”

“//Everything//,” the young man answers quietly, his round face sombre.

You sigh, suddenly feeling even more jumbled-up than usual. Craig’s persistence annoys and yet flatters you at the same time, although the feelings are far from equal measure. Craig is clearly smitten by you… or rather your new body. //He is just being a normal guy… kind of,// you rationalize. //And being desired and idolized a bit isn’t the worst experience in the world… as I long I don’t have to do anything gross. Ahhh,  hope I am not just sugarcoating all this demeaning bullshit!//

//Wait… I already said no games! But… Fucking smug ass Craig… Grrrr….// There remains a gaping void in your self-confidence. Craig has made you feel oddly inferior. You have an intense desire to earn back a bit of your pride.

//I practiced a lot earlier today, so I know I can give him a few surprises.// 

“Let’s play! Let’s play! Let’s play!” Craig shouts.

//Damnit, am I going to get goaded into his little traps again!?// You know you’re treading on dangerous ground but you want nothing more than to wipe Craig’s mocking smile from his face with a true demo of your skills. 

An image of Drew floats through your head. //That’s right, what would Drew think if he knew I kept getting my ass kicked by this guy? // You and Drew have aced hundred of games so you have a vast amount of experience to draw from. Now, calm and familiarized with several of Craig’s games, you are confident that you can best him.

As long as I don’t agree to any dumb bets I should be fine.//

As you accept the challenge, Craig’s cheering becomes almost ear-piercing.

When you finally get him to calm down, he quickly decides on a //Mega Blazers// rematch and gallops off upstairs before you can reply.

You warily follow Craig, hoping your sliver of confidence can be gambled into a significantly greater sum. //Now let’s just hope I don’t fuckin’ lose again or I’m jumpin’ out a window.//

“Let’s make a promise,” Craig suggests as he turns on the console.

“No weird promises!” you cut him off with a wave of your hand.

“Just normal promises then,” he answers with a nod. “I promise to have fun.”

“Okay...?”

“You need to promise too!” the portly manchild insists.

“Sure, I can do that one. I promise. Sheesh, now let’s play.” As the game’s start screen appears, you realize [[Craig has substituted //Mega Blazers// for a different fighting game you don’t recognize.]]

“C’mon, you want to get a good price, right? Now hop on that bed and look //ravishing//,” Rhea instructs.

//Ravishing…? I don’t want to get ravished!//

Your face must say it all. Rhea throws her head back and laughs.

“Taylor, it’s fine,” Rhea assures you. “Just put on something sexy yet cute from the wardrobe over there. Be conservative - you’re trying to show off but not reveal “the goods,”” Rhea advises.

“No problem there.”

You put on stockings and a black lace teddy. Although you feel a bit foolish, you obediently arch you back and strike a sexy pose for Rhea.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/brotheltay.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmmmrrow!” Rhea purrs. “Fuck… I kind of want to ravish you myself.”

“Not if I ravish you first!” you counter. [[With feline grace, you pounce on Rhea.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2405" name="With feline grace, you pounce on Rhea." tags="" position="2870,15005" size="100,100">As your lips touch, every worry melts away until the only thing remaining is Rhea.

“I really like this side of you!” Rhea says in between kisses.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheataykissing3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
One kiss leads to another, then another… you find it difficult to contain yourself.

You make out until sadly Rhea stops you. 

“We should totally get some guys to pay us to watch while do this,” she suggests.

“Ohhh man, you mean we can get paid to mess around?”

“Of course. That’s the whole point of this place.”

//[[This might just be my dream job!]]//

Your female hands strain to cover the entirety of Rhea’s breasts.  “These are amazing!” you compliment Rhea as you grope her unabashed.

“Geez, Taylor. You’re such a //boy// sometimes. Here, I’ll let you get a much closer look if you want,” Rhea says as she lowers her top and her freed mammaries spill forth.

“Oh heck yes! Rhea, you’re the best!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheababysuckle.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You latch onto her breast and suckle Rhea’s lovely bosom like a hungry newborn.

Rhea’s fingers probe your panties. “Mmmm… I’m not sure which one of us is more aroused here. “That’s enough, Taylor. I’m feeling a bit hungry and I want a //main course//.”

Your clothing goes flying as you take turns undressing. [[Rhea’s head inevitably descends on your most naughty, sensitive bits.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2407" name="Rhea’s head inevitably descends on your most naughty, sensitive bits." tags="" position="2898,15118" size="100,100">“Mmm. I love how you taste,” Rhea whispers to you as her kisses move down your thighs to nibble on your labia. She runs her tongue right down your landing strip and the center of your vagina, each playful move compounding your arousal until you are a wet, quivering mess.

You thrash around while Rhea works her masterful tongue deep inside your crevice of love.

//Ahhh… This is too much!//

“Unnnnggaaahuhhh!! Rhhhheeeeeaaaa aaaaaaaah!” you cry as you mash your throbbing sex into Rhea’s mouth, cumming with the vapid intensity of an animal in heat.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheataycumming.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After Rhea gets you off, you return the favor.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rheatayfingering.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your finger easily slips into Rhea’s drooling pussy. You explore her soft, slick flesh until she tenses up. Once you’ve found a good spot you proceed to pound Rhea’s pussy with your fingers until your arm nearly cramps and Rhea finally topples onto you as she shudders in the throes of the zenith of her passion.

“Hwaah! Oh… Sorry... My legs got kind of weak there,” Rhea apologizes with a blush. You find her unexpected shy side to be cute.

“I know the feeling…”

You lie panting side by side your friend, waiting for the world to stop spinning.

With your lust receding, you become more clear headed. “Where are those photos going to end up?” you wonder.

“In the sweaty palms and fap-cabinets of those in the //Platinum Palace Network,//” Rhea sniggers.

Rhea’s comment causes the reemergence of your lingering doubts. //[[I really hope I am making the right decision with this whole brothel thing…]]//

“I can’t believe I was feeling good about this whole auction thing… I must be a huge dumbass.”

//That’s right… ANYONE could win me… I shouldn’t be excited, this is really dangerous! There are SO many weirdos out there that could be bidding on me-- oh fuck!//

&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; Roux sits down beside you. He studies your face intently for a long moment, his own features unreadable.

Just as you begin to suspect that he genuinely recognizes you, Ted speaks:

“When I first saw you, well my heart caught in my throat and I thought I was going to die… It made me really sad that we didn’t get to spend more time together.”

“You didn’t die,” you coldly observe. [[“I can’t believe you have the nerve to even speak to me after last night.”]]

You plead your case with tears in your eyes.

Your boss seems disappointed. “Taylor, you can’t get out of this.”

“What if I just leave?”

“Then all you will have accomplished will be to delay the inevitable and aggravate a valued client. This is not how we conduct business here.”

“I’m sorry…”

“Why agree in the first place if you weren’t absolutely certain you wanted to follow through?” the Proprietor asks you, perplexed.

“I didn’t expect Teddy to win. I’d rather //anybody// else. Seriously! ANYONE would be better!”

“He seems like a gentleman. You could have done far worse. Frankly, I don’t see what your issue is.”

“No, you don’t understand…”

“I want you to apologize for your rudeness. You’re going to give him a bonus blowjob on the house to show him there iare no hard feelings.”

“No, I’m not!”

The old man shrugs. “I doubt you can find a suitable excuse that will sway me.”

[[“I will do anything except that!”]]
[[“I am not blowing my dad!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2410" name="“I will do anything except that!”" tags="" position="3246,16101" size="100,100">“You must satisfy the client. As long he’s happy, I don’t care what you do together. But, given what he paid for, I think that there is only one thing that will satisfy him.”

The walls keep crumbling around you. “My life is ruined…”

“Here, this will help.” You hear a drawer open. Your boss throws you a packet of tablets.

“What’s this?”

“It’s something to help you suppress your anxiety. I know nerves can become a bit frayed at important times. You must perform and please the client.” 

//Please the client… Oh man, even thinking about that is enough to give me a nervous breakdown!//

“This is merely a minor sedative and pain reliever,” your boss adds.

You gratefully accept the packet.

“What about these? Has Rhea spoken to you?” the Proprietor asks, while pushing forward a second set of familiar pills.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/birthcontrol.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh god…”

“Your earning potential will be impacted if you become pregnant,” he warns.

“Rhea already gave me the pep-talk.”

“I see. Have you started taking them? You will want to before your big night.”

“No… but I will.” The mere possibility of getting pregnant with your father’s child is enough to make you want to burn down the entire city in a fit of madness.

“No better time than the present. You should take three to start. The earlier the better; it takes a while for them to kick in. If you want to work here it is a prudent course.”

Your boss walks to a watercooler present in the corner of his office and brings you a glass.

You swallow three blue pills down into your already queasy stomach.

[[“The other ones I will let you use at your own discretion.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2411" name="“I am not blowing my dad!”" tags="" position="3362,16074" size="100,100">“Your… //DAD?//” the Proprietor repeats, perplexed.

“Yes, he’s my dad! Look at my ID!” You hand over your driver’s license.

The old man’s eyes go wide as he studies your card. “Taylor //Roux//?! What the…? Why the hell didn’t you say anything sooner!?”

“Because I thought could get him to fuck off! Instead, he just became even more creepy and persistent! I can’t believe that fucking creep is even here, let alone frittering all his money away on sleazy women… er...”

The Proprietor becomes gravely quiet. “This ID card is for a male,” he observes. “One that clearly has more than a passing resemblance…”

//Oh fuck me!//

The old man returns to his desk and removes his glasses to rub at his face. “I’ve been doing this for a long time. Not once have I ever made the mistake of hiring a man instead of a woman. I have a good eye for this stuff. Maybe I am getting old… You know, I still would have hired such a cute boy as yourself. There is a large market for that sort of thing.”

“I’m a girl now!”

Your boss shrugs. “That’s fine. I don’t care about your sexual proclivities. What I demand from my employees, however, is //honesty//. Why didn’t you mention that you were a male in the first place?”

“I am not a male! Well, I mean… I am but, fuck... It’s really hard to explain! A bunch of crazy shit happened and now I am working here because I need money,” you lamely explain.

“Ah, I see. To complete your transition into a woman.”

“What!? No! That’s not what I am trying to do!”

The Proprietor crosses his arms over his chest. He is clearly getting frustrated. “Do you still have a penis?” he questions you.

“No! I am doing all this shit to get it back!”

“...Um I see... Women make substantially more than men in this field… for the most part.”

“I don’t care about that!”

“I think I understand now. You were born a male and transitioned to a female. The surgery must have been very expensive and placed you in considerable debt. But your body dysmorphia has stayed with you and now you desire to return to your old way of life.”

[[“I didn’t have fucking surgery!”]]
[[“Yeah… that’s right.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2412" name="“I didn’t have fucking surgery!”" tags="" position="3592,16089" size="100,100">“Then how did you become the way you are now?” the old man asks you as he replaces his glasses.

“I… I got sick at school. I went home and, after a few days of pain, I came out like this.”

“You became a beautiful woman overnight?” he asks, his voice dripping with skepticism.

“Over a few days,” you clarify.

“How?”

“I don’t know. I am working here to pay for a possible cure.”

“A cure? Why would you want a cure?”

“I just want to go back to the way I was.”

“Hmm… I wonder: is such a thing even possible?”

“Are you going to help me out or not?”

“I am still not sure I believe you.”

“I don’t blame you.” //I know I sound crazy as fuck!//

The Proprietor stares you down. After a tense evaluation, he finally agrees to spare you.

“Alright, you don’t have do anything until I look into this.”

“Thank you!”

You feel like an anvil has been removed from your shoulders. “Oh thank god! You’re a lifesaver!”

“Platinum Palace Penthouse room #7 8pm Saturday - wear something sexy. I bet you look ravishing in red. I can’t wait. -Teddy.”

“That makes one of us… Oh man… Is this really happening?” //Yes, yes it is. I have to do it… I’m literally fucked...//

The appointed date approaches at lightning speed. You try and distract yourself and that only seems to erode your time even more rapidly. 

You sleep poorly nearly every night. At school you are irritable, snapping at your friends.

By the time you get home on Friday night, you feel like you are ready to leap out of your new skin.

When even a hot bath fails to soothe your frayed nerves, reminding you uncomfortably of your new body, you find yourself drawn to the anxiety medicine that the Proprietor passed along to you.

You are reminded of the //other// pills. You take out the packet of birth control and take a starter dose of three pills which you set down on the table.

Taking them would be a further acknowledgment of the path you’ve embarked upon.

“I shouldn’t take these. But…” 

You imagine getting pregnant with your father’s child and become so disgusted by the thought you pop the birth control pills into your mouth.”

“Now I can have safe sex…” //With my dad...// “Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!”

You hold up the second packet. //I know I shouldn’t rely on drugs but… I just need to get through two more nights. He doesn’t know it’s me so as long as I can tough it out and the big creep gets what he wants then maybe we can all move past this. I will ditch Teddy, delete the memories of Saturday night with a gallon of tequila and then head first into Rhea’s pussy until I can transform back into a dude.//

You close your eyes and drift off.

When you wake up, you feel like it’s your last day on earth.

You try to savour every second before your inevitable encounter. 

After glancing at the clock far too often, you decide to take more of the anxiety medicine.

To calm a slight nervous tremor in your hand, you take triple the dose you did the night before.

The pills don’t seem to have any immediate effect. As evening rolls around, you feel even more anxious so you take a few more.

“Wait a minute… I feel //odd.//”

A lovely enveloping warmth trickles through your body. The feelings continue to concentrate in your lower abdomen. Your nipples become noticeably engorged. Your clitoris buzzes while your pussy begins to ache with yearning.

“Holy fuck, these things are an aphrodisiac! My body is on fire! I am all tingly and… oh no! Hwah… Huahh… Oh no…”

You know that if you go to the meeting as you are now bad things will definitely happen.

//But they were going to happen anyway, right? Maybe this is for the best and will make things easier for me?//

You shiver as you imagine the night’s trajectory playing out.

You guzzle a glass of water but it does nothing to cool you off.

“I’m running out of time… I either jump out the window or go through with this…”

You decide to check out what Rhea picked for you to wear.

Stars and spots of color float through your vision until it&#39;s filled by images of a life that is not your own.

The images stream through your mind&#39;s eye with an accelerating pace until it resembles a strobe light. The light intensifies in brightness until it feels like you are staring at the sun.

&quot;Gaaaaaaaaah! Fuck! What is happening to me?!&quot;

&quot;Uh oh…There appears to be a //minor modchip malfunction//…&quot; worries the Envoy. &quot;I have never witnessed such a reaction. I must take notes…&quot;

For a tense minute you feel like you are sitting in a live electric chair. Strange memories and information flood into your mind. As if watching a movie, a series of flashbacks blaze before your eyes.

After what feels like an agonizing few hours, you sit up on the park bench feeling like you have just woken up from the most intense and restless dream of your life.

Your mind is in absolute shambles. Strange thoughts, impulses, and memories bounce around your mind. &quot;What happened to me?!&quot; 

The Envoy studies your face closely. &quot;I apologize. I have done hundreds of insertions and I have never seen such a negative reaction. There is often a jarring &quot;reboot&quot; phase, but yours was several standard deviations away from the norm. Relax, you seem to be beyond the worst of it. I&#39;m confident you will make a full recovery.&quot;

Your mind has been shattered and the discombobulated pieces now float through your subconscious, making you unsure which thoughts are your own and which have been planted.

You give yourself a soft slap and return to reality. To your surprise, you find that you are feeling oddly pent up, like you need to go for a jog ASAP.

&quot;Wait… what happens if I succeed? Is this like my new job now? Man, I think I might have just accidently joined the fucking mafia or something…&quot; 

The next morning you wake up, unsure if the past few weeks were a merely a bizarre dream.

You give your breasts a confirmatory squeeze. &quot;I&#39;m still a chick… but that //other part// was definitely a dream, right?&quot;

The phone you were given from the Envoy buzzes.

&quot;Oh fuck.&quot;

&quot;The car will arrive in 15 minutes,&quot; reads a text message from a contact marked as &quot;home.&quot;

It takes more concentration and effort than expected, but after a few false starts, you finally manage to push the right mental buttons to trigger your transformation.

Your body becomes malleable as you direct the sculpting process.

Reducing your height is the most difficult and uncomfortable. Your bones seem to compress and twist awkwardly until you have produced the lean, balanced figure of Ariana Mucho that you hold in your mind&#39;s eye.

//Wow, Ari&#39;s eyes are so big they really draw you in…//

You blink in surprise. &quot;How long have I been staring at myself?&quot; 

Ever since the chip has been installed, you find yourself easily distracted. You spend most of your time in a half-daze. You enact unusual mannerisms such as playing with your hair without thinking.

&quot;I do look really good though…&quot;

//I bet Ariana is the most vain woman ever...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aribeauty.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You pull down your panties, [[curious to explore any other changes you may have undergone.]]

&quot;Geez, this thing is tiny! Ahh… I guess it matches the rest of me? Fuck… I bet I couldn&#39;t even get a finger in there if I tried...&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aripussypov.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Wow…&quot; //This is a celebrity pussy! Except it&#39;s mine...//

You realize that you have neglected your extremities. After a few false starts, you are finally able to reduce the size of your feet and hands to the almost childlike size that fits Ariana&#39;s profile.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/arifeet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You admire your backside in the mirror. &quot;Holy shit! How does she have such long looking legs with this small-ass body? Is my life an optical illusion? I&#39;m like a sexy midget!&quot;

//Sexy… Sexy… Sexy...// The word echoes through your mind.

You feel a tingle of exhilaration as you turn around and shake your ass.

You dress into more suitable clothes and then head out to enjoy the rest of your flight.

When you land, you are [[greeted by a man in a suit who chauffeurs you to a lavish Californian mansion.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2423" name="greeted by a man in a suit who chauffeurs you to a lavish Californian mansion." tags="" position="5875,21900" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/arimansion.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The mansion is absolutely extravagant. Apparently Ms Mucho&#39;s career is even more lucrative than you suspected. You note there are at least five well dressed men walking the building&#39;s perimeter. //Are those guys guards?// you wonder.

A familiar stunning young woman greets you just inside the backdoor.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ari.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Even in modest cornflower blue, Ariana and her lustrous red hair and bright eyes and smile light up the room.

&quot;Wow, it&#39;s really you!&quot; //Do I really look like that too?//

The young popstar smiles. &quot;I think I am just as impressed. [[When I requested the Agency send me a double I didn&#39;t think you would be this convincing.]]&quot;

&quot;Hi!&quot; Ariana smiles but doesn&#39;t offer a further unnecessary introduction.

Unsure how to make small-talk with such a famous person, you decide to remain as professional as possible. //That&#39;s right! I&#39;m pro-spy Taylor and I&#39;m gonna solve this fuckin&#39; mystery!// &quot;So, what&#39;s the plan?&quot;

&quot;Um. My security manager said the less you know, the better,&quot; Ari responds.

&quot;Whhhaat? How does that make sense? How can I help if I don&#39;t know anything?&quot;

Ariana turns her head to the side. &quot;The Agency said you&#39;d be fully trained.&quot;

The dull throb of the modchip reminds you of your commitment. &quot;That part should be okay. I&#39;m trained,&quot; you insist. //Kind of...//

&quot;What&#39;s my number seven grossing hit?&quot; Ari quizzes you.

The answer pops into your mind. &quot;Escape.&quot;

&quot;How many fans were at my show in Baltimore last August?&quot;

&quot;Sixty two thousand… All there to see you, Ariana.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s my manager&#39;s first name?&quot;

&quot;John.&quot;

&quot;What are the opening lyrics to //Lullaby?//&quot;

&quot;♪ You know when I&#39;m in deep and I just can&#39;t sleep,
I just waa~aant you to know, 
That I&#39;m right here for yooouuu~
So baby don&#39;t cry,
Listen to my lullaby,
And I will take all the worries away!♪&quot;

Ariana is probably as shocked at your performance as you are. &quot;That was… pretty good,&quot; she admits. &quot;Okay, I believe you. You&#39;re the real deal! These Agency guys are awesome!&quot;

[[&quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2425" name="&quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot;" tags="" position="5824,22196" size="100,100">Ariana&#39;s bubbly attitude vanishes. &quot;I want you to keep me safe and give me some breathing room. Every year things get worse. The stage got jumped at my last show.&quot; Ari sighs. &quot;And of course that nutcase at the stadium attacked my fans. There are crazy people coming out of the woodwork!&quot;

//Geez, who would want to hurt Ariana? She&#39;s precious!// &quot;I&#39;ll protect you with my life!&quot; you pledge.

&quot;You&#39;re sweet. And good looking too,&quot; she jokes before her mirth evaporates and Ariana&#39;s eyes become watery. &quot;But I am a wreck lately because last month my producer took her own life… according to the police. She was one of my best friends.&quot;

&quot;Wow, that&#39;s awful. I&#39;m very sorry,&quot;

&quot;Alice would never do something like that! She was the happiest person I know. I just gave her a big bonus right before… before it all happened…&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t even cash the check. She was so excited to go to visit her children… I refuse to believe she killed herself.&quot;

//Yeah, if I was going to off myself I&#39;d definitely drain my bank accounts first for one last hurrah. Or burn it. Or give it to charity… Still, it seems suspicious but I&#39;m just speculating. I don&#39;t know anything about Alice.//

&quot;Oh, of course! Anything you need - I&#39;m here for you.&quot;

Ariana gives you an appreciative smile before sighing. The young woman is clearly exhausted.

&quot;Is there any chance you can you take my appointments for today?&quot;

&quot;You mean //in your place?//&quot;

&quot;Why do you think I paid so much for you? It&#39;s an easy day… I have appearances to maintain, but I haven&#39;t felt like myself lately.&quot;

&quot;I can relate with that…&quot;

&quot;Great. We will touch base tomorrow. Just don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t!&quot; she says teasingly as she tosses you a small digital daytimer.

You pop it open and it&#39;s packed with pretentious sounding appointments and various engagements from photoshoots to charity balls.

//You&#39;ve got to be kidding me...//

&quot;Leandra!&quot; Ari calls over a middle aged woman. &quot;Leandra helps me keep my appointments and stuff.&quot;

The maid&#39;s eyes go wide when she spots the two of you side by side. You and Ariana laugh.

&quot;Leandra please help out my twin sister, Taylor! She&#39;s taking over for me as of //right now//,&quot; Ms Mucho orders without further explanation before excusing herself.

You clutch the daytimer while looking at the apprehensive maid.

&quot;Dance practice… cute photo shoot… meet Mr. Reiner, electrolysis, do something in public to look sexy… What is this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s her schedule... Ari often includes little goals for publicity and the like.&quot;

&quot;I see…&quot;

The maid leans in close. &quot;Are you //really// her twin sister?&quot;

[[&quot;Yes.&quot;|ariyes]]
[[&quot;No, of course not!&quot;]]

&quot;Thanks. So uh, do I really have to dance?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re related to one of the richest women in the world. You can do whatever you want… within the confines of your schedule. Those limits are self imposed. I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re here to help,&quot; she adds. &quot;Ari usually starts the day with a workout. Why don&#39;t you try that? She hasn&#39;t been to the gym in a few days.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay, I can do that. That sounds a hell of a lot better than dancing!&quot;

Halfway to the car, you stop dead in your tracks. From head to heel, your body tingles. Your right hand begins to shake and when you attempt to steady it with your left, your touch tiggers a sensation akin to electrocution.

&quot;Gaaahhh…!&quot; you grunt as the pain spreads.

&quot;Taylor! Are you alright!?&quot;

The pain vanishes just as quickly as it came on.

&quot;I am fine. Sorry I had a sore spot there…&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t go to the gym then!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine! I will just run for a bit. It&#39;s not as bad as it seems!&quot; you stretch without incident to demonstrate your good health.

&quot;Fffu…&quot;

//Tzzzt! Zap!// Tiny jolts emanate from deep under the injection site behind your ear. The strange melody from earlier returns, much louder than ever before. The sound continues to increase to the point that is deafening before it levels off just as the phrase &quot;Modchip malfunction&quot; goes tumbling through your head.

&quot;Uh oh…&quot; You are a bundle of regrets. //Fucking sketchy brain surgery! That definitely wasn&#39;t my best moment.//

Eventually the shocking sensation ceases. Your worry fades away along with it.

&quot;Miss, we&#39;ve arrived,&quot; the driver interrupts your train of thought.

You step outside shaky legs, swaying side to side under the chauffeur&#39;s eye. 

//Heh… He is looking at my butt! Ari clearly loves shaking her little money maker! Being sexy and provocative earns her a lot of fame, money, and fans...//

&quot;That&#39;s right… if I show off in her body I&#39;d be //helping// her! And that&#39;s my job!&quot; the rationalization makes you disturbingly happy.

//Wait, that isn&#39;t right ...//

//Zzzaappp!//

&quot;Ah… fuck, I feel kind of warm… Focus Taylor, I mean //Ari// heh...&quot;

&quot;Welcome Ariana! Leandra called ahead and gave Mike a heads up. He&#39;s waiting for you in the VIP area,&quot; [[a receptionist greets you, snapping you out of your daze.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2430" name="a receptionist greets you, snapping you out of your daze." tags="" position="5899,22796" size="100,100">&quot;Thanks.&quot; //Of course Ariana has her own personal trainer… So much for a quick private workout to gather my thoughts...//

The trainer, apparently a man named Mike, has the glow of youth about him. He is in such good shape you suspect even his toes are toned. It takes you an uncomfortable amount of effort to pull your eyes away.

//Er, I guess he is sort of cute… but no one is cuter than Ariana Mucho! --Which is me… Fuck.//

&quot;Ari!&quot; the trainer greets you. You are a bit surprised when he sweeps you up in a bearhug and kisses you on the cheek.

Your body temperature rises another twenty degrees. There is //definitely// something wrong with you. &quot;Hi…&quot;

&quot;Ahh, Ari are you putting on the shy, cute act today? That&#39;s always been my favorite,&quot; he teases you.

//It&#39;s not an act!// &quot;Yeah… Do you, uh, kiss all your clients?&quot;

&quot;Only the pretty ones,&quot; the trainer answers. &quot;Now are you ready to work out?&quot;

&quot;Of course! I am up for anything you can throw at me!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s start with some cardio. Might as well use these fancy machines.&quot;
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ariworkout.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
You work up a sweat on an elliptical machine. Instead of tired, you just get further //warmed up.//

For the next twenty minutes your tiny legs pump like mad.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ariworkout2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[&quot;I think we should work your glutes next,&quot;]] decides Mike.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2431" name="&quot;I think we should work your glutes next,&quot;" tags="" position="5899,22946" size="100,100">With hands on your hips, the trainer directs you into a proper squatting position.

&quot;I know you like to keep your cute little booty in top shape.&quot;

&quot;Um, yep!&quot;

&quot;I will spot for you and watch your form.&quot; 

&quot;Sure…&quot;

The trainer loads up a bar with several large weights.

//I am fucking tiny, how much weight does he expect me to lift?// you wonder.

&quot;Alright. Nice and steady now,&quot; instructs the trainer. You begin to deadlift.

After a few small sets, your leg muscles are burning.

//Clunk!// As the weight hits the floor, you stumble back on the young man&#39;s groin. You can clearly feel the outline of something //overly firm.//

&quot;Oooh. I like the way you think!&quot;

&quot;It was an accident.&quot;

&quot;Come on, babe! We still have time for a quick one on one session!&quot;

&quot;....&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? We do it all the time!&quot; 

&quot;//We do!?//&quot;

&quot;All the time! I thought this was a highlight for both of us!&quot;

//Is Ariana some kind of nympho or something?//

You raise an eyebrow in confusion. Your feelings quickly change to alarm when the trainer slides down his shorts, revealing a beefy erection.

You are completely speechless.

//Does he have this kind of relationship with Ariana!?// That is hard to believe but the proof is staring right at you. //Am I feeling like this because Ariana does? This gym session was unscheduled… Mike could be Ariana&#39;s boyfriend! Oh man, what do I do? What would Ariana Mucho do?!//

//Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzztttt!//

&quot;Haah…&quot; 

//Don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t!// Ariana&#39;s voice echoes through your thoughts, reminiscent of a strange melody you can&#39;t quite seem to place.

[[Play along with the trainer]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2432" name="Play along with the trainer" tags="" position="5899,23096" size="100,100">//I should just go with the flow… I don&#39;t want to blow my cover on my first day!//

&quot;Let&#39;s get nasty, babe.&quot;

&quot;Naast--?&quot; //Zzztt!//

Mike wraps his hands around your hips. He caresses your soft yet firm buttcheeks.

&quot;Wait… Ahh…&quot; //Zzzaap!// A cascade of shocks emanate from the chip … and from the areas where the trainer is touching you. He reaches around and places his palm on the outline of your genitals. Mike brushes his fingers against you and you can do nothing except shiver.

&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really sensitive today!&quot; Mike remarks. Guided by your moans, his groping efforts intensifies. The trainer teases your suddenly hard nipples as he works your clothes off.

You feel yourself becoming more malleable with each passing moment. Mike plays you like a fiddle. With one determined  hand massaging your breast and the other vibrating over the front of your vagina, you are conscious that your internal pressure is building to critical levels.

Yet, nestled in this man&#39;s strong arms, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do except give in.

You orgasm despite your best efforts to hold out. At the same instant as your climax, the modchip goes haywire.

//Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp!//

&quot;Aahhhhhhhhhhhgaa….&quot;

&quot;Pretty fun warm up, hey?&quot;

Your head feels like it is supported by a wet noodle. You nod as best you can. 

&quot;I want to look at your ass while I fuck you,&quot; Mike growls.

//What…!?// &quot;I…&quot;

//[[What would Ariana do?]]//

//Zzztt!//

Mike lies down on the bench and you mount him reverse cowgirl style. You grab Mike&#39;s hard cock and direct it into your pussy as if it is the most normal and natural course of action. You sink down and let gravity do its work.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/aritrainer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The trainer&#39;s huge dick impales your petite frame. To your astonishment, your tiny hole accepts nearly half his length.

You feel Mike&#39;s dick pierce you to your very core. In an instant, you are filled beyond capacity. Your virginity is history before you even comprehend what is happening.

&quot;Unnnnghhh… Uhh… Uhh...&quot;

&quot;Ahhh yeah! This is the best kind of exercise!&quot;

You grab onto the metal bar in front of you and use it to lever yourself up and down on the trainer&#39;s girthy cock.

Part of you is screaming to stop but it fades until muted, leaving only the physical realities of your sex. You fall into a rhythm, urged on by a comforting melody dancing through your head. 

&quot;Uhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;

Strong hands squeeze your ass while your vagina is stretched to its limits. The pain lessens with every strike until only a new world of pleasure remains.

&quot;Ahh… Fuck, Ari, you&#39;re so tight! You&#39;re squeezing me way more than usual! Your ass is perfect. This glutes routine is totally ace… Ahhh!&quot; huffs the trainer, lost in the delusions of pleasure.

Just as you become somewhat accustomed to what is happening, the pace of Mike&#39;s thrusting picks up until you and Mike reach the zenith of pleasure at nearly the same time.

You cum hard, shaking on top of a rapidly moving penis belonging to a man you barely know.

The cock withdraws at the last moment, with a soft //plop//, spraying your lower back with white fluid. //Spluuuurt!//

&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot;

Your orgasm triggers a chain reaction. The chip buzzes with such intensity it takes about a minute for the ringing in your ears to recede. 

//Zap!//

&quot;Are you alright, Ari?&quot;

&quot;Ahh…&quot;

[[You thank Mike for the &quot;workout&quot; and walk bow legged back to the car.]]

As you sit down in the car, you spot the day planner that you must have left behind. You&#39;ve had enough weird experiences for one day so you leave it alone.

&quot;Take me, uh, //home// please,&quot; you request.

You are whisked back to Ariana&#39;s mansion.

Leandra prepares you a nice meal. You are so famished you devour every morsel.

While eating, you notice one of the guards is giving you a strange look. //Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be such a pig when I am not even wearing my own face...//

When you wave back the man looks away in a lame attempt to hide the fact he was staring. 

Nearly every time you look up, the same man is peeking at you. You finally glare at him and the creepy guard retreats from view.

After dinner you plead exhaustion and Leandra directs you to a guest room.

//I don&#39;t think this chip is working properly...// You decide to turn in early but find yourself lying in bed, unable to fall asleep.

//Gzzzzt!//

&quot;Ahh…&quot;

Your hands are drawn to your tingling crotch. To your surprise, [[you discover that you&#39;ve soaked through your underwear.]]

&quot;Fuuuuck! I can&#39;t take it anymore!&quot;

You change positions, draping yourself over a nearby chair. Then you treat your clit like soft putty, easing your fingers deeper inside yourself with every cycle of your pleasure sweeping.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/arihorny.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Gaaaaaaaaaahhhh! Oh, fuck, finally, I am so close!&quot;

You chase down the dream lingering on the horizon like a dying man and then you almost literally cum your brains out.

&quot;Hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh….&quot; //Gzzzzzzztt! Zzzzz!//

Your eyes roll back in your head as you convulse and seizure. Pain and pleasure merge into a glorious crescendo of passion unlike anything you&#39;ve ever experienced before.

You recover in silence until your thirst drives you back into action.

As you hop out of bed, you notice there is blood on the pillow. //Holy shit! My ear is bleeding! That can&#39;t be good.//

As you begin the trek to the other side of the mansion, [[you hear the noises of someone rummaging around the kitchen]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2436" name="you hear the noises of someone rummaging around the kitchen" tags="" position="5899,23696" size="100,100">The late hour makes you cautious. You creep silently to the kitchen where you discover one of the guards standing over a bowl of fruit, with a syringe held in hand.

&quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; you interrupt the assailant.

&quot;Wha!? //Ariana!// I uhh… oh thank Christ, it&#39;s //you.// You scared the hell out of me.&quot;

&quot;//What are you doing?//&quot; you repeat with more emphasis.

&quot;The same as you. //The mission//.&quot;

//What mission!?// It is pretty obvious that you and this man may have conflicting goals. &quot;What&#39;s in the syringe? Are you //poisoning// those apples?&quot; you bravely question the much more formidable man. You are so perplexed that you speak bluntly before your sense of self preservation returns. //I&#39;m looking for a potential murderer… um… and it looks like candidate number one is standing right in front of me!//

&quot;You&#39;re new, so I don&#39;t think you understand how things operate around here. Do not disturb the //groundwork!//&quot; the fruit tamperer huffs. &quot;If you fuck with the mission, you will be //terminated.//&quot;

Without a further word, the rogue agent dashes off.

After closer inspection, you can see tiny pinholes on most of the fruit. //Wow… I&#39;m definitely eating out from now on.//

You return to your room with a glass of water, wondering if the mission you have been given is in fact the same as the other security members. &quot;I&#39;m trying to //help// Ariana and these assholes are definitely doing more than merely guarding her. What the hell did I get myself into?&quot;

//There is something extra weird going on here... //

You meet with your client over breakfast. You feel obliged to tell her about the incident last night but that is tempered by the idea that your new &quot;colleagues&quot; would definitely not approve.

&quot;How was your night? Sleep well?&quot; Ariana asks you over a breakfast of fresh fruit cocktail.

[[Tell Ariana about the fruit tamperer]]

&quot;I caught one of the guards poisoning it last night.&quot;

&quot;What the fuck!? Which guard!?&quot;

Ariana listens in silence as you relate the tale.

&quot;That&#39;s disgusting. That guy is //toast!//&quot;

You manage to convince Ariana to hold off on the &quot;toast&quot; part until after you&#39;ve gleaned some information from him.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; the celebrity relents. &quot;But do it now. I want that poisoner off my property and in jail by the end of the day!&quot;

You pledge to get to the bottom of things. 

&quot;I will do my best.&quot; You head outside, feeling like you are walking on eggshells with every step. 

You spot the guard you met in the kitchen smoking a cigarette as he walks the perimeter.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

You walk up to him. //We&#39;re supposed to be on the same side, right?// &quot;I want to know more about //groundwork.//&quot;

&quot;Fuck if I know. Ask a gardener or some shit.&quot;

&quot;I think you know more than you are letting on,&quot; you insist.

&quot;Oh. What gives you that idea?&quot;

The guard doesn&#39;t seem to be listening. &quot;Has anyone ever told you that you smell just like //lilacs and apple pie?//&quot; he interrupts you.

&quot;Uhh… //No.//&quot; //That was pretty weird.//

&quot;Those are like muh two favorite thangs!&quot; The guard&#39;s disposition changes completely.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Yeah! Sorry, babe what did you wanna know?&quot;

&quot;Tell me about //groundwork.//&quot;

&quot;Well I figure the people who need to know, know, you know?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Would it be weird if I ask if I could smell your hair?&quot;

//WTF!// &quot;Yes! That would be very fucking weird!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I feel kinda //fuzzy.// It&#39;s the--&quot;

&quot;The lilacs and apple pie,&quot; you finish. //Whatever the fuck that means.//

The guard enthusiastically agrees. &quot;It reminds me of home.&quot;

You look closely at the man&#39;s face. His pupils are dilated. He seems oddly unsteady for a guard. He is clearly under the influence of something. //Or someone...?//

Both Drew and Evan were acting extra weird since your transformation.// Am I having some kind of effect on them? All the guys did seem… ah, //dumber// than usual but I thought that was just because of the change in perspective…//

//If he wants to smell my hair...// You work your fingers into your scalp and shake out your hair. 

&quot;Guh…&quot; The guard reacts as if you just punched him in the stomach. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you about Plan Groundwork.&quot;

&quot;So, //Plan Groundwork//… huh?&quot;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2440" name="Craig has substituted //Mega Blazers// for a different fighting game you don’t recognize." tags="" position="4986,19562" size="100,100">“I-I haven’t played this one lately so it is more fair,” Craig quickly explains.

//Why do I doubt that?//

You feel out of your element as you scroll through the fighter selection. Surprisingly, Craig doesn’t wait for you to pick before making his decision, choosing a giant meatball of a warrior who looks like he has muscles on top of his muscles.

//If he’s going big and presumably slow, I will pick someone quicker...// You pick a balanced fighter wearing a mask and wielding a claw weapon.

“The loser will do what the winner says,” Craig tries to change the rules during the countdown. “B-best of five!”

“I didn’t agree to that!” you protest. “Grrr.” //I’m going to crush this twerp!//

You play aggressively and manage to catch Craig off guard. After a brutal back and forth, you win the first match only taking a few hits. //Heh, finally the law of averages wins out. Craig sucks at this game! It feels good to knock him down a peg or two!// Since Craig is, well //Craig//, you don’t feel bad kicking his handicapped ass.

The second match follows the same pattern as the first. A taste of victory only makes you crave more.

“Haha, you can’t beat me!” you tease Craig. Your early victories make you overconfident. “One more win and you are doing exactly what I say.”

Craig gasps. “You changed the rules!?”

“No, I am just going with what you said. You’re not the only one who can change on a whim.”

You head into the third match hungry for a quick win. With a few quick punches and a lucky grab, you start off with a huge lead. Craig’s meatball man is slow to respond to your rapid hit and run.

As you move in for the final blow, [[Craig begins to squeal like a piglet.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2441" name="Craig begins to squeal like a piglet." tags="" position="5102,19605" size="100,100">The noise buys Craig the split second he needs to dodge out of range of your blows.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/craiggamecomeback.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You keep attacking, becoming more aggressive with each missed strike. 

To your absolute horror, the situation reverses as Craig and his meatball man go into full berserk mode.

Your mouth drops open in shock as Craig pulls off an astounding reversal.

//What the heck?! Was that was just luck…?//

Craig clearly demonstrates that he was holding back as he completely crushes you twice more in rapid succession, while barely taking more than a few token hits.

//I… I… lost…?//

You have fallen into Craig’s trap… again.

“Yaaay! I win again! Alright, Tammy. Now that I have beaten you, I want you to kiss my pee-pee!”

You are so angry that you can’t even utter a sound beyond the hiss of a tea kettle going off in your mind. Whether you are more pissed at Craig or yourself is hard to say.

“I am //not-//”

Craig frowns. [[&quot;You prom-ised!&quot; he interrupts.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2442" name="&quot;You prom-ised!&quot; he interrupts." tags="" position="4992,19685" size="100,100">&quot;Craig! Stop acting like a damned kid! There is a limit to these things,” you patiently explain. “If you commanded me to jump off a bridge I wouldn&#39;t do it.&quot;

&quot;You said we’d have fun. This is fun! The //best// fun!”

&quot;Errr... &quot;  //Sorry, I hate breaking my word but this is going way too far… I have to draw the line before it becomes too blurred.// “It’s not happening,” you flatly repeat your refusal.

Craig switches to bargaining. “O-okay, how about I let you off if you do one more thing for me...”

&quot;No way! I have had enough of your bullshit.&quot;

&quot;Then let me touch your boobs for a bit and I’ll be good,” he offers.

//That isn’t much of a compromise...//  

“Is that really so much to a-ask?  I bet it even feels good.  I am doing you a favor. It will be fun!&quot;

You almost laugh at Craig’s mental acrobatics but the circumstances are far too tragic. “Yeah, Craig it is too much.”

“How come? You can touch my chest i-if you want.”

[[“That’s not quite the same thing…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2443" name="Inside a shopping bag is an incredibly sexy dress." tags="" position="3366,16313" size="100,100">You dress up in elegant red. Once you add the clip on hoop earrings and the dress’ choker you stare at yourself in the mirror for fifteen minutes, shocked at how stunning you look. 

The provided heels are just short enough that you can hobble around with minimal awkwardness.

When you can procrastinate no more, you take the last of the “anxiety pills” hopeful it will make the night pass by even faster. To combat the night’s chill, you grab a leather jacket from Julie’s closet.

You make the walk to the Palace, conscious that time is passing by far too quickly. It’s almost like you are walking to your own execution.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddywalk.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

//I’ll just close my eyes and pretend it is someone else. Whew...//

You head to the penthouse and knock while a host of acrobatic butterflies threaten to burst from your stomach. The effects of the “anxiety” pills serve as a distressing distraction.

“Come in,” Teddy calls from inside.

[[You walk into the lion’s den, head held high.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2444" name="You walk into the lion’s den, head held high." tags="" position="3261,16356" size="100,100">Your father is nowhere in sight. The spacious, lavishly furnished penthouse, is otherwise completely empty save for a box wrapped with a black ribbon.

“That’s for you. Open it. I’ll be right there,” your dad calls from the bathroom.

The suspicious box beckons you forth.

“Er…”

You pull the ribbon off with one swift motion, revealing a sexy set of lingerie complete with enough straps and buckles to boggle your mind.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddygiftunwrap.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Inside is a set of black leather lingerie unlike any you have ever seen before. //Very sexy lingerie… Fuck, this is such a weird gift for a father to give to his son...//

//I can’t believe I have to wear something like this...//

Clearly, you are intended to put it on but something about the obvious sexual connotations of the clothing gives you pause.

You gulp in nervousness as your mind plays out the logical chain of events. With rising panic fueling a strange excitement, you glance back at the doorway. //This is my last chance to leave...// If you stay and indulge Teddy any longer then the fate of your maidenhead is sealed. 

[[Try it on|teddy try]]
[[This is too embarrassing! I need to get out of here!]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2445" name="teddy try" tags="" position="3367,16434" size="100,100">You strap and buckle yourself in with a minimal amount of fumbling. The realization that you’ve become somewhat accustomed to female underwear makes you feel queasy.

//And this isn’t just any underwear...//

The bindings are cold against your soft skin.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddydress1.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

As you pull up your stockings, Teddy emerges from the washroom.

He stops dead in his tracks. The two of you lock eyes and you become certain that you have made the wrong decision by coming here in this state.

//Holy fuck...//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddydress2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your father looks at you with such longing that your stomach twists into even tighter knots.

He sits down, drink in hand to admire you.

You awkwardly pose for your sire for a couple of minutes. As you tug at the uncomfortable garment now restricting your chest, it captures Teddy’s attention. His demands suddenly escalate.

[[“Take it off!” Mr. Roux commands.]]

By the time your father steps out of the bathroom, you are already long gone.

With a snap, your bra drops to the ground. Your modest chest drops while your father looks on with unabashed desire.

You’ve been shirtless around your father a few times… but never like this.

[[“You are marvelous!” he compliments you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2448" name="“You are marvelous!” he compliments you." tags="" position="3387,16538" size="100,100">Before you can object, your father crosses the room and kneels down with his hands around your bikini bottom.

He pulls them down, revealing your unbearable wet pussy not six inches from face.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyeat.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

A sweet musky scent approaches your nostrils. //Oh god, is that me!? If I can smell that then…//

“Ahhn!”

Your father chuckles. “I knew it.”

//[[Oh no, he’s definitely going to misunderstand! I’m not enjoying this!]]//

Post orgasm, you’re just //too sensitive// so you try and shift away.

But Teddy won’t let you go. He rises and father looks, son, daughter, whatever the fuck, in the the eyes and you want nothing more than to flee but you stand there in a stunned daze. In your confusion your lips somehow find Teddy’s.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddykiss.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You get swept up in a whirlwind of kisses, each hotter, wetter, and more intimate than the last. //No, no, no, mayday…! Maydaaaay!//

Your father&#39;s lust coupled with his flagrant infidelity, and his passionate embrace leaves your world spinning. //Did he kiss mom like this? Ahh! Don’t think!//

Each second of contact adds fuel to the fire smoldering inside you. //It’s just the pills!// you assure yourself.

Your orgasm makes you compliant. You’ve never been kissed so passionately...

Your shaking hands meet your father’s hard pecs. [[Teddy moves your hand lower and begins to unzip his pants as you cross truly beyond the point of no return.]]

You are shocked and more than a bit envious of your father’s size. 

“Ohh….” //My dad’s cock and balls… This is where I came from? Ahh! Stop thinking, Taylor!//

As Teddy begins to rub your sodden pussy, you can’t help but attempt to mirror his actions.

Your hand moves up and down Teddy’s shaft. The whole moment is like a devilish wet dream.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyjerk.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Make me feel good,” Teddy whispers to you in between kisses.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddysuck.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


“I am so glad you had a change of heart! You are worth every penny… just this for one moment… ahhh….”

You coat your father’s cock with saliva, gently appreciating his big dick with your tongue.

You wrap your lips around his glans and softly suck.

Lewd sucking sounds fill the room. Instead of focusing on your embarrassment, you direct all your attention to the penis in front of you.

“Fahh… Aggh… Guh… Mm…” //Ahh… I’m sucking my dad’s dick...//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddysuck2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Teddy groans with pleasure, oblivious to the fucked up specifics of the act unfolding.

He grabs the back of your head, threading his thick fingers through your hair, and then rams his cock to the back of your throat.

You taste every inch of your sire as he uses you for his own sick pleasure.

When he finally allows you a respite to breathe, [[Teddy grabs your ass and pulls you forward onto his dick.]]

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddythigh.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You are absolutely on fire. You’ve been trying to alternatively focus on and ignore that ever present itch. It is obvious that your horny young body wants to have sex.

//It’s got to be the aphrodisiac...//

[[You don’t know what to do except to follow along and let your father teach you another of life’s lessons.]]

The gooey warmth pooling inside you can be ignored no longer. You awkwardly straddle him, hoping to maintain at least the illusion of control. You see a large dick, your father&#39;s dick, pressing up against your tingling loins. This time the angle is completely different. There is no going back. You watch with one part disbelief and ten parts horror as your dad applies greater pressure and slowly sinks between your wet folds.

“Hnnnghh ahh! Eee...”

//No! Stop it!//  Never in your wildest dreams could you ever imagine having sex with your father.  Yet it is now happening to you.

You slide down onto Teddy’s staff as he thrusts upwards and the two of your bodies meet to become one. And just like that, your virginity has been claimed by your father and an uncrossable line has been leapt over.

As soon as your dad’s hot cock pierces you, you feel your mind go blank. You are surprised that it doesn’t feel as awful as you expected.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyfuck.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The world melts away as Teddy’s big dick begins to move inside you.

//Holy shit, holy shit, HOLY SHIT!// Your body betrays your mind. “This feels… awesome.” You can’t quite believe your own ears.

“It feels just right,” Teddy agrees. “You and I were just made for each other!”

“Hyaa...  Don’t say that...“

“Oh baby…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyfuck3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2455" name="Teddy, ever the gentleman, nods at you." tags="" position="3290,16956" size="100,100">Yet his actions betray his words. As you mewl in protest, your father’s penis plunges even deeper inside you.

//Shlip shlip shlip!//

“That’s noooot sloooow! Ahhhhh!”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyfuck4.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

He continues to pick up speed until you can no longer resist the beckoning white light at the edge of your vision. You clamp down and cum with a penis inside you.

Your father shouldn’t make you feel this way but he does.

“This-is-too-much! Ahhhhhhh! Uhn! Ahhh!”  //I can’t take it anymore!//

As the minutes inexorably tick by, your love making transitions into something more primal…

Your moment of agony transforms into ecstasy as your sex reaches a crescendo.

[[Teddy reshapes your insides and mind in much the same way.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2456" name="Teddy reshapes your insides and mind in much the same way." tags="" position="3400,17011" size="100,100">Your orgasm just makes you even more suggestable. Your mouth floods with saliva. You want nothing more than to add to the sensations building within you.

As you fall forward in a daze, Teddy jams his tongue into your mouth just as you ascend into the most intense orgasm of your life.

Made pliable by your orgasms, you kiss him back, embracing the mad world that brought you here along with its accompanying pleasure.

His touch frightens you yet you are powerless to resist against your father&#39;s strength.  He pins you to the bed and crawls on top of you, eageringly groping your breasts and groin as he does so.

With a grunt of pleasure, your father soon has his entire length buried inside you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyfuck2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your brain seems to switch on and off randomly. A few visceral moments of clarity disgust you. 

//Nooooooo……I am really having sex with my dad!  I just want to fucking die!//

Your father seems unconcerned by your discomfort. With a blissful expression painted across his face, he eagerly pounds away at your tight pussy.

The sound of your sex soon echoes throughout the room and your father&#39;s pace intensifies as he reaches his limit.

&quot;Ohhhhh… I’m going to...!&quot; your father moans as you feel him convulse inside you. //Going to… oh no!// You feel his sperm shoot deep inside you.

After his balls are drained inside you, Teddy rolls off you. 

You wonder what your father would do if he knew he had just fucked his own daughter… //Er...son.//

You feel your dad&#39;s jizz leak out of you.  You feel absolutely wretched and ashamed.  //I just got creampied by my dad...why did I allow this to happen?//  Therapy will never erase this.  //Only a bullet to the head might fix me now...//

“Hwaahh… How was that?” a sweaty Teddy asks you.

[[“Life altering…”]]

I’m not enjoying this!" tags="" position="3272,16596" size="100,100">Teddy grins up at you before he dives into your crotch, his agile tongue probing right down the center of your love petals. He cups your ass cheeks as he plays with you. Somehow, as he kisses and sucks on your clit, your hands find his own. Teddy continues to eat your pussy until you reach the point of no return. Your body doesn’t care about your relationship, only about the pleasant sensation of a skilled, determined tongue working your nether bits. He keep going until your knees nearly buckle. Legs shaking, and hips bucking, the two of you fall to the floor as cum with your father’s tongue inside you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyeat2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Uhhh! Nooo way! Uh!” //Fuck...//

Your father should be the last person you think of as you drive over the edge.

Reconciling the fact that your dad just made you cum is an impossible task.

Your father continues to playfully bite at your flesh as you come down.


 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddyeat3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 


But Teddy refuses to allow you to cool off. The pace of his tongue work increases until the room is filled with wet slopping noises.

You close your eyes and before you know it you are grabbing onto the back of your dad’s head as he pushes you into a new dimension.

Your father is content to lap up all of your love nectar.

[[“Mmmm… I love the way you taste!”]]

Your dad&#39;s words make you turn crimson.

&quot;Wow, you are so cute!  I am definitely going to request you next time! You’ll give me a discount now, right?&quot;

“Nope. I have to go now.”

“Don’t be so shy! What did you think of your first time?”

“Ahhh! I don’t want to talk about this!”

“Wait! Where are you going?”

You run home on wobbling legs while the rational part of your mind berates you for your impulsive actions.

That night you lie awake in bed for a long time.  //I have to change back before it is too late… then maybe, //just maybe// there is a chance I can ward this memory off in the quarantine section of my mind.//

The next day at work, you are assisting in the lounge. While dropping off a tray, you feel a hand on your backside.  Your tight asscheek gets a firm squeeze.

You turn around and are unsurprised to see &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; fucking Roux.  //Wow… here we go again...//

[[You listen to your father’s pitch while displaying as much disinterest as possible.]]

You sigh. “It just isn’t!” Craig’s continuous questions have an uncanny ability to erode your will to protest.

“Your hair is soft! And you’re //purty!//” Craig compliments you.  “When I think about you...or when I look at you ...I uh..I feel good!  And then ...when I go like this,” he begins to furiously rub his crotch, “I feel //sooo// much better.”

//Wow...// Craig has gone off the deep end. &quot;Craig…&quot;

&quot;I have something to show you,&quot; the portly manchild says as he grabs something off his desk.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/celebcouple2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
He presents you with a picture of some stupid celebrity couple.  The pair are holding hands and looking into each other’s eyes lovingly. You’re unsure how to respond. &quot;Aw… that&#39;s nice…?&quot;  You feel really sorry for Craig more than anything else.  He continues to stare adoringly at the photo. [[“You’re just lonely, right? You want some love and attention.”]]  It is hard not to sympathize with Craig.

And this too,” he says while pulling out a ripped page of what appears to be some kind of porno mag from decades earlier. Half the pages are faded, dog-eared, and crusty. He proceeds to wave the pages in front of your face.

&quot;Ew…&quot; Most of the pictures portray hardcore sex, but several are just tasteful nudes. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chc.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I want to try this with you!  Because I //looove// you, Tammy,” Craig continues.

“Whoa---Whoa---hold on!” you protest, suddenly feeling every remaining fine hair on your body stand on end. Your flesh becomes covered with goosebumps.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/chc2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You look at Craig’s demented grin along his uncomprehending and overly intense eyes and feel nothing except a sense of //imminent danger.//

You stand up and move towards the door but Craig’s iron grip stops you short.

“I love you! You can’t go yet!”

“I am sorry, Craig…&quot; 

“You love me!” He shouts as he sweeps you up in a bear hug. “You love me,” he repeats his wish.

//Not exactly! I guess I have to break it to him...RIP manchild emotions.//

[[&quot;Craig, I like you too but…&quot;]]
[[“I am sorry, but I do NOT love you, Craig! Now let me fuckin’ go this instant!”]]

“Oh…”

//I need to distract him somehow!//

“Craig, let’s watch Vidtube instead. But I’m picking the videos this time!”

After minimal arguing, Craig agrees.

You end up watching a compilation of men getting hit in the groin.

&quot;Fuuuck, he got taken out! Oh my god that has to hurt! Why the hell would someone volunteer for this shit?&quot; you snort with laughter at one video.

&quot;Tammy… You swear a lot…&quot; Craig notes before trailing off as he studies your face intently. &quot;Y-you remind me of someone!&quot;

You are suddenly anxious. The fine hair on the back of your neck stands on end. &quot;Eh? Who do I remind you of?&quot; 

&quot;Tammy, do you know //Taylor Roux?//&quot; Craig asks you.

“Ummm…” Craig&#39;s question makes you feel ill.

Of course you attempt to play dumb. [[&quot;I dunno, maybe. Who is that?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2462" name="“I am sorry, but I do NOT love you, Craig! Now let me fuckin’ go this instant!”" tags="" position="5082,19964" size="100,100">“Nooooooooo!” Craig howls.

He refuses to release you, you try and fight him off but his uncommon strength overwhelms you.

“I will tell your mom!” you threaten.

“Noooooooo!” he howls again, looking panicked beyond redemption.  

“God damnit! Let me gooOOoo!!!”

“No, not until you love me!” Craig shouts in your ear.

The next thing you see is Craig’s forehead flying towards you.  You feel a flash of pain as your heads collide. Then you sense only silence.

You flirt with consciousness, as if struggling to wake from a deep slumber.  Eventually, you begin to hear the faint murmur of voices.

“Did Tammy already head home?” Sandra enquires.

You try and scream through the gag but only manage to choke yourself.

The next morning, you listen and try and make noise to alert Sandra of your presence as she prepares for work.  You try and rattle the pipes and cry for help but it is all a futile effort.

After Craig’s mom departs, it doesn’t take long before Craig comes and finds you.

He rips your gag off with a caution for you to “be good.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigbasement.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You mentally shriek in horror as Craig takes you out like a piece of luggage.  He carries you over to a corner of the basement and throws you onto an old workout mat.  

You flip onto your butt. Craig doesn’t seem to mind the change in view.

You look down and see the largest cock you have seen about to penetrate your virgin pussy...Craig’s cock.  A guy who destined to be a genetic dead end, is now about to fuck your potentially fertile little cunt.  //Ah!  It doesn’t matter if I am fertile! I don’t want to have sex with this gross idiot!//

But you don&#39;t have any choice. [[Craig is freakishly strong and holds you down like a vice grip as he slowly, inexorably plows forward into your waiting vagina…]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2463" name="Craig is freakishly strong and holds you down like a vice grip as he slowly, inexorably plows forward into your waiting vagina…" tags="" position="5082,20114" size="100,100">You swat at Craig and he grabs your hands. For a brief time, the two of you grapple but Craig’s size and position quickly win out.

With a desperate shove, you push Craig back and manage to scramble to your feet. As you turn to run, Craig tackles you to the ground. Your face is mashed into the matting while Craig mounts you from behind.

You feel something far too big to be a mere finger press against your soft spot…
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigdoggy.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Before you can do anything more, your butt is pulled towards Craig and you are penetrated to your very core.

“Hnnnnnghhh! Nooo! //Take it out!//”

“After my juice comes out!”

//No fucking way!// “Stoooop!”

“Ahhhh! I wwwuv you, Tammy!” Craig cries as he rapes you. “I will keep you forever!”

“Uuuhn! I’m not your pet!”

Craig ignores your protests, content to revel in the contact of your flesh.

After what feels like an eternity, he bottoms out inside you and blasts a huge load of foul cum into the deepest recesses of your womb.

Craig treats you like his plaything for the rest of the day…

&quot;I don’t swear that much! Eeerrr--” //Oh shit! I just let my real identity slip out!// “I mean, how could anyone swear that much?” you deflect.

Craig looks at you with confusion written across his round face.

Eager to change the subject, you click on another video.

You and Craig laugh at a few random videos.

At one point a man takes a frisbee directly to the temple and drops like a ton of bricks.

“T-that happened to my dad once,” says Craig.

&quot;Oh yeah at that big party with the stupid bounce play house they had setup!&quot;

Craig begins to make strange noises. He tilts his head to the side. &quot;H-h-how d-do you know that?&quot;

&quot;Er… “ //Fuck! Two slip ups back to back! Damnit, I really need to be more careful; Craig is way smarter than he looks!!// “Um - Sophie told me about it!&quot; you lie.

&quot;//Sophie…?//&quot; Craig perks up and then slumps over a few seconds later, as if the name both elates and depresses him at the same time.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

After a few deep breaths, Craig’s eyes narrow as he looks at you. &quot;The Bells took me in that year. I //remember// and I //don&#39;t// remember you!&quot; Craig practically screams.

“Whoa, whoa! Settle down, Craig! Holy shit!”

“You’re t-trying to trick me! You look a lot like… //no!// Who are you, Tammy?!” he shouts.

[[Admit you are Taylor]]
[[Try to convince Craig that he is mistaken]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2465" name="Admit you are Taylor" tags="" position="4938,20714" size="100,100">“Alright! Stop! You’re right, okay? It’s me.”

“Me…?” It takes about thirty seconds for your words to sink in.  //“Taylor?”//

“Yeah…”

“But you’re a girl… A //real// girl! I saw your //special place!//”

“Eww… Yeah…”

You and Craig both fade into silence for several minutes. You can’t help but wonder what’s going through Craig’s twisted mind. Your question is soon answered when begins to laugh.

“Bahahahahah! This is funny!”

“Not really.”

“I-I like you better this way!”

You sigh. “Alright, so the cat’s out of the bag! But now you understand why what we did was wrong, right?”

The portly young man shakes his head. “I w-want to see your panties!”

You blink several times. “WHAT!? Weren’t you listening to me!?” you snap.

“You hid your name from my par-ents.”

“Um.”

“Aaaaand you lost!”

“So?”

[[“So now I get what I want!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2466" name="Try to convince Craig that he is mistaken" tags="" position="5047,20264" size="100,100">You can’t blow your cover! Craig may use it to blackmail you!

“Craig, I am NOT whoever you think I am, okay?”


Current EoC :**(
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2467" name="“So now I get what I want!”" tags="" position="4938,20864" size="100,100">Your heart falls. “Craig, no, I think you’re confused.”

“I’m not confused! You owe me. I won. I know y-your name and lots more. We did so much together… I think all of this is the u-ni-verse paying me back for my life. You’re special, Taylor. I’ll keep your secrets but you need to honor our deal. I want to see your boobs now!”

//You’ve got to be fuckin’ kidding me!// You had hoped revealing your identity would help your position, not ruin it entirely.

You are about to protest but one look into Craig’s eyes dissuades you. There is something cold and out of place there.

Craig’s childlike venere has worn off.

“Fine, you fucking asshole!” you relent. You pull your top over your head and give Craig what he wants.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytopless5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Good! Now show me your panties!”

“Fffffrrr….” You want to smack Craig but can’t muster up the will to set off such a cascade of potential consequences. Instead of slapping him, you take off your pants.

Craig is on you in a flash. [[“I need to see better!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2468" name="“I need to see better!”" tags="" position="4938,21014" size="100,100">“No you don’t! Hyyaahh!” You tumble onto the bed in the confusion with Craig hot on your tail. 

Before you can stop him, Craig moves his face close to your panty clad groin. The proximity makes you deeply uncomfortable. Craig inhales deeply, drawing your attention to an odd smell. //What&#39;s that musky odor…? Is that //me//!?//

“OOOOoooohhh! I like this! You smell //really good// down here, Taylor! This is sign of exc-ex-ex-excitement!”

“Ahh… No touching!&quot; you warn him.

&quot;H-how can I not?&quot;

Craig immediately lunges for your boobs.

&quot;Hyaahhh!&quot; you cry out as his hands tightly grasp and squeeze your breasts.

Craig begins to pull down your panties.

You try and resist but find Craig to be far too big to dislodge.

Before you know it, [[you are exposed before the devious manchild.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2469" name="you are exposed before the devious manchild." tags="" position="4938,21164" size="100,100">“Smile!” Craig orders. There is an edge to his voice that brooks no interference.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigexposed.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You put on a forced smile for your chubby overlord.

“Hefehehefahah!” Craig laughs as he puts one hand on your thigh.

&quot;//Craig!!//&quot; you shriek. &quot;Fucking stop it right now!&quot;

Craig ignores you, lurching forward with outstretched hands. &quot;Ohhh your skin is so soft!&quot; he shouts with glee.

The chubby young man then begins to //snort//, reminding you of a pig about to dive into a loaded trough.

“S-pread it. Your p-pussy! I want to see more! Show me! Show me!”

[[You’ve already gone so far that you spread your pussy with minimal urging.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2470" name="You’ve already gone so far that you spread your pussy with minimal urging." tags="" position="4938,21314" size="100,100">//Ahh shit! I don’t want to obey Craig… but what else can I do?//

You spread your pussy petals for Craig. The young man watches on, transfixed.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigspread.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ahh….&quot; //I am showing my most intimate places to Craig...// You are certain Craig has now received a better view of your new parts than you have.

“Smile!”

“Tch. Fine! [[You want me to look happy while I’m dying on the inside? That’s just great!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2471" name="&quot;There&#39;s a weird button on top,&quot;" tags="" position="4941,21504" size="100,100">&quot;That&#39;s my… clitoris…&quot; //My clitoris… Wow...//

You realize far too late that you have crossed the point of no return.

//I need to distract him somehow! Geez, how much longer is it until Sandra gets back!?//

“Uh… Hey, Craig. How about you look at my boobs instead?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigtoofartease.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Okkaaay!”

“No touching!”

“Okay.”

“Huh?”

//Snap.//

Craig, cell phone in hand, has just taken a picture of you.

“Craig! What the fuck!?”

“You said no touching.”

“Delete those.”

“Maybe if I can touch you a little bit.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Then you do it first.&quot;

&quot;You want me to touch myself?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

//[[I guess that’s better than him touching me… I&#39;ve never masturbated in front of someone before.]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2472" name="You want me to look happy while I’m dying on the inside? That’s just great!”" tags="" position="4938,21394" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigspread2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I just want to see more. You’re so puuurty!”

It is surprisingly easy to put yourself in Craig&#39;s shoes and you find it difficult to condemn his desire. Yet his attitude and attempts to blackmail you piss you off immensely.

//But that still doesn&#39;t explain why the fuck I am doing this...//

&quot;It is so purdy… It is like a //love flower//… wow! //Please// show me more, Taylor! I //need// to see more!&quot;

Perhaps you are just as curious about your new body as Craig is. //But why does Craig get to see…?//

[[&quot;There&#39;s a weird button on top,&quot;]] he observes.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2473" name="//I guess that’s better than him touching me… I&#39;ve never masturbated in front of someone before.//" tags="" position="4938,21544" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2474" name="“Then show me more! Show me your bum!”" tags="" position="4948,21794" size="100,100">“Grrr…”

You bend over, feeling like a total fool. //How the fuck do I get myself into these situations!?// you rage.

&quot;Spread your bum cheeks please,&quot; Craig requests.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigshowbutthole.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Raaahhhh!”

Even though it is just the two of you, you feel more embarrassed than you ever have before in your life.

Flushing with shame, you lean forward even further and spread open you ass for Craig’s education.

“Coool!” 

//Splunnk!//

Unable to stop him, Craig plunges what you hope is only a finger deep into your asshole.

You clench up but it doesn&#39;t stop Craig&#39;s advance.

&quot;Hnnnunnnghh! I said no touching!!&quot;

“Sorry…”

//Fuck I can&#39;t believe I let that creep put his fingers inside me…//

Craig&#39;s flesh has been inside all three of your holes, a fact that bothers the hell out of you. //At least he hasn&#39;t fucked me...// The thought is small consolation. //I have to avoid that possibility at all costs or I will throw myself off a freaking bridge the first chance I get!//

When you turn around to castigate Craig, you find that his pants are around his ankles. A [[massive erection, like a third leg, stands at full attention.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2475" name="massive erection, like a third leg, stands at full attention." tags="" position="4938,21914" size="100,100">“I n-need your help, Taylor! I, uh, want, //need// to have a blow-job!” Craig announces, his voice cracking mid sentence.

You grind your teeth angrily.  

“Grrr…&quot; //Am I really going to do this again?//

“Please!”

//Holy fuck this is so humiliating...//

“I won, remember?” Craig reminds you.

//I am supposed to be teaching and watching him… I think I am teaching him the wrong things...//

Before you can finish your internal argument, Craig  grabs your head and forces you down onto his putrid dick.

You pull away but your hand, meant to ward Craig off, touches his penis. Before you can snatch it back, he grabs your hand within his own and begins to use your palm to pleasure himself.

//I can&#39;t believe I have to touch this gross thing… // Even using only your hands, you feel certain you will require a lot of bleach, soap, and therapy to make this right.

You know what Craig wants. //The question is am I going to do it?// Craig’s penis slides against your palm. //Fuck, this thing is so damned big… I can feel Craig’s pulse-- Ahh!// &quot;This is our secret, got it?&quot;

“Kiiiisssss it!”

//Ew, now my lips are going to touch him…// You would never willingly kiss Craig… but now you are about to do something very similar... to a place even more distasteful than Craig&#39;s lips.

&quot;Do it like the internet pictures!&quot; Craig urges you.

His cock rubs against your cheek and pops into your mouth. &quot;Mwah!&quot;

//Holy shit! This thing is almost bigger than my forearm! Was he like this yesterday!?//

[[For the second time in as many days, you are sucking on Craig’s penis.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2476" name="For the second time in as many days, you are sucking on Craig’s penis." tags="" position="4938,22064" size="100,100">“Yaaay!”

“Mggfahh…!”

//This is another low moment of my life… I will never be able to live this down!//

Craig&#39;s enormous cock swells even larger as you lick the underside of his bulky shaft.

You give the tip of the penis a tentative lick and are greeted with a bitter, salty tang. When your tongue touches Craig&#39;s tiny slit at the end of his cock, you feel an inadvertent twinge in your own genitals. The subtle tingle reminds you a bit of how it once felt to get an erection.

//Wait! That&#39;s not right! There is no way this is turning me on!//

“Uhhhhh!  Taylor Roux is licking my cock!” Craig autistically narrates your actions.  &quot;Your mouth feels so warm and wet…&quot;   //Ugh...I really wish he would shut up...//

You only see one way to do that now.  You suddenly cover Craig&#39;s cockhead with your mouth and roll your tongue over his glans.

Aside from a sharp intake of breath and a moan, he goes silent.  Soon only the lewd sounds of you sucking Craig’s dick are the only audible noise in the room.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cuminmoutha.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With no warning Craig cums like a fountain, spraying the inside of your mouth with foul, bitter liquid. There is so much spunk that it overflows everywhere and lubricates your movements as you continue to stroke him during the final moments of his climax.

Craig looks down at you with pure contentment as he continues to ejaculate into your mouth.

“Fuah! Puuhh!” You spit out Craig’s semen.

As you wipe yourself down with a box of tissues, you notice Craig has again taken his phone out.

//Fuck, how many pictures of me has he taken?// You are defeated and depressed.

[[“Taylor, you are really c-cool,”]] Craig compliments you. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2477" name="“Taylor, you are really c-cool,”" tags="" position="4938,22214" size="100,100">“Kch…” You ignore Craig, while continuing to wipe away semen. The gross stuff has gone everywhere, concentrating in the spaces between your fingers.

“Did my mom talk to you about next week?” Craig asks you.

You sigh. “What about next week?”

“You have to say yes!”

“To what?”

“You have to say yes!” he repeats, much more forcefully. “Or I will tell everyone!”

“Don’t threaten me! I have no idea what the hell you’re talking about!” You storm off to the washroom to fix your clothes and wash up.

Once you finish, you notice that the hour is late. You resolve to wait out the clock in the kitchen.

Amazingly, Craig leaves you alone. Sandra arrives half an hour later.

After a brief exchange of small talk, Sandra cuts to the chase. &quot;I have a //big// favour to ask you.&quot; 

&quot;Let me guess: you want me to look after Craig again?&quot; you guess.

&quot;Am I that transparent? Yes, but I might need you to watch him for longer than usual.  The truth is: something serious has come up.  It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for my husband and I.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

[[&quot;We won a cruise for two weeks in the Carribean!&quot;]] Sandra announces.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2478" name="&quot;We won a cruise for two weeks in the Carribean!&quot;" tags="" position="4938,22364" size="100,100">Your jaw drops. &quot;//Two weeks!?//&quot;

&quot;It sounds way longer than it is and it isn&#39;t for a little while.  Besides Craig is grown up… //mostly.//  He doesn&#39;t need constant supervision or for you to be there waiting on him hand and foot.  Go to class.  Do whatever.  Just be there for him and help him out a bit with the basic tasks he seems to have so much trouble with.  You&#39;re a good girl, Tammy.  I know you have a big heart.  Will you help me?” 

&quot;Two weeks is a long time…&quot;  You find it increasingly difficult to refuse the offer after receiving Sandra&#39;s compliments.

“Once we get back, I promise my batteries will be recharged!&quot; she goes on. &quot;This could be a big opportunity for you too as well. I have always dreamed of going to the Carribean! We only have two tickets and it has been //years// since we had a vacation.  Jake and I are both exceptionally busy with our careers and we rarely get to coordinate… and then there is Craig… as you know, he can be a bit difficult sometimes…&quot; Mrs. Bell admits.  &quot;So we have to do it. Here’s the deal: look after him for us while we are gone and I will give you one thousand dollars a week plus a big spread of food and a shopping allowance. Is this something you might be interested in? We would be incredibly grateful...” Sandra waves her long eyelashes at you.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; The hesitation in your voice is plain. //The money would be nice but I can&#39;t get too distracted here! Spending all this time with Craig means he is going to rub off on me... maybe literally.// 

“I will tell you what...Tammy, I know you’re a smart girl. Taylor really bragged you up and you&#39;ve already proven yourself to be great with Craig. The truth is Craig did not do that well on his entrance exams and he is taking some courses to catch up... Maybe you could help use this time to help him prep for his final exams at the end of the month. Watch him, tutor him, and keep him out of trouble and I will make sure you are very well compensated. We need you, Tammy! You&#39;ve given us a glimpse of our lives back. I&#39;ll even sweeten the pot: there’s an extra two grand in it for you if he passes his finals. Who knows, there might even be a full time job in it for you...”

Sandra explains that Craig only needs assistance in subjects you are fairly confident in.

You consider Sandra&#39;s offer. Craig is most likely to be a difficult student but you are sure he is intelligent enough to grasp the concepts, if given the proper motivation.

//Proper motivation…? Ew...//

Yet the thought of spending the better part of two weeks with Craig is enough to send your mind into somersaults.

“Please-please-please-please!” Sandra begs you.

“I’ll think about it.”

“That’s all I ask!”

//How hard could it be?//

[[You use the long walk home to clear your head.]]

And especially not a guy like Craig…//

&quot;Oh shit…&quot; You try to pretend that Craig isn’t next to you but his heavy breathing and constant comments make that impossible.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigmast.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;It is //so wet!//  It-it&#39;s //glistening!// I read on the internet that means you love me!&quot;

You shake your head. &quot;No, that&#39;s not right… I don&#39;t like… //this//!&quot; You almost said //you//. You know it is best to treat Craig delicately, lest you provoke a reaction that you may regret.

“That was cool! I want to touch you now!”

“No!”

[[“Then show me more! Show me your bum!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2480" name="at least during your moment of passion." tags="" position="2687,22911" size="100,100">//I can’t believe I am getting fucked up the ass...//

It is hard to enjoy the dull pleasure of your anal penetration when you are perpetually nagged by your conscience.

//This is just lust… right? But then why does doing this kind of stuff with Evan make me feel so … confused?// 

“Ahh… Ah. Ah!” you cry.

//Fwap. Fap-fap-fap. Slooop!//

“Guaah!” Evan grunts as he crams as much of his dick inside you as possible. You feel him touch against your deepest recesses. 

“Hnnngggh…” A part of you knows that you will never recover from this.

“Ugh. Fuck! Taylor, I can’t take it anymore!”

After a frantic barrage of thrusts Evan withdraws and fills the crack of your butt with his hot semen. Although you it surprises you, your relief and shame mingles into an explosive combination with enough percussive force to make you cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/evangetreal.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You twitch and shudder along with Evan.

[[“It’s good to know you like taking it up the bum too!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2481" name="“It’s good to know you like taking it up the bum too!”" tags="" position="2560,22997" size="100,100">“Oh my god, please shut up, Evan… But I guess it is better on my ass cheeks than inside me...” you reflect while hesitantly poking at the sticky pool of reproductive fluid.

“I can fill you up again if you want,” Evan offers.

“Eww… There’s so much!” The volume of Evan’s ejaculate shocks you and turns you on. “I am surprised you have anything left after that…”

“I will always produce more for you!” Evan assures you.

“That’s disgusting.”

“So is //everything// if you really analyze it enough. We’re all weird horny ape people made of water.”

“Speak for yourself!”

“Hey, I didn’t mean anything by it. You’re the prettiest ape lady I’ve ever seen.”

You roll your eyes. Evan has again left you at a loss for words. 

“You’re such an idiot… and so am I.”

You and Evan seem made for each other. //We are both hopeless gluttons for pleasure…//

You fight back a yawn. Exhausted from your sex, you pass out next to Evan.

A few hours pass by before you slowly regain consciousness and the fog clouding your mind dissipates. 

You&#39;re lying in bed on your stomach. A soreness makes itself known. [[Down there. Back there.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2482" name="Down there. Back there." tags="" position="2674,23027" size="100,100">“Owwwie…”

The events of the last night flash through your mind. You groan inwardly as your hand slowly drifts down towards your ass, not quite seeking out the soreness. For some unknown reason you actually let Evan sodomize you. //Repeatedly… Ow...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/sleeping.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your anus, unused to such abuse, is now puckered and sore.

Thinking back, you realize you drifted off into sleep after your last bout. Not even taking a shower, or washing up.

“Ewwww! That’s so gross!”

//If your best friend fills your ass with cum and you fall asleep on your stomach, where does it go?// you wonder with a cringe.

“I hope it just evaporated or something…”

[[You look to the other side of the bed.]]

Evan’s lazy, confident, ever-present smile makes you pretty sure you can guess his thoughts.

//Fucking perv.//

&quot;Morning, pumpkin,&quot; Evan says, as if he doesn’t have a care in the world.

//Pumpkin?!//

&quot;You look so peaceful when you sleep,&quot; he adds. As your mind wavers between smacking him for being an idiot or letting him know just where he can shove his sappy romantic crap, your body decides that the appropriate response is to tease him back with a shy smile.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/shysmile.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After your duel of smiles comes to an end, Evan continues, &quot;You were awake for a bit before you opened your eyes. I could see it on your face.&quot;

//Jesus H. Christ. If the next thing that comes out of his mouth isn&#39;t about motorcycles or sports, I&#39;m definitely smacking him.//

&quot;What were you dreaming about?&quot; he presses. “Were you having a wet dream?”

You manage an &quot;Uh?&quot; as you grasp for an answer that does not involve your sore ass.

Evan continues his inquiry, with an accuracy worthy of an expert marksman, &quot;Was I in it?&quot; he wonders.

//Yick! Dead on...//

&quot;I was just dreaming about, uhm, [[school?]]&quot; you venture.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2484" name="school?" tags="" position="2675,23140" size="100,100">Evan doesn’t seem to notice your obvious lie. &quot;Mmmm, what a waste,” Evan murmurs as he leans in for a morning kiss.

You see it coming and instinctively purse your lips as you turn aside, letting Evan give you a peck that lands somewhere between your upper lip and small, upturned nose.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/avoidedkiss.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Evan withdraws, looking hurt that you&#39;d do such a thing.

&quot;Morning breath!&quot; you declare.

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Evan answers, the emotions playing over your friend&#39;s face as he manages to go from hurt, to abashed, and on to relieved within the span of a few heartbeats.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t wha...&quot; you begin to speak but your voice trails off as you finish the sentence in your head.

//That wasn&#39;t what I meant. I was concerned about my own morning breath. Why the fuck am I worrying about my morning breath? What&#39;s next, anxiety attacks about mismatched socks?//

You decide to change the topic, [[&quot;So why was it a waste?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2485" name="&quot;So why was it a waste?&quot;" tags="" position="2565,23227" size="100,100">Evan&#39;s confusion is written all over his handsome mug. You never really realized how expressive his face can be... 

&quot;Duh! Taylor, it&#39;s Saturday,” Evan patiently explains. “This is the last day you should be preoccupied with studying.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; You weren&#39;t really thinking about school anyway.

&quot;How about a beach trip or a picnic?&quot; Evan suggests.

&quot;What?&quot; //Is he being serious?// You really should spend the day on research if you&#39;re ever going to get your life and real body back to its proper state. 

&quot;I am taking you to the beach, or I&#39;m taking you on a picnic.” Evan rubs his chin to ponder about it for a moment. &quot;Or we could, like, picnic at the beach I guess.&quot;

You feel like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car. &quot;Evan, I really should research, and, you know scour the city for a cure… What would we even do anyway? I don’t have time to sit in a field sniffing daisies with you.&quot;

“Of course you do. What you do with your life is your choice.”

You sigh as you battle off a succession of rogue thoughts. A picnic? Hand in hand with Evan in some park? How fucking gay would that be? But a public beach, in front of a big crowd of people, in... a... fucking... bikini?

//That’s even worse!//

“Oh man…”

A part of you wants to rebel. To tell Evan that this girlfriend thing was a mistake. Another part of you already knows you&#39;re going to spend the day with Evan, either at the beach or at a picnic. 

//Ahh for fuck’s sake! Why is that even a bad thing? I guess there is no reason I can’t have some fun and do a bit of investigating too. I can still dedicate the evening to research, so I’m in good shape! It might even be more effective to spend the day relaxing first...// 

You reason yourself into spending the day with your strictly temporary boyfriend.

&quot;Ah, damn it all to hell...&quot;

Evan begins to pack a bag. Eventually, he looks at you with puppy dog eyes.

[[Tell Evan you need to do some actual research for a change.]]
[[&quot;Let&#39;s head to the beach I guess.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2486" name="Tell Evan you need to do some actual research for a change." tags="" position="2856,23345" size="100,100">Evan is clearly disappointed. “It’s okay, I understand.” Evan makes no sign of leaving. “I could always help!” he offers.

“Yeah, I’m sure you’d “help” all right…”

Your night of research ends in predictable fashion. You try and tell yourself that you are merely performing additional “research” on female anatomy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayevandaily.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your moments with Evan have changed you. You love having sex and that desire is gradually starting to rub off on the man that you spend so much of your time with.

//Damnit… It’s all because of this body! This lovely, sexy, cursed body…//

It is hard to deny that you are increasingly comfortable in your own skin.

//My own skin!? Frick… I guess this is my body even if it is a bit different now...//

Your nights of carnal satisfaction continue. Your willingness to please Evan increases. [[Evan makes you try on a variety of outfits…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2487" name="&quot;Let&#39;s head to the beach I guess.&quot;" tags="" position="2640,23377" size="100,100">“Great! All you need is a sexy swimsuit and we are good to go.”

//I knew he&#39;d say that!// “I don’t know, Evan…”

“We could always go to a nude beach,” he suggests.

“Hah.”

“Don’t worry. It will be fun. You don’t even have to think about it as a date if you don’t want to.”

“But I don’t have a swimsuit.”

“Borrow one from Julie.”

“I guess I could… she does seem to have an overabundance of clothes. I bet she has a dozen swimsuits… How ridiculous is that, you can only wear one a time!”

Julie isn&#39;t at home so you go through her closet to try and find some clothes and a bikini. Why does she have a much larger room than you anyway?

You put thoughts of your domineering sister behind you as you search through Julie’s ample wardrobe.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/closet.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You rummage through the drawers and racks.

You knew Julie had an insane amount of clothes but up close, seeing the boxes, drawers, shelves, and racks of the stuff it all strikes you as the behavior of a borderline hoarder. //It’s like she has an outfit for every day of the year...// By comparison, your wardrobe with five pairs of jeans and a smattering of T shirts looks very modest.

You find a few different bikinis that are not overly slutty… you note Julie has more than a few in that category. Several are made from such a tiny amount of fabric that you doubt it would even hide your nipples.

You pick out three different swim suits.

//Decisions, decisions… Just not the kind I am used to be making.// 

Since Julie owns little else, all three of the choices are rather sexy. //Maybe too sexy… oh well, I guess Evan would appreciate any choice I make.// 

[[Take a pink strapped two piece bikini with colorful stripes]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2488" name="Take a pink strapped two piece bikini with colorful stripes" tags="" position="2490,23527" size="100,100">With a swimsuit attained, you pack a few more items like sunscreen and a towel before meeting Evan.

“Alright, let’s head to the beach…”

After a short ride in Evan’s car, you come to the coast.

The fresh salty sea air invigorates you. 

You walk around at the waterline with your feet in the water, enjoying the sun.  Everything is great until you step on a seashell.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bikini-striped1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan is even remarkably well behaved.

“Let&#39;s go skinny dipping!&quot; Evan suggests.

//Until now I guess...//

You flash Evan a stern look, hopeful that he realizes that you&#39;re questioning his sanity.

“You’re so cute!”

“I’m not cute. I’m //angry!//”

Evan rolls his eyes. As much as I love that bikini, wouldn’t it be a bit more comfortable without it?”

“No way!” //We just got here and Evan is already pestering me... I guess I should be expecting this.//

[[“But it will give you tan lines.”]]

 You feel like this one piece bikini is still very revealing despite its additional fabric.

You burn up under a haze of embarrassment as Evan reacts in predictable fashion.

[[“Wow… You are such a mega babe, Taylor!”]]

You calmly array the facts available in a mental timeline. 

&quot;This doesn&#39;t add up! Let&#39;s just play this out. So you&#39;re trying to say that you&#39;re //me//. So //I// transformed into a chick did a bunch of crazy shit and then came back here to stop myself like the plot of a shitty time traveling movie?&quot;

Taylor nods. &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;

//I knew this chick is lying!// &quot;I have watched sci-fi shows before! If your lame-ass story is true, then you just prevented the creation of yourself! So you don&#39;t even exist! Hah! You&#39;re obviously full of shit.&quot; 

The young woman blinks rapidly. &quot;W-wha!? I don&#39;t exist? I never thought about that…&quot; she remarks. &quot;Well fuck.&quot; Taylor sits down with a sigh. &quot;I nearly killed myself…? Damn, I wasn&#39;t thinking.&quot;

You roll your eyes. &quot;If you were really me, you&#39;d already know what I know so you wouldn&#39;t have even tried this time travel bullshit in the first place! You&#39;re either an improv artist or fucking liar!&quot;

&quot;N-no… I just //forgot,// alright!? I&#39;ve had a lot on my mind, you dick! And it wasn&#39;t like I had much choice. I&#39;m //fucking desperate here!// You have no idea the //cattle ranch level// of bullshit I had to endure to get to this point. If it was as easy as just resetting all this like a fucking game, I would have done it already! You&#39;re the one living in blissful ignorance here, not me! Gaah!&quot; the young woman huffs in frustration before continuing, &quot;I didn&#39;t come to stop my transformation and break the loop - I came here to stop those //motherfuckers.// &quot;

You feel like the crazy level just got turned up to 11. &quot;Uh? Motherfuckers?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, //those fuckin&#39; eyeball guys//… they are everywhere! And the few places they don&#39;t control yet they will in short order unless you get your shit together. Their cronies are definitely snooping around. By this point in time, they are already well positioned but I think they can still be stopped as long as we act before Christmas.

&quot;Ahgg! For fuck&#39;s sake! Why are you being so obtuse?&quot;

&quot;Hey! Anybody would be skeptical. Do you have any proof?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need any! Obviously we look the same. You&#39;re me. Now fuckin&#39; deal with it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s your proof?! We don&#39;t even look alike!&quot; you protest.

&quot;We look //exactly alike,// you fucking idiot!&quot; Taylor argues. &quot;You even said so earlier!&quot;

&quot;No way! I don&#39;t see the resemblance!&quot; you protest a bit too shrilly for your liking. &quot;And you&#39;re a girl...&quot;

Your female alter ego sighs. &quot;Maybe I didn&#39;t go back in time but actually split into a parallel universe with a much more stupid version of myself!&quot; she grumbles.

&quot;Then why come to me?&quot;

&quot;Because I need your help, asshole! I am going to set this shit right.&quot; Taylor doesn&#39;t even look directly at you. She seems consumed in her own internal monologue. Her pretty brown eyes sparkle with emotion. &quot;I will fix my mistakes,&quot; Taylor almost sobs. &quot;And I am going to save everyone I can!&quot; she declares. &quot;And I&#39;ll make those fuckers pay,&quot; she adds ominously.

//I think this chick has been reading too many mangas or something… Those Japanese comics can do weird things to people&#39;s minds!//

This woman&#39;s story is unlikely to be true. //She&#39;s either a master prankster or an escaped mental patient!// you predict. //Or on drugs...//

The chick is obviously joking but she&#39;s super hot so you decide to play along. You&#39;ve always appreciated a good sense of humor. &quot;I believe you.&quot;

Taylor raises an eyebrow. &quot;I honestly I thought- you&#39;d be a little bit more skeptical.&quot;

&quot;Your time travel story or whatever was super believable,&quot; you say somewhat sarcastically.

The young woman takes your words at face value.

&quot;So you&#39;ll help me?&quot;

&quot;Why the fuck not?&quot;

&quot;Great. I know you&#39;re not a bad guy, cuz you&#39;re me. You&#39;re the only guy who can help me.&quot;

&quot;Okay… What do you want me to do?&quot;

Girl Taylor squints at the sun&#39;s high position in the sky. &quot;We&#39;ll talk later. I have an uh, //appointment// I need to keep. Meet me back here at 7 pm, okay? Don&#39;t be late.&quot;

The next thing you know, the woman is dressed and gone. //Wow, way to go Taylor. Instead of fucking the beautiful, willing, naked woman that was in front of you, you tried to //reason// with her.//

&quot;I am a fucking idiot,&quot; you reflect. But maybe you can get another chance if you are patient.

You head home to lament your lost opportunity and console yourself with a bowl of extra sodium enriched ramen.

You keep thinking about the strange woman from the park. You find yourself repeatedly checking the time on your phone as the hour of your meeting approaches.

&quot;What am I doing? She did seem kind of fun. And hot! And I don&#39;t have anything better to do… Fuck it, I&#39;m going!&quot;

As you near the park, a familiar blotch of reddish hair captures your attention. You stop dead in your tracks.

&quot;Is that…?&quot;

It is definitely your most fantasized about crush, Samantha.

//What is &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Samantha&quot; &quot;Sam desc&quot;&gt;&gt; doing all alone in the park?//

The stunning young woman is sitting straight backed on a park bench. //That&#39;s odd… She looks kind of uncomfortable.// Something about Samantha&#39;s posture and presence seems out of place, although you can&#39;t //quite// put your finger on it from this distance.

You check your phone. It is almost 5pm and you will have to hurry if you want to make your meeting with Trickster Taylor on time.

&quot;You can&#39;t go! I haven&#39;t even finished explaining all this shi--&quot;

With butterflies dancing in your stomach, you jog up to her.

&quot;Sam?&quot;

&quot;Taylor!&quot; Sam greets you without making eye contact.

Sam&#39;s presence summons a familiar feeling of discomfort. The woman of your dreams stands so close you could touch her… if you had the stones.

&quot;Sam! What are you doing out here?&quot; It is beginning to get cool outside and Sam, in her light blue dress, might catch a cold if she isn&#39;t careful. 

&quot;I was waiting for you actually,&quot; she answers.

//What!?// That was an unexpected but very welcome answer. &quot;Uhh… //Really?// You were?&quot;

&quot;Yep! Are you alright, Taylor?&quot; Sam wonders, her voice dripping with concern. She turns her head sideways and [[looks at you with bright green eyes.]]

&quot;I&#39;m fi--ne,&quot; you stammer as your relief and excitement transforms into complete terror. Your mouth becomes drier than a desert in the span of a second. //Green eyes…? Green eyes!? Sam doesn&#39;t have green eyes!// Your gut instinct is that Sam is far too pure for colored contact lenses. Sam is such a natural beauty that she doesn&#39;t even need makeup. You&#39;ve fantasized about Samantha more than anyone else and through the experience of your unceasing adoration, you are absolutely certain that the person standing before you isn&#39;t the woman of your dreams. That realization scares you to your very core.

&quot;Who are you!?&quot; you shriek as you push the imposter away.

&quot;Taylor! What has gotten into you? It&#39;s me, Samantha!&quot; the doppelganger insists. Sam&#39;s confused face stares back at you, tugging at your very soul strings. Somehow you manage to maintain a facade of composure despite the fact that your heart is beating so rapidly that it is threatening to leap from your chest and not in the usual way that Sam&#39;s presence inspires. 

&quot;No, no…&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

The imposter&#39;s act would almost be convincing if not for the bitter expression that seems utterly foreign upon Samantha&#39;s normally serene face. The imitator&#39;s scowl deepens, her mouth twisting with malice-tinged annoyance, until it looks to you like Samantha&#39;s body has been possessed by a very real demon. For a moment, Samantha the Angel looks utterly //evil//.

//This isn&#39;t fucking happening!// Your mind attempts to conjure any possible explanation for what you are seeing to rationalize away your terror. It isn&#39;t Halloween. There are no cameras in sight. Your panic intensifies with every second until you feel like you are going to have an anxiety attack. 

&quot;Calm down, Taylor!&quot; the woman tries to comfort you, as if //you&#39;re// the crazy one in this situation.

You stumble backwards, away from the unfolding nightmare before you. &quot;Fuck you! You&#39;re not Sam!&quot; you shriek.

You both fade into silence. 

With a petulant laugh, the doppelganger drops the facade. &quot;Pf! What gave it away?&quot; she asks you in a husky woman&#39;s voice - definitely not belonging to Samantha.

[[&quot;Your e-eyes!&quot;]] you stammer, terrified.

&quot;I have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking about! Who- //what// are you!?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re coming with me, Taylor!// I neeeed you!//&quot; the imposter growls. 

You slap the woman&#39;s hands away. &quot;Get away from me, you frickin&#39; ghoul!&quot; you shout.

Sam&#39;s slender yet unnaturally strong hands wrap around your throat and squeeze down like a boa constrictor. &quot;Where is Anna!?&quot; she shouts her question at you.

The monster releases her grip and allows you to breathe. &quot;W-who is Anna!?&quot; you gasp.

&quot;//Anomaly One!// Don&#39;t play dumb! I know you already made contact. Where is she!?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know anything! Guhh!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot; The next instant your world goes dark as the woman wearing Sam&#39;s skin knees you in the balls so hard you nearly pass out.

The woman with Samantha&#39;s body slugs you in the gut. Despite her delicate features, it feels like you are hit with a steel bat. You crumple to the ground with dark spots floating through your vision. &quot;Guuughh blaah… Fuu--&quot;

The dark spots gradually coalesce until they become all encompassing.

The next time you open your eyes, you are bound to a chair in an interrogation room.

“Did you just loot Julie’s room?”

“Yeah, but I think she has enough clothes that she will survive.”

You swallow nervously as your eyes ghost over Taylor’s tight midriff and the cute milky thighs protruding from Julie’s overly tight jean shorts.

You feel a growing tightness in your own pants. //I&#39;ve got to think about something else...!//

“Okay, I think its time you come clean and tell me what the hell is going on.” You issue an ultimatum.

“You’re going to get naked right here?”

“If you join me. What’s the big deal anyway? Air and sun is good for the skin.” Evan is a bit too eager to show off his weiner in public. “It’s //natural!//” he insists.

//More like unnatural… Evan always has a dumb answer for everything...//

[[You agree but insist that you both go to a less populated part of the beach.]]
[[You look at all the people and realize that you feel a bit excited.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2503" name="You agree but insist that you both go to a less populated part of the beach." tags="" position="2415,23827" size="100,100">You follow Evan to the edge of the beach where the white sand meets black rock jutting up from the sea.

Evan offers you his hand and you let him pull you up.

Hand in hand, you walk along the rocky coast, angling for a patch of light colored sand in the distance.

Evan grins at you while he eyes you from head to toe, silently asking you to strip.

“Someone still might see us out here.”

“So? You’ve got no reason to be shy. You’re hot… and I have already seen you naked… a lot. It’s not a big deal. See?” Evan pulls down his shorts to demonstrate.

You find it difficult to follow suit. Showing off your new body comes with consequences that didn’t exist before your transformation.

You walk beside Evan doing your best not to look at his dangling weiner. Eventually you find the most perfect secluded beach.

Once you are suitably hidden in your private paradise, you decide to follow Evan’s example.

With a pull on the string, your bikini falls to the ground, dropping with the same speed as Evan’s jaw.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/nudebeach1.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Evan chases you to the beach.

You swim, teasing and laughing with Evan until you forget everything else.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/toplessbeach.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Eventually the sun starts to decline. Apparently time flies when you are having fun.

[[“Let’s get out of the water before I turn into a prune.”]]

However you take your time…

 Eager to shield yourself from prying eyes, you lie down on a towel, looking around anxiously and feeling very exposed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-nude3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You can almost feel the gazes of the other beach goers, as palpable as the sun’s rays upon your skin.

Evan finds someone to play beach volleyball with but you refuse to participate. That&#39;s where you draw the limit for what you do in the nude. Evan seems completely uninhibited by his nudity.

After half an hour, [[you decide it&#39;s time to flip over.]] //Not that I care about getting an even tan or anything...//

&quot;Ahh, what a day...&quot;

The experience has been rejuvinating!
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wetskinnydipping.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&quot;Are you glad you came?&quot; Evan asks you.

&quot;Yep! Hey, do you think the water is getting higher?”

Evan shrugs, clearly more interested in your body than the sea. “It’s just the waves. [[Before we go, could you do something real sexy for me?]]&quot; Evan asks.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2506" name="The things you are willing to do for Evan…" tags="" position="2435,24167" size="100,100"> &quot;Like this?&quot; You ask as you move about awkwardly on your hands and feet.

 &quot;You&#39;re so hot Taylor!&quot; Evan declares. &quot;Perfect!&quot;

 You overestimate your strength and suddenly your arms give out and you plant your naked ass in the sand. &quot;Fuck!&quot; You scream. &quot;Now I got fucking sand in my fucking vagina!&quot;

 Evan seems unperturbed by your outburst. &quot;Say that again,&quot; he says with a wide grin plastered across his face.

 &quot;What? Oh, screw you Evan!&quot; You shift onto your side and look down on your sand covered behind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-crab4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Oh damn, it’s all //grainy!

[[Try to brush the sand off]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2507" name="Try to brush the sand off" tags="" position="2415,24277" size="100,100">Your efforts only seem to spread the grains all over your body.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-crab5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 You sigh. You&#39;re going to have to get into the water again to get all this sand off. &quot;What kind of fucked up fetish is this supposed to be, anyway?&quot; You demand of Evan.

 The grin on Evan&#39;s face grows even wider. “A sandy one. I don’t mind a little grit if you want to do it here.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wetskinnydipping2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &quot;Oh no you didn&#39;t.&quot; Realisation dawns on you. &quot;You&#39;re in so much trouble! You can go right ahead and //kiss my ass// if you think you&#39;re getting any tonight!&quot;

 &quot;Challenge accepted!&quot; Evan says, then scoops you up into his arms and carries you towards the water.

 You punch him in the chest, but he doesn&#39;t even seem to notice it. As he shifts you in his arms for a more comfortable grip, you wrap your arms around his neck. So he won&#39;t drop you. That&#39;s all there is to it, you tell yourself.
 
After cleaning up, you and Evan are forced to run along the coast as the rising tide laps at your heels. [[The dangerous return trip is almost as exciting as the skinny dipping.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2508" name="you decide it&#39;s time to flip over." tags="" position="2565,23977" size="100,100">You find lying on your stomach to be more comfortable despite your squished boobs. With your breasts out of sight, you don&#39;t feel //quite// so exposed anymore. You let the sun’s warmth heat up your back.

“You want some lotion? You don’t want a burned bottom,” Evan advises. 

You’re already naked so you accept his offer, letting your boyfriend massage your back during the application. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-nude4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 You soon notice a pattern. A group of nude, fat older men walk past you. For the third time in half an hour. You can&#39;t tell but you&#39;re pretty sure they&#39;re ogling your bare ass. You&#39;re also fairly certain that one of them is Mr. Deter, a teacher from school.

//Of course he hangs out at a place like this...//

 Luckily, Evan comes to your rescue before one of the oaf nearly steps on you in a lame attempt to get a better look.

//Fuck these guys! I am not letting them ruin our fun!// You decide to go skinny dipping with Evan.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-nude2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The water feels nice and the attention you get from the rest of the beach goers becomes less awkward and more thrilling with each passing moment.

[[Having enough of the other ocean goers, you follow Evan to the edge of the beach.|“Let’s get out of the water before I turn into a prune.”]]

You go to bed early. The next day, you slog through school.

Sometime in the late afternoon, your burner phone rings with an unknown number on the caller ID.

After a few rings, you decide to answer.“Hello?” 

“Taylor!” Craig’s voice greets you. “I-I need to talk to you.”

You sigh. “Hi, Craig.”

Craig makes some sniffing noises. It sounds like he has been crying.

“What’s wrong, Craig? And how did you get this number?”

“I looked in Sandra’s phone,” he answers, sounding genuinely tired and sad. “I need your help. I am gonna f-fail! I don’t wanna fail!” Craig sobs. “I don’t understand anything!”

//That last part is definitely true...// “Craig, I have my own problems to deal with. I need to find a cure for my condition so I can--”

“//No!// D-don’t do that! I need you to help me s-study. I ca~an’t fail… Everyone will laugh at me. They are s-so mean. You’re the only girl who is nice to me. Please, Taylor? ”

“I am not a girl…” you correct him with a sigh.

“Everyone thinks I’m dumb.”

“Craig, we both know you’re not dumb.”

“I know! I’m smart! I just need help… from you. I can’t concentrate. I need help!”

“You already said that…” //Well, at least he hasn’t threatened to blackmail me … yet.//

Even though you suspect Craig is far more dangerous than he appears, you still can’t help but feel sorry for him.

You are amazed at the power of pity.

[[“Fine, I’ll help you out but you need to behave.”]]
[[“We can study the next time I come over. I am busy tonight.”]]

//How do I keep getting sucked into helping this big kid? Is it fear? Obligation? Pitty? Or something else…?// you wonder. //Maybe I am just being a doormat.//

You arrive at the Bell residence earlier than any previous occasion. &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Sandra&quot; &quot;Sandra desc&quot;&gt;&gt; is surprised to see you.

“Tammy! I didn’t know you were coming by today.”

“I agreed to help Craig study,” you explain.

“Aww, you’re so sweet. I’m sure with your help he will pass with flying colors!”

“I’ll do my best…”

“If you’re going to be around for a bit, do you mind if I quickly run an errand?”

You were kind of hoping Sandra would be nearby to help moderate Craig’s behavior. “Sure. I’m glad to help…”

“What would we do without you? I will only be a few hours!”

You head upstairs and knock on the door.

“Taaaylor!” &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Craig&quot; &quot;Craig desc&quot;&gt;&gt; rushes up to you and hugs you so tightly you fear your ribs will snap.

[[“Keep it down! Call me Tammy.”]]

“Uh, I didn’t agree to that…”

“MooOOOOoooM! Tammy agreed to watch me while you go to the Caribbean! You can do your cruise!” Craig announces.

An absolutely jubilant &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Sandra&quot; &quot;Sandra desc&quot;&gt;&gt; can be heard in the background. “I knew she would come through! Tammy is an angel. You hear that, Tammy? You’re an ANGEL!” you listen to Sandra’s loud praise with mixed emotions.

//Damnit… How can I refuse now? Craig is pretty sly sometimes...//

//I don’t want to be a doormat… but...// You just can’t quite muster the courage to disappoint Sandra. Craig’s disappointment is secondary but factors in too. After speaking to Sandra and accepting her gushing praise, the phone is passed back to &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Craig&quot; &quot;Craig desc&quot;&gt;&gt;.

“Craig, are you alone now? I want to say something to you in private.”

“Oookay. I’m alone now.”

“Craig, I will watch you but you have to promise me two things. You’re going to keep my secret //and// you’re going to knock off all the creepy stuff, got it?”

“I promise!”

It isn’t long before the day of your obligation dawns. Mrs and &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Mr. Bell&quot; &quot;Mr. Bell desc&quot;&gt;&gt; [[are in a rush to get their suitcases loaded and arrive early enough for their flight.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2512" name="“Keep it down! Call me Tammy.”" tags="" position="4863,22814" size="100,100">“Okay, Tay--ammy. Which name do you like better?”

“My real name.”

Eager for something to distract you from the atmosphere in Craig’s room, you ask the young man about his studies.

He shows you a math problem and an English poem.

“It makes no sense! Both of them!”

“What did you think of the poem?”

“I didn’t finish it.”

“Well, the first step is to read it. Sheesh. You can’t ask for help before even starting. I’m not going to do your homework for you.”

“Okay…”

You have been in Craig’s room for barely five minutes before Craig demands a study aid.

//I’m already regretting this decision. I am way too fucking nice...// “What do you want, Craig? Good juice? Candy?” //Just think of the money, Taylor… Mmm cash bonus...//

“I want another special kiss! Special kiss! Special kiss!” Craig cheers, shouting so loudly that you fear the neighbors might overhear and get the wrong impression. 

“Shhh! Craig! Shhhh! Fuck! Not so loud!” //I really hope Sandra left already...//

“So you’ll do it for me again?”

“No! You need to study!”

“I can’t study without a r-reward.”

“Your reward is not failing!” You encourage Craig to study on his own. “Ask me only if you find something you can’t figure out on your own,” you instruct him.

Craig slumps over the open book on his desk. He turns his head to the side in order to pout in your direction.

“Craig, read the damn book. At least look at the pages.”

“I can’t.”

[[“Why the hell not?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2513" name="“Why the hell not?”" tags="" position="4863,22964" size="100,100">“Because I c-c-c-an’t stop thinking about you.” Craig fidgets in his chair, revealing the very obvious outline of an erection. “I promise to study if you give me a //special kiss//.”

“Grr. I came here to help you study, not play games with you.” 

“I want to l-learn more about your body.” Before you can protest further, Craig turns his chair to face you. He then drops his pants.

“What are y-”

Craig’s massive dick is presented to you at full attention. “I am like this all because of you.”

“No… Craig, you know who I am…”

“Don’t worry! I won’t tell anyone you were a boy as long as you are nice to me,” Craig assures you.

You feel like there is something wrong with the world. Every time you try to do right, you get pushed further away from your ideals despite your attempts to keep them close at hand.

“Taaaylor!” Craig whines.

//Oh my god. What if Sandra hears him?//

“Shut up!”

//Oh, for fuck’s sake!//

Feeling utterly trapped between a variety of no-win situations, you throw down a pillow and kneel down next to Craig.

[[Everything is downhill from there.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2514" name="Everything is downhill from there." tags="" position="4863,23114" size="100,100">“Fine, I’ll help you out but you need to be quiet.”

Your fingers barely fit around Craig’s shaft. You give him a handjob, hoping to make him cum quickly.

But you just end up stroking… and stroking… and stroking…

//Fap-fap-fap-fap-fap...//

As your arm and wrist start to get tired, you begin to panic. You begin to fondle Craig’s balls, sure the act will ensure that he finishes quickly.

“Oh Taaaylor! That feels sooo good!”

“Be quiet!”

“Hahhh! Okay… But your hands feel //SO// good! Way better t-than my hands!

//Fuck, what’s going on here?// You pump Craig’s cock as quickly as you can but you cramp up just as Craig begins to groan loudly.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craighj.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ahh… Darn...” Your hand is limp and throbbing, coated with Craig’s precum.

You’re about to switch hands when Craig demands his //special kiss.// [[With a sigh, you lower your mouth over Craig’s weeping cock.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2515" name="With a sigh, you lower your mouth over Craig’s weeping cock." tags="" position="4863,23264" size="100,100">“Ooooh. I love the special kiss!” Craig cries.

“Omm… Please be quiet. Omm… Guh... This isn’t a kiss!”

“You’re right! It’s better! The special kiss!”

There is only one way to shut Craig up...

You struggle to lower your jaw enough to take him comfortably in your mouth. Craig’s bitter taste fills your senses. His lack of hygiene no doubt contributes to the funky smells you inhale with each breath.

“Wheew…” //I can’t believe I am doing this… AGAIN...//

“Om... Om… Ahh… Fahh…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/saucyhead.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your disgust fades as you establish a steady rhythm. You imagine that you are somewhere far away.

“Taylor, you’re //sooo good!// And I feel even better!”

//That doesn’t even make any sense! None of this does!//

Your mouth begins to flood with salty, bitter fluid, heralding what comes next.

//No! I need to grab a tissue or something quick!//

But before you can react, a huge spray of cum splatters across your face. //Why am I taking this guy’s load?//

You breathe through strands of semen. “Hwaahh…” //Gross...//

//Fuck, at least that was over quick… But now all this disgusting stuff is everywhere...//

“I’ll study now!” Craig assures you. After admiring your cloudy face for a moment, he begins to rapidly write down a bunch answers, making you doubt if he ever needed help in the first place.

You retreat to the bathroom and clean up. You avoid looking in the mirror, afraid of what sort of look you may see in reflected in your own eyes.

You give yourself a scalding sink bath before finally returning to the hall.

&quot;Why hello there!&quot; [[a friendly baritone voice nearly scares the shit out of you.|bell alt]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2516" name="bell alt" tags="" position="4863,23414" size="100,100">&quot;AH! You scared me! I mean… //hi,//&quot; you awkwardly greet the intruder, a man who you quickly recognize as Sophie&#39;s dad, Mr. Bell. You haven’t seen the senior member of the Bell family in years. His sudden appearance isn’t exactly surprising given it’s his house.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/mrbell.jpg&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
You hope your awkwardness comes across as shyness.

&quot;You must be Tammy!” the middle aged man predicts. 

&quot;That&#39;s right. You must be Mr. Bell!&quot; You flash him a friendly smile. 

&quot;Guilty as charged. You don’t have to be so formal. I’d prefer if you call me Jake. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Tammy.”

“Likewise.”

Mr. Bell’s cold blue eyes sweep over you from toe to head. “Sandra mentioned you were pretty but //wow…// I would have left work a bit early just for a chance to see you.&quot;

//That’s a pretty weird thing to say...// &quot;Um, thanks.&quot;

“No, I’m serious. You’re one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen. That you spend all your time with Craig is a crying shame.”

//Great, he just met “Tammy” for the first time and he is already hitting on her… .//

You awkwardly fend off a few more appearance based compliments until the one sided conversation finds a lull.

“You’re probably eager to get home,” Jake guesses.

“Yeah, it has been a long day…” you admit. //And that’s one heck of an understatement!// “I think Craig is doing his homework for once. I should head out so I don’t distract him.”

[[The conversation suddenly takes a left turn.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2517" name="The conversation suddenly takes a left turn." tags="" position="4863,23564" size="100,100">Jake sucks in his lip, like he is about to deliver some bad news. “Well I’m afraid we have a little bit of a problem here. I can’t let you go quite yet.”

Bell’s tone makes you wary. Your warning instincts are confirmed a moment later when Mr. Bell leans forward, invading your personal space until you can smell his sour breath. &quot;I saw what you were doing with Craig earlier,&quot; he says to you with a somewhat accusatory tone.

Your heart sinks into your chest. You can only blink rapidly in surprise. //Uh oh!// &quot;You //saw us?// Uhhh… Ah.&quot; //Fuck! I didn’t know he was home! How much does he know?!//

Your worst fears are realized as Bell nods with a smirk painted across his face. “From what I could see I think there is only one interpretation. It looked to me like you were trying to take advantage of my disabled son.” 

//No fuckin’ way! That’s his interpretation?! Craig was taking advantage of ME, not the other fucking way around!// You realize that Jake has clearly underestimated his adopted son.  Either that, or he is messing with you.

//Gulp.// You fail to dislodge the lump in your throat. You feel like you’re going to be sick.

But the man you once considered a family friend leaves you no respite. &quot;What would Sandra or your classmates think?&quot; Mr. Bell throws the question at you like a projectile. “Or maybe even law enforcement? Craig has the mind of a child. What you did is pantamount to rape. You are in serious trouble, missy.”

//What?!// &quot;Uhhhh… I didn’t… ah, Craig isn’t--ahh, damnit! I’m sorry!&quot; //Is he trying to blackmail me!?// &quot;Please say you don&#39;t mean that!&quot;

Mr. Bell shrugs. “Of course I do. I am still a bit shocked a cute young lady like you would indulge Craig. Craig needs //help,// but not that kind of help!”

You cringe.

[[“I must say I’m both disappointed and kind of happy that you turned out to be such a slut.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2518" name="“I must say I’m both disappointed and kind of happy that you turned out to be such a slut.”" tags="" position="4863,23714" size="100,100">“I’m not a slut!”

Jake rolls his eyes. “I’m much more experienced than Craig. I can teach you things that you’d only ever dream of.”

//He is totally trying to get in my pants! What an asshole.//

You try and regain a small degree of control. “What do you want from me?”

&quot;Well since I know you’re already familiar with male equipment how about a blowjob? For starters.&quot;

You are aghast. &quot;//For starters!?// That&#39;s impossible!&quot;

Jake Bell smirks. &quot;After what I saw going on in Craig&#39;s room? You don&#39;t have to act all coy; I already know you&#39;re a slut.” 

&quot;That&#39;s not true! Things just got really out of hand… I lost this game and...&quot; You stop mid sentence when you realize further elaboration would not help your cause.

Jake rolls his eyes. “You obviously love cock, so you might as well worship mine for a bit. I promise having fun with me will be more enjoyable than with Craig. At least I’m cleaner.&quot;

“Sandra won’t be back for an hour or two,” Jake explains. With a chuckle, Mr. Bell grabs your shoulder and leads you into the master bedroom.

Your feet feel like they are bound with lead weights but you have no choice but to follow him.

“I’ll keep your little secret if you share one with me,” Bell says to you once you are inside.

“Share one? I don’t know what you mean. I can’t do this. Please!”

“All I want is an intimate moment like you had with Craig. It will reestablish a bit of the broken trust between us. Take your clothes off, Tammy.”

You are absolutely shocked by Mr. Bell’s behavior. You’ve never seen this side of him before. All your memories of him are laughs and smiles but now there is no trace of his regular good humor. It freaks you out that most of the men you respected now seem to treat you like a piece of meat.

You shake you head. “I don’t want to.”

“Did you want to go down on Craig?”

“No!”

[[“But you did it anyway.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2519" name="“But you did it anyway.”" tags="" position="4863,23865" size="100,100">“I had to…”

Mr. Bell gives off a derisive snort before he crosses his arms over his chest. “Well now you have to again. You took advantage of my son, so now I’m going to take advantage of you. Show me some skin.”

“That’s…” // way too far! Fuck! Did my transformation make all the men into creeps or were they all like that before and I just never noticed? Was I like that too…? No! I can’t think about all this right now. I need to find a way out of this quagmire!// Yet, in the pressure of the moment, you cannot find one. “Damnit, just my top.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytoplessa.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Mr. Bell ogles your chest without a hint of shame. “That’s a start. You’ve got a cute little rack!” He whistles approvingly. “They are a bit small but otherwise those are some perfect perky tits!”

Jake gives you a familiar look. Although you are aware that the relationship between Jake and his adopted son is very strained, they seem more alike than not.

//I just got through with Craig and now this is happening? Damnit! Out of the frying pan and into the flames!//

Now two members of this weird family have seen your breasts under duress.

You shrink under Bell’s unwavering gaze. The best you can manage is to use your arm as a bra to cover yourself. “There. You’ve seen them. May I please go now?”

Jake shakes his head. “No. You haven’t even sucked my dick yet!”

You almost feel like crying but manage to keep most of your emotions directed inwardly. “Do I have to?”

“Yes, you do, Tammy. Unless you want to deal with the consequences,” Bell offers the alternative with a roll of his eyes as if it is wholly undesirable.

//Of course he doesn’t know my real name! Maybe I could just run and flake out and hope he never finds me? But even then, what if he calls the cops and they look into my life? I am not sure I want… or can even endure any scrutiny right now. How the hell do I explain any of what has happened to me? Gaaaah! I don’t want to be a toy for Craig or his dad!//

You feel that you have to:
[[Bear the consequences of your actions]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2520" name="Bear the consequences of your actions" tags="" position="4788,24015" size="100,100">You are giving an unexpected blow job for the second time in a single day.

“Don’t look so angry! At least act like you enjoy it,” Jake advises as you suck his cock.

“Omm… Omm… Mmm…” //Why does this keep happening to me?//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bellblow.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You wrap your fingers around the base of his shaft and give Bell’s member a few pumps.

“Kiss it,” he demands.

You follow his instructions, eager for this act to over as quickly as possible. “Damnit… Mwah… Mmm…”

“Thatta girl! Work your tongue over the head… Ahhh yeah, just like that.”

You can feel every vein and bit of fleshy texture as you run your tongue down his shaft.

You mind becomes increasingly jumbled with each gulping pass along Bell’s penis. Your act of service is humiliating. The only tiny consolation is that Mr. Bell doesn’t know who you really are.

“That’s it! Take more of my cock!” Mr. Bell grunts as he slams his cock down your throat until you gag. Tears flood your eyes, more from lack of oxygen than anything else. Or at least that’s what you tell yourself.

//I just need to focus on getting him off… then everything will be over… At least for now.//

Your movements become smoother as you become accustomed to the motion. A disturbing thought enters your mind: your practice with Craig has apparently paid off.

[[“See? You sure know your way around a dick,”]] Bell says approvingly.

Mr. Bell bulges in your mouth. His cock seems unnaturally large and makes you self conscious.

“Ahh! That cute look. I can’t take it anymore!”

With no further warning, Jake nuts all over your face.

//Sppllloot!//

Warm semen drips down your face. Mr. Bell pushes his wet cock back into your mouth.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bellfinish.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You are so disoriented it takes you a moment to pull back. //Holy fuck, he came so much…//

Your senses are overloaded. The sticky substance covers your lips and tongue. It tastes like squid. There is so much cum you inhale the awful smell with every breath.

//Click.//

You look up to see Mr. Bell with his cellphone in hand. 

//Click.//

“I’m just taking a little memento. Don’t worry about it.”

“Please no… I did what you wanted.”

“And that was a good start. Still, I think I let you off easy considering what I caught you doing earlier. Sandra billed you as a polite, smart girl who could help Craig with his grades and give us a bit more time for our lives. Instead, what I saw was pretty out of line. I don’t care what you do, but surely that was a violation of trust. So you have to earn it back. What you did just now was a good start.”

“We are done!” you hiss. [[You return to the washroom for the second time within an hour for the reason of cleaning up cum.]]

After liberally washing your face, you turn your attention to other matters.

You feel a bit weird //down there.// You decide to take a peek.

A somewhat funky smell, a sweet feminine musk assaults your nostrils. A patch of wetness coats the front of your underwear. There is a snail trail connecting your vagina to the fabric. Your lower your hand and your fingers come back covered in love juice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/wetpussy1.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Nooo! Gross. Holy fuck, this isn’t good! I sucked two dicks and now I am a hot mess. Why? That is so screwed up...” you trail off as you realize you don’t like where that path of thought is leading.

You sigh while you clean up for the second time that night. You feel a bit tingly and frustrated. You are sorely disappointed in yourself.

“How the hell do I get myself into this shit?”

Even after all the time spent washing, you swear you can still faintly smell Mr. Bell’s semen.

//Or is it Craig’s…? Ewww….?// 

You feel absolutely wretched. //It’s all I because I have this hot body!// you sulk.

After cleaning up, you head downstairs just in time to meet Sandra as she returns home.

Mr. Bell steps out from the kitchen, all smiles. He lies smoothly to his wife about only just arriving home himself. He then offers you a ride.

You put on a fake smile. “No, that’s all right.”

“Oh, it’s no bother! I insist,” Jake replies. Before you can more thoroughly refuse, he grabs his keys and leads the way outside.

You have no choice except to follow.

[[The ride home is the epitome of awkwardness.]]

“How many men have you slept with this semester?” Mr. Bell interrupts your thoughts with a lewd question.

You are so annoyed by the question you answer without really thinking. “Zero,” you reply flatly.

“What about last year?”

“ZERO.”

Jake raises an eyebrow. “You mean that you’ve never done it before? You&#39;ve never had sex? Is that what you’re saying?”

You remain silent but your blushing face betrays you.

“If you’re that good at sucking dick and you’re only at the start of your sex life… Well, there is only one way to go and that is up, babe.”

//Sophie’s dad just called me a babe… Guh, I think I am going to be sick!//

“Here is fine!” You pop the car lock and exit the vehicle at a stop light.

After a short jog, you are finally home free.

Evidently, your body’s engine is still warmed up from your earlier frustrations.

You put your fingers to work and are shocked at how easily they sink into your sodden flesh.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/toplesscum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Shlick-slick-shlick-shlick-shlick-shlick!//

“Haaahh! Unnnnnnnnnghhhhaa….”

You cum quickly and hard, as if you’d been pent up for days. You flop around like a fish on land as your body is rocked with pleasurable aftershocks that vibrate you to your very core.

“Mmm… //wow//. This body… what a curse. I really hope I wasn’t feeling so sexually frustrated because of what happened today...” //But it is pretty clearly connected… Fuck. Today was the worst!

“Who is this?” you message back, fearing the likely answer.

You receive an image reply.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/response.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I was considering posting this on the university message board,” reads some text underneath. “Meet me in an hour if you’d like to discuss //alternatives.//&quot;

//Mr. Bell! Grrrrrrrr!//

You feel like you are being swept up in events beyond your control. //If I keep submitting to these guys, what will happen to me?//

But other than obedience what choice do you have? Your life is already kind of shitty but you realize it could always get a lot worse.

With a heavy heart, you begin the walk to the Bell residence.

Jake greets you with a grin so wide it splits is his face in half. “I see you made the right choice, Tammy! Smart girl,” he praises you. He gives you an awkward hug with his hands lingering a bit too long over your hips and ass.

//I guess I know where Craig picked up a few of his techniques. What a shitty role-model.//

“Don’t worry, we have some privacy. Craig is with Sandra,” [[Jake explains as he ushers you into the kitchen.]]

In answer to your question, Mr. Bell whips out his dick.

“Whoa…” //Holy shit. Was it this big the other day?! I mean, why the fuck is he whipping his dick out!?//

Jake Bell’s cock is enormous. It is thicker and longer than your forearm. The sweaty musk radiating off of it is nearly overwhelming. It makes you feel genuinely dizzy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/kitchenbell.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Pretty nice, eh? So which cock do you prefer? Mine or Craig’s?”

“They are both gross,” you assert.

Jake laughs. “That isn’t an answer.” He looks at you expectantly.

[[“Yours.”]]
[[Craig’s]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2528" name="“Yours.”" tags="" position="4713,25065" size="100,100">Jake’s grin widens even further. “Of course. Well, you’ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with it. I kind of wish I could bring you on the cruise with me instead of Sandra.”

//Noooo! That would be even worse than being locked in a cage with Craig!//

“I am not sucking your dick again,” you declare.

“Music to my ears,” Bell agrees, apparently taking a different interpretation of your words. “Take your clothes off. I think we should fuck.”

Your heart sinks into your chest, pushed by feelings of despair.

“N-no, that’s not what I meant!”

[[Beg him not to fuck you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2529" name="Craig’s" tags="" position="4859,25064" size="100,100">Jake snorts. You notice his eyes crinkle in annoyance. “I don’t believe you. At any rate, I’m sure you will learn to love it eventually. Dick is an acquired taste I hear.”

“I am not sucking your dick again,” you declare.

“Music to my ears,” Bell agrees, apparently taking a different interpretation of your words. “Take your clothes off. I think we should fuck.”

Your heart sinks into your chest, pushed by feelings of despair.

Please!” You throw out every sympathetic argument you can think of. You even bat your long eyelashes at him in an attempt to wring every last drop of sympathy from him.

Except Jake is apparently devoid of such emotion.

Bell shrugs. “I’d rather see you naked than listen to you talk,” he cuts you off.

//Ouch...// Your tiny hands ball into fists. You barely manage to avoid smacking Jake.

Bell begins to touch you. He pulls you back when you draw away, holding you firmly in place while he molests you. His strong hands roam around your body. You stare at the ceiling, praying that you are willful enough to endure this awful night.

Things get progressively worse as Jake slowly begins to peel off your clothing, replete with frequent inappropriate squeezes.

//Ughh. This is the worst...// you think, but further lows are in sight.

“Please don’t fuck me,” you beg as Bell lines up his dick with your vagina.

“I guess it is a bit much to deflower an unwilling girl. So I just have to make you become willing!”

“That will never happen! Aiiii!” your sudden yelp spoils your defiant act. 

The older man starts to hotdog you…  [[His weiner slides into the valley between your buns.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2531" name="His weiner slides into the valley between your buns." tags="" position="4713,25365" size="100,100">“Wow, you’ve got a great ass too.”

The sensation is unlike anything you have ever experienced. The stimulation on your anus tickles and adds further impetus to the tingling vortex emanating from your clitoris.

“Ahhhh!”

“UHhhhHHhhh!” Bell groans loudly in pleasure, eclipsing your own cries.

His smooth fingers find your clit. With a gentle motion his middle finger tenderly rubs at your bud and the slick central line down your weeping love petals.

Bell’s movements gradually increase until you are both panting. His determined fingers bring you closer to the edge.

//This is bad! I don’t want to enjoy any part of this!//

The movements are far too much like sex for your comfort. You feel like you are going insane. “Hnnnnnaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you cry out as you orgasm and a cascade of blissful warmth tears through every cell in your body.

“Hah, that’s right. Cum like a horny sow! Ahhh…. Take this! Uhhh! Ahhh! I’m cumming!” Bell announces as he blows all over your backside.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/begbutt.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Afterwards, you drop down  on wobbly knees to the kitchen tile, ashamed at how hard you just came.

“See? Look at how soaked you are! This can be a mutually beneficial arrangement.”

“I…” You trail off, [[unable to find the words to ward off the spell of blackmail.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2532" name="unable to find the words to ward off the spell of blackmail." tags="" position="4713,25515" size="100,100">“Whew!” Bell begins stroking his cock.

You shake your head in terror.

“That’s fine… for now. Get on your knees.”

//Will this nightmare ever fucking end?!//

“Let me give you what you deserve,” Bell says to you as he jerks off in your face
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/deserve.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You take a huge face full of semen. Mr. Bell shoots out so much that you are amazed by the volume... until he finishes and the shame sets in.

//Fuck my life...//

&quot;What can I say, Tammy? You bring out the best in me. Ahh...&quot;

Evan’s skills have improved in the weeks that you have been intimate. With his hot tongue jammed up your ass, and his lovely fingers treating your clit like putty, Evan skillfully guides you towards a shuddering orgasm.

“Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm…”

You fall asleep spooning Evan.

When you wake up you feel a bit guilty. “Mmm… How long was I out for?” //I guess I left Evan hanging back there… I guess I can easily make up for that...//

“Hee-he!”

You work your magic and delight in Evan’s pleasure.

It doesn’t take long before Evan comes like a freight train. Your best friend deposits a fat load at the back of your throat. You swallow and clean up, careful to lick your fingers clean under Evan’s watchful eyes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ballsuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Evan has never looked happier. His good mood always proves to be infectious.

//What is happening to us?// you silently wonder.

A man walking by gives you an enthusiastic wolf whistle.

“This swimsuit doesn’t really leave much to the imagination…” you complain.

“I know! It’s awesome! But you know what might be even better?”

“What?”

 &quot;We should go skinny dipping!&quot; Evan says enthusiastically. &quot;I mean, you look awesome in that bikini, but you&#39;d look even greater out of it!&quot; He continues, goofy grin on his face.

 You look at him and try to judge if he&#39;s really expecting that to happen, like fucking ever. You reflexively almost cross your legs at the very thought of stripping down on a public beach.

“Besides, no one even knows its you. Just be a hot babe for a day and enjoy yourself, sheesh.”

“I guess…”

“I like you with clothes and without,” Evan responds. “We only live once, right? Let’s skinny dip! It’ll be fun!” 

“There are people out here!” 

You glance around anxiously. There are at least twenty other beach goers in sight.

Your temporary boyfriend shrugs. “So what?” 

“You’re going to get naked right here?”

“If you join me. What’s the big deal anyway? Air and sun is good for the skin.” Evan is a bit too eager to show off his weiner in public. “It’s //natural!//” he insists.

//More like unnatural… Evan always has a dumb answer for everything...//

 &quot;What then?&quot; You ask suspiciously.

 Evan assaults you with flattery and compliments, &quot;You&#39;re just so sexy, and it&#39;s really hot when a girl is on all fours, but you know, hands behind her back, like a, uh, crab, you know?&quot; He looks down on you. &quot;Pleeease?&quot;

 &quot;The fuck, Evan? You’re such a big perv that you even find crabs arousing!&quot; Evan’s request does sound harmless enough though. //And we are all alone on this beach here...// 

It doesn&#39;t take long for Evan to convince you. With a theatrical sigh, you give in.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/beach-crab3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Posing for Evan is far more fun than it should be.

“Hnnnnggghh!!” Evan’s eyes nearly pop out of his head when you finish changing and present the next outfit. 

“I like this style!” he cheers when he finally finds his voice. “Feel free to dress like this anytime!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tryout2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Yeah, right… this is pretty embarrassing.”

“You don’t have to be embarrassed, Taylor. It’s just us here. I’d never judge you. Let’s just be real and enjoy our time together.”

“But we just spend all our time dicking around...er… literally…”

“Haha.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2540" name="Your days with Evan morph into a pleasurable pattern..." tags="" position="2920,23645" size="100,100">You touch yourself often. Your whole body seems to be slowly transforming into a giant erogenous zone.

“Uhhnnn! I am so horny… I am //always// so horny these days, err--hornier than average!” Your eyes land on your cell phone. “Hmmm…”

//Maybe Evan would appreciate a little video?//

“Hmmm… HMM!” With a mischievous spirit seizing hold of you, you shoot a quick video for your closest friend. It is thrilling to show off your naughtiness.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/sendtoevandingdong.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Heh. I bet that will give him a nosebleed!” you say with a laugh as you hit the send button.

 //Ding-dong!// The sound of your doorbell echoes throughout the house.

“Oh. Who could that be?” You rush to slip on some loose clothing before heading to the door.

Even though Evan lives over ten minutes away, he is on your doorstep in less than two.

“//Evan!?// How did you get here so fast?”

[[“I couldn’t pass up your invitation.”]]

Evan holds up his phone and hits play. A familiar video pops up on screen.

“Oh…” //I guess that was a bit suggestive.//

“If this isn’t an invitation, then I don’t know what is,” Evan remarks.

You feel your face flush. “I just thought you would appreciate it,” you explain.

“I did, I do! Are you going to invite me in?”

“I guess…”

Evan follows you inside. You pause awkwardly in the kitchen. “You want something to eat?”

“Only you.”

“Hyaah!” He grabs you by the hand and leads you upstairs. Since you put this chain of events into motion, you don’t even bother protesting.

//Why do I keep doing this to myself? Being a woman feels too good sometimes!//

You get a degree of satisfaction from Evan’s predictable gasp when you pull your sweater over your head.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/removetop.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Wow… Taylor, you’re my goddess… My life has been blessed since you came into it.” Evan spoils the atmosphere a moment later by adding, “I love your cute little boobs too,” once your top hits the ground.

“Well, here’s a close up of them,” you reply while unclipping your bra.

Evan’s mouth falls open even though he has seen you naked many times. You still seem to captivate his attention at the same level. If anything, Evan seems more transfixed by you than ever before.  “Whoa…” he gulps.

Your panties join your other clothes on the floor.

Evan grins at you. “I love my life.”

//Fap-fap-fap-fap-fap!//

You roll your eyes. “You’re enjoying this a bit too much…” Evan reminds you of a dirty monkey as he jerks off at your display. “You’re such an unbelievable pervert,” you chide him. You want to pet the tingling mound between your legs but manage to resist because you possess at least a modicum of self control, unlike your best friend.

“Ughh… Uhh… Hnnhgg… Uh! I just can’t… help myself…” Evan groans.

[[You sigh. “Neither can I.”]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/strippingforevan.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Wow, I am perpetually amazed by your prime quality ass,” he says admiringly.

“Kch…” You glance at Evan and find that he is already naked below the waist, hard cock gripped in hand.

//Evan and I have an incurable disease...//

Your eyes flit about the room before returning to Evan’s groin. Your face flushes at the same time your body’s most sensitive areas from scalp to toe begin to tingle. 

You run a delicate finger down the center of your vagina and inspect it. It is completely coated in love juices. You glance between the evidence of your lust and Evan’s. His petrified cock is pointed directly at you. //And Lord help you, you want it so badly that it nearly hurts.// “Hwyaah!”

//Damnit! Damnit! Damnit! We are both hopeless...//

Following your body’s less than subtle signals, you lie down on Evan’s bed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/showevan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnnghh! You’re so fuckin’ sexy, Taylor!  Let’s do it doggy style!” Evan urges you

“No! Hold on! I need a frickin’ moment here. I’m not ready yet so stay back! Exercise some self control for a change, will ya?”

Evan huffs in disappointment. [[He begins to stroke himself with even more vigor as you drape your body over the covers and spread your legs in an effort to tease Evan.]]

“Wow, your pussy is glistening! You’re dripping on the bed!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/showevan2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I can’t help it…”

“Neither can,” Evan replies. “Can we do it now?!”

“Heh. Be patient.”

“That’s easy for you to say!”

“You know patience is a virtue right? You can’t rush these things. We can’t just rut like mindless animals, you know!”

“Hnng…”

“You’re pretty fun to tease, Evan.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/showevan3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Taylor… Don’t be mean.”

You laugh at Evan. You can’t help but taunt him further by spreading your labia to show off your cute little wet cunny.

“You’re such a beautiful shade of pink…”  

Your already tomato red cheeks ripen even further. [[You wish Evan would shut up.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2545" name="You wish Evan would shut up." tags="" position="2920,24395" size="100,100">Of course he never does. Evan is in lawyer-mode, consumed with finding a loophole to exploit. “If you won’t let me fuck you, then I will just have to //kiss// you!”

A second later, Evan&#39;s lips are on your own.

“Hm!? Mmmm…? Oh...” 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tayevankissing.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mwah… Phaaa…”

You and Evan make out with surprising tenderness. He covers your cheeks, forehead, and nose with kisses before focusing on your mouth.

You struggle to keep up and reciprocate in some fashion but it is hard to when you are feeling increasingly intoxicated with each moment. 

“You’re such a good kisser, Taylor...”

You take a deep breath.
[[“You’re not so bad yourself…”]]x

It is like you are sucking my finger in…”

“//Please shut up!//”

Evan accelerates his motions while repeatedly brushing against the roof of your vaginal canal. He finds the most perfect spot, leading you to a toe curling orgasm.  Your soft, sweaty skin tingles from head to toe.

//How did Evan make me cum so fast?// you ask the question in a state of disbelief.  You feel warm while the periphery of your vision has become fuzzy… all except for the patch in the middle where Evan resides.

“Taylor, I am like this because of you! I need your help.”

//Zzzzzzip.//

[[Evan presents you with his massive erection.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2548" name="Evan presents you with his massive erection." tags="" position="2995,24695" size="100,100">You lovingly smother Evan’s cock with kisses while jerking him off with your free hand.

Evan has been waiting so long that he can’t hold out against your efforts. Your soft hands and agile tongue bring Evan to infinity and beyond.

“Oh my fuckin’ AHH! OHhhh~ aHhhhhahhh!
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/cumshotpov.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hehe! Cum for me!”

You move your hand even faster. //Fap-fap-fap-fap-fap!// 

“Yeeessss aaaaaaahhhhh!” Evan groans.

You stick out your tongue as you pump Evan’s bulging cock.

“I’m cumming!”

“Fuck yes! Give it to me!” you shout as Evan begins his epic eruption.

Several excessive spurts of cum splash onto your face and waiting tongue. One blast goes right down the back of your throat.

But you take it all like a champ, revelling in your temporary boyfriend’s load that he made in your honor.

A drained and exhausted Evan topples over. “I love you so much,” he mumbles.

You sigh. //I’m sure Evan loves what we do, not me...//

Lucas yawns. “I tend to get whatever I want,” he asserts. The arrogant man’s imperious, infallible confidence annoys and frightens you to your very core. 

//Maybe it is fake!// “It’s some kind of trick!”

Lucas scoffs. “I am a very influential man. I do not suffer imitation… unless I control the transformation.”

“Why would you do something like this? Sam never did anything to you creeps!” You are sickened by Lucas and his corporation’s level of depravity. //Nothing is off limits to these guys!//

“Samantha is here because of your obstinance,” the Executive chides you. &quot;It is your fault, Taylor. Now is the time to take responsibility for your decisions. I have merely devoted some token resources on a whim of mine. You’re merely entertainment. This has already been very amusing and we’ve just started. Now, Taylor, are you going to behave or not?”

“I…” With one more glance at &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Samantha&quot; &quot;Sam desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, your will to resist crumbles away. //What have I gotten her into? I am such a fucking idiot… I can’t let them hurt Sam! How would I live with myself then? Uhh...// You are beginning to wonder if you or Sam will make it out of this alive. //How many people have these psychos murdered over the years?// you wonder. “I will do what you want,” you finally croak, defeated.

“Ahhh! That’s a much better attitude, Taylor,” Lucas encourages you with a pat on your head like some kind of pet.

“I hate you //so// fuckin’ much.”

Lucas chuckles. “You will hate me even more in a moment.”

“I can see why you and Deter were buddies. You both have serious mental illnesses.”

“Well, we do have similar… //appetites. // Since I am not fucking your friend right now, that means you are taking her place, right?”

//I have to endure… For Samantha’s sake!// You’d rather be lit on fire than let these Trans Corp goons do something untoward to Samantha. //If they… Oh fuck! I can’t think about that! I need to think of a way to get us the hell out of here!//

“I love that panicked look in your doe-ish eyes. Now bend over.” Lucas pulls down your underwear.

You grit your teeth in frustration. [[The only silver lining you can see is that it’s better that you suffer instead of Sam.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2550" name="The only consolation is that Mitch seems to be sharing your discomfort." tags="" position="3548,4237" size="100,100">“I’m sorry. You’re not a girl. You’re a //woman,//” Mitch apologies with exaggerated volume. 

With Mitch’s words, the cafe resumes its regular rhythm. Mitch frowns at you from across the table. “People might think I’m gay or you’re a trap or something if you don’t keep it down,” he says to you in a hushed voice.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/campuscoffee.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hey!” You moderate your volume. “I’m not a trap.”

“So you’re really a woman? Like completely?” he presses, his eyes growing wide.

“Uhh... “ You sigh. “Yeah, //completely.// I don’t really want to talk about this with you though.”

“That’s just amazing… The mind of a guy in the body of a girl as hot as you…?”

“I don’t like where you’re going with that line of thought.”

Mitch opens his mouth but he appears at a loss for words. Your conversation fades into silence. You chug the rest of your coffee and stand up to leave.

“W-Wait! I said I wanted you to give me a chance. There has to be something I can do for you.”

[[“Mitch, figure it out for yourself.”]]
[[“Mitch, I gave you your chance. Now please kindly fuck off and leave me alone like you promised.”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2551" name="“Mitch, figure it out for yourself.”" tags="" position="3468,4391" size="100,100">“That’s all you can say to me?”

“Yep! I don’t need anything from you. If you want to be nice for a change, that’s up to you. We all have to make tough decisions.” //I think everyone is in the same boat, including me… But some clearly have it tougher than others...// “This transformation stuff is new to me. So I have to figure things out too… like finding a way to change back.”

“You can’t change back!” a blushing Mitch objects.

“That’s not your choice!” you shoot back.

Mitch fades. “I uh… okay, I think I understand. I’ll give you some time to get settled and then we can try again.”

//Try again?//

“Mitch, if you become a decent person then maybe we can be friends.”

Mitch nods thoughtfully. “I… I’ll try. Thanks for having coffee with me, Taylor.”

//I think that was the first time I have ever heard him thank someone...//

“Yeah, thanks for the coffee.” //And the very awkward time!//

You leave Mitch behind and step out onto the street feeling light headed.

“Well…”
[[Surprisingly, that wasn’t completely terrible…]]

Maybe there is more to Mitch than meets the eye… 

You had largely written him off as an asshole but perhaps that notion was worthy of reconsideration. 

“Ahh, fuck. I have bigger problems than dealing with Mitch…” you remark as you look down at the foreign mounds protruding from your chest. “What the hell am I going to do now?”



Will Taylor find a way to return to his old self? Or will something or someone sidetrack his adventure?

//Well, at least I never have to do that again! The coffee will probably buy me enough time to find a way to change back!// you think optimistically.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2555" name="“Sure…”" tags="" position="13681,17944" size="100,100">You hesitate but relent under the pressure of Tim’s steady smile. //Tim is pretty funny. It might be fun to hang out again… as friends. It might pay to have some non drug induced fun for a bit.//

You exchange numbers while silently hoping Tim doesn’t get the wrong impression about you. 

//I hope I am not just the drunk slut of the week...// What if that was the type of woman Tim preferred?

You shout a thank you to Evan and then depart. By the time you make it home, the after effects of your overzealous night hit you hard.

You spend the next part of the day retching above the toilet. Afterwards, you feel like such a bag of crap that you just lie in bed until the evening.

Your thoughts wander. You think of your friends and how you’ve neglected them like an asshole. //I haven’t seen Drew in ages… Evan’s still nice to me, although he has been looking at me kinda weird… and there’s Tim.//

“Hmmm…?” Tim’s name conjures up a vivid recollection of your time in the basement. 

You rub your thighs together at the memory. “Mmmm! Yep! That was definitely too much!” //Too much pleasure...// Ahhh! C’mon, Taylor, snap out of it!”

“Oh man… I have a million and one things to do and here I am feeling sorry for myself and thinking about //guys.//” You wonder why it is so hard to get off your ass. “I need to find a cure, not laze around but…” //I just feel like shit!//  “I’ve been doing way too much drinking… I need to stop but…” Your hands start shaking slightly at the thought, out of nerves or possible withdrawal you cannot say.

[[You continue arguing with yourself for much of the day.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2556" name="“That’s probably not a great idea. Sorry!”" tags="" position="13831,17944" size="100,100">Tim’s smile sags. “I understand. No worries. Maybe I’ll see you around again?”

“Anything is possible,” you remark. “Maybe don’t mention this to Evan, if you can avoid bragging.”

“I can keep a secret.”

You thank Tim for his discretion and company and then head upstairs.

With a mumbled thank you for his hospitality, you stumble out of Evan’s house and make your way home.  You spend the next part of the day retching above the toilet.  Such a gross experience would normally make you abstain from drinking for an extended period.  Yet now, in the cold, stark reality of the day you find your sober time to be almost unbearable.  Although it seems disgusting, you go out and get drunk that very night, and the next as well.

You fade into a liver destroying but fun routine.

A month goes by and you find yourself rarely if ever bothering to attend class.

Near the end of October, you glance at your phone’s many missed messages and decide to ignore your friend&#39;s texts.

You look at your dwindling stash that you have tried unsuccessfully to ration.  Soon you are strung out, miserable and drugless...standing in front of a familiar doorstep.

[[Knock on the door]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2557" name="You continue arguing with yourself for much of the day." tags="" position="13681,18094" size="100,100">“Uggggggh! I wanna get high!” you whine as you curl up into the fetal position. “But I don’t wanna die… Ahh…” 

Tim pops into your mind again along with his black monster. “Maybe a natural high would be a worthy substitute until I get my head straight? No! I can’t do that… That isn’t //straight// at all!  Hwaahh… Maybe if I just sleep for six months I will turn back to the way I was... I don’t wanna be stuck like this!” you cry while obsessing over the cruel twists of fate that led you to the place in your life in which you now reside.

Einstein&#39;s definition of insanity seems to apply to your current behavior. “Damnit! I can’t keep making such dumb decisions! My life is a wreck and it will only get worse if I keep doing the same shit.”

//Bzzzt.// Your phone vibrates.

“Hey girl! What’s up?” reads a message from &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Tim&quot; &quot;Tim desc&quot;&gt;&gt;.

“Just bashing my head against a wall. I drank WAY too much last night,” you respond.

“At least drinking helped our paths to cross. Maybe we should try it together sometime.  I had a lot of fun last night!”

//I’m sure you did...// After thinking about it for a few moments, you realize that you did too, despite the awkward drunken spontaneity of the act.. //Can I admit that without coming off as promiscuous or worse?// 

You message Tim for a couple of hours, eager for the distraction. Tim’s self deprecating humor leaves you giggling long after the conversation ends.

When your fatigue finally catches up with you, you go to bed early, resolving to return to class the following morning.

At school, you spot &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Drew&quot; &quot;Drew (Drewdesc)&quot;&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt; standing outside Deter’s lecture hall.

A wide eyed Drew rushes up to you. “Taylor! I thought you disappeared! Or worse...”

“Nah, I’ve just been… dealing with shit,” you reply.

“Uh, I see. You missed the midterms though. Even if you do alright in the rest of the course you still might fail. Nearly the entire grade comes from the midterms and finals,” warns Drew.

“I know but I think I have more pressing issues than passing Deter’s exam,” you respond with a shrug.

Evan doesn’t buy your excuse. “Then why are you here?” he asks.

“I just need a change of pace.”

Evan mulls over your answer. “Fair enough. Welcome back!”

You spend much of the day with your best friends. The time is like a breath of fresh air blown into your fetid life.

A week passes by and you manage to distract yourself enough with friends and schooling [[that  your cravings begin to miraculously fade away.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2558" name="that  your cravings begin to miraculously fade away." tags="" position="13681,18244" size="100,100">Yet they return with a vengeance after a single text. “Want to go out and party tonight?” reads a message from Tim.

You find it difficult to respond. A few minutes later, Tim calls you.

“Hi,” you shyly answer the phone.

“Hey Taylor! Are you interested in coming out tonight? My friend already has a keg setup!” an excited Tim offers. “We always need more beautiful women around!”

Although you desperately want to go out drinking, you attempt to decline as politely as possible. “I’d like to join you… but I am trying to take a little break. I went a little overboard lately. I want to make it to thirty without getting a liver transplant if at all possible,” you joke.

“Heh. Well, there are other organs we could give a workout, if you’re game.”

Your face heats up as you visualize his meaning. “Uh… thanks, but pass.”

Tim is silent for about ten seconds. “Taylor, do you want to talk?”

You can’t hide your surprise. “Talk about what?”

“What’s eating you up? Sounds like you went on quite a bender. What are you trying to forget? Or who…? Did you have a bad break up?”

You sigh. 

“You don’t have to say if you don’t want to,” Tim continues. “But I know from experience, it always feels better getting things off your chest rather than keeping them bottled up inside.”

With charm, Tim manages to coax part of your story from you. You mention a certain spiky haired bully and how interacting with him started your trek down a slippery slope that you have now ridden nearly to the bottom on your ass. Of course, you omit the story of your initial transformation and the lengths to which you subsequently fell. //Tim probably already thinks I am a bit nuts… I really don’t want to scare him away.//

Tim listens patiently to your story, offering comfort and concern where necessary.

“...And so that’s how I ended up in the basement,” you conclude.

“Wow… I feel bad for offering to take you to that party.”

“It’s not your fault. It’s mine mostly…” //My stupidity and lack of self control...//

“It sounds more like Mitch’s to me. I’ve seen him around campus. That guy is a dirtbag. I’m sorry you had to go through all that.” 

You find that Tim’s advice was indeed beneficial. Venting a bit did in fact make you feel better. 

Your conversation meanders to happier topics. At the end, Tim offers to buy you lunch.

After using Tim as an emotional support blanket for an hour, you find it difficult to refuse.

The next day, [[you meet Tim for lunch.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2559" name="you meet Tim for lunch." tags="" position="13681,18394" size="100,100">You arrive early outside the coffee and sandwich shop located just off campus but Tim beats you there. You spot the lean man near the back of the sitting area.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/coffeeshop.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hi, Tim.”

Instead of responding verbally, Tim sweeps you up in a hug.

Wide eyed, you are held in Tim’s strong arms. Just as your embarrassment grows to critical levels, Tim sets you back down.

“Sorry, I thought you looked like you could use a pick-me-up.”

“Not literally…”

“You’re pretty light.”

“Not for long. I’m hungry!”

“Me too.”

After a couple of minutes, your food arrives.

You stuff your face with gusto until you notice Tim staring at you.

Cheeks stuffed like a chipmunk, you chew and swallow as your face reddens. 

“What?”

“Nothing! I like a girl with a big appetite.”

You almost laugh. //I guess I’m not very ladylike.// You’ve seen a lot of women eat like a bird, whereas you are more like a messy child.

Tim teases you throughout the meal but you find his good natured ribbing to be more entertaining than annoying. At the end of the meal Tim covers the check and invites you to join him at a small party later in the evening.

“Are you done your detox?” Tim asks you.

//Well, he did buy me lunch and it might be fun… I’ll just have to take it easy.//

[[It is hard to refuse Tim’s friendly smile.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2560" name="It is hard to refuse Tim’s friendly smile." tags="" position="13681,18544" size="100,100">“Yeah, I think I might enjoy a night out. We’ll just take it easy, okay?”

“Of course!”

You return to class but you have other things on your mind. Inconsequential decisions gnaw at you. //What am I going to wear tonight? Ahh, damnit! Why does that even matter?!//

You decide to dress as casually as possible. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/casual.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
An hour later, you head to the party side by side with &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Tim&quot; &quot;Tim desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, walking up to a house that is vibrating from the sound of music blasting within. 

Your friend is greeted by a grinning guy with a mohawk. “Tim my man!” 

You are introduced to a whirlwind of people. Their names slip from your mind seconds after introductions.

Tim seems to know everybody. His gregarious attitude attracts a number of curious partiers but he never takes his big brown eyes off of you for long. 

Tim points to a table loaded with various bottles of booze and looks at you inquiringly.

[[“Alright, maybe just one!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2561" name="“Alright, maybe just one!”" tags="" position="13681,18694" size="100,100">Tim shoots you a reassuring smile. “Sure thing! No pressure.”

“Just something light please. Maybe I will sip on something else later.”

Tim offers you a wine cooler with a knowing smile. It tastes delicious without any hint of alcohol.

You drink sparingly and find that you have fun even without the additional fogginess.

Aside from a few initial shots, Tim mirrors your abstention from alcohol.

Instead of drinking, you and Tim watch the other intoxicated guests make fools of themselves. People watching is especially entertaining with a witty friend.

Tim points to a dancing couple. “I don’t think they are going to make it on //Dancing with the Stars//,” he jokes.

“I’m glad I’m not drunk otherwise I might be out there too.”

“Aww, it’s a shame I missed that.”

“Nah, I probably make those two look graceful…” you joke.

“Well, maybe later you could show me some moves. I promise not to laugh.”

“Fat chance of that.”

After a few laughs, Tim begins to tell you stories of his travels across South America and Africa. He is so well travelled and experienced despite your similar ages that you can’t help but see him in a new light.

When you catch each other’s eye you notice it takes you progressively longer to look away.

As a full moon lights up a pitch black sky, Tim corrals you in a corner of the yard. 

Tim leans in for a kiss and you instinctively pull away, nearly knocking over a cup of lemonade.

&quot;Who keeps leaving all these random cups of lemonade all over the place?&quot; you wonder as you pick up the cup.

&quot;Uhh, Taylor … that&#39;s not lemonade...&quot;

“Huh?  ……………….. //GROSS!!!//”  You drop the cup to the ground and spill its contents all over Tim’s shoes.

Tim looks down, clearly rendered speechless. This is the same moment you realize Tim’s footwear looks surprisingly nice. Most people on campus wear cheap sneakers… but not Tim. //Oh man, I hope he wasn’t just dressing up for me and I didn’t even notice.//

[[You begin to profusely apologize.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2562" name="You begin to profusely apologize." tags="" position="13681,18844" size="100,100">“I’m so sorry!”

“My feet are //wet//…”

“Ahh, I already said I’m sorry! Don’t make me feel even worse! Who the fuck would do something so disgusting anyway?”

“Someone who really had to go,” Tim replies with a straight face that quickly breaks into laughter. “Well, Taylor, there is one way you could make it up to me.”

“Sure! Anything except buying you a new pair. Those loafers or whatever the fuck look really expensive.”

“I can get behind that.”

“So what do you want?”

“A kiss. Come here.”

“A //k-kiss!?// I--”

Before you can finish your sentence, Tim draws you in. Your lips collide and all you can mutter is a faint protest that quickly changes tone.

“MmmmmMM! Mmm… Maahh...”

“You’re so hot,” Tim whispers, his voice low and throaty, almost a growl.

“I…” //I am oddly warm…// You open your mouth to speak but your words are lost as Tim renews his attempt to kiss you into submission.  “MmMmm!!”

//Wait! I’m a dude… kissing another guy! And it’s making me feel all weird! Why is this happening to me?!// Every second you stay silent is a lie by omission but now your mouth is occupied while it seems to take all your concentration to keep yourself upright. //Would Tim be kissing me if he knew who… what I am? Ah, fuck! It’s not like I even know the answers to those questions myself anymore!//

Your body temperature continues to increase while delightful tingles spread throughout your body. Your anxiety seems to pool in your guts but instead of making you ill, it just sinks lower and lower until it [[ignites a series of impulses and urges that you have been trying to suppress when you are around Tim.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2563" name="ignites a series of impulses and urges that you have been trying to suppress when you are around Tim." tags="" position="13681,18994" size="100,100">As Tim continues to make out with you, you’re soon almost literally tongue tied. “Mfaahh.. Mm… Tim…”

“I like the shy act, Taylor. It’s //really// turning me on.”

//It’s not an act!// you fret.

Tim leans back and even in the poor lighting of the backyard, you can clearly see Tim’s bulge.

Tim’s kisses become more urgent while big hands cup your modest breasts. He gives each a playful yet gentle squeeze.

You try in vain to push him back but, as your hand touches Tim’s lean stomach, your fingers spread out in tacit admiration of the young man’s six pack.

//Whoa! C’mon, Taylor! Focus!//

But the only real thing to focus on is your interaction with Tim. 

Tim’s tongue is dancing in your mouth. You feel your mind become more addled by the moment.

You and your dark paramour make out until you are light headed and panting. 

“Do you want to get out of here?” Tim asks you.

//Translation: do you want to go home and fuck?//

You let Tim lead you back to Evan’s place.

You feel a bit naughty as you slip past your friend’s door and into Tim’s room.

As soon as you are behind closed doors, Tim begins to tug at your shirt and you don’t resist as he pulls it over your head.

You can’t help but laugh at Tim’s reaction as your bare breasts bounce free.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/smiley.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Holy shit! You aren’t even wearing a bra! You have the cutest little perky boobs I’ve ever seen!” he gasps.

//Little?! They seem huge to me! Oh man, what do I do now? This is already out of control...// You don’t even have the excuse of alcohol. //Well, I guess I’m already topless…// It would be a shame to disappoint Tim after having come so far.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tstrip.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You take a step back and drop your panties, doing your best to ignore the obvious wet stain down their center.

[[Tim pulls you to the bed and your soft body meets his dark, toned flesh.]]

As you inhale the scent of his cologne-masked sweat, you are seized by a spell of dizziness.

You fall back on the bed, watching with unhidden interest as Tim pulls off his underwear, revealing his enormous penis.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tim3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your guts and nethers clench in anticipation. 

“Taylor, please help me,” Tim requests.

You roll onto your stomach, and meet the charge as Tim shuffles forward. His giant one eyed monster stares you in the face.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timpresuck.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Holy fuck, that thing is just… wow...// Your mouth begins to water. You find yourself drawn towards Tim’s groin and the thing that both horrifies, fascinates, and arouses you at the same time.

“Oh…” [[Instead of protesting or delaying the inevitable, you stick out your tongue.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2567" name="Instead of protesting or delaying the inevitable, you stick out your tongue." tags="" position="13606,19444" size="100,100">Tim moves forward and fills your throat. You lick the underside of his shaft, tasting Tim’s salty,  manly tang as he slides deeper into your body.

After probing the limits of your throat, Tim withdraws, giving you a chance to service him more properly.

After giving him a few soft pumps, you are weirded out by how small your hands appear against Tim’s premium specimen of manhood.

You focus on the tip of the penis while looking Tim in the eyes. //It’s better that than looking at this thing! Ahhh! I am sucking a dick again and it’s awesome… Fuck my life...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timblow.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmmm…” Tim’s cock twitches in your mouth as you roll your tongue over his weeping glans. With an glazed eyes and ear splitting grin, Tim clearly revels in your erotic display. 

“Mgahh… Mmmmah! Gough!” You gag on a big black cock for the next fifteen minutes, eager to make Tim feel as good as possible.

//Om… Om… Kahh… Mmmm...//

With each rise and fall of your head, you sink deeper down your lover’s dark shaft. His enlarged glans blocks your airpipe but you don’t mind, [[letting Tim treat your throat like a fuck toy.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2568" name="letting Tim treat your throat like a fuck toy." tags="" position="13606,19594" size="100,100">It’s hard not to choke the moment Tim hits the back of your throat but through force of sheer will, you’re able to take the rigid object even deeper than you thought possible.

With Tim’s hand on the back of your head urging you forward, you are able to choke down the last few inches.

“Hwayy… Hrrch…”

You can’t breathe but it feels good to have accomplished the near impossible.

Tim looks down at you adoringly. “I can’t believe you can take it all. Many girls don’t like to give me head because I’m so big. I worry I might hurt you if we get a bit rough.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytimdeep.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The experiences of the last few months have changed you irreparably and awakened a slough of new feelings and urges.

“Fwaaahhhh! Ahhh!” you gasp as Tim pulls back and allows you a respite. “Hwaah… I like it a little bit rough,” you breathlessly admit.

“Oh babe, that’s exactly what I want to hear!” Tim cheers as he plunges back into your mouth.

You taste sour precum but the flavor is soon lost in your slobbery attempt to keep up with Tim’s efforts.

Eager to please Tim, you let the young man absolutely demolish your throat.

“Gah Omph… Mwgah… Guhh!”

//Tim is cool… but why am I letting another guy fuck my throat like this?// You agreed to all this. It is plain you desire this even if you are not completely certain why.

After a short time, your jaw feels like it is about to dislocate at any moment yet still the black snake plunges deeper into your mouth, until he finally begins to erupt and unleash his milky venom.

“Uhhhh! Here it comes babe!” Tim informs you a second late with a succession of grunts.

Spots fill your vision but still you struggle to suppress your gag reflex as several huge spurts of cum shoot down your throat. Tim swells as he ejaculates and you experience every convulsion from a new perspective.

“UMMMM!! Gah!”

//Sploooot!//

“Hwwaaahhhhh! You gasp when your mouth is finally free. Your heart and lungs desperately attempt to return your body to equilibrium but you are so far into your sexual frenzy that such a thing is impossible.

“Haah… Hahh… Hoo… Hwah...” you pant.

All of Tim’s semen is in your belly. [[You curse your silent disappointment that you barely got to taste any.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2569" name="You curse your silent disappointment that you barely got to taste any." tags="" position="13606,19744" size="100,100">“Let’s do it, Taylor.”

Not trusting your voice, you just nod. You are a slave to your new instincts.

Tim pushes your shoulder back and you tumble into bed.

Unable to deny what’s coming, you spread your legs and Tim wastes no time before diving on top of you.

He seems eager to reciprocate and make you feel good too. Tim’s fingers flash forward. A single finger probes your entrance, then two followed by a third that stretches you to your limit.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/timfinger.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Tim proceeds to finger fuck you until the sounds of your pleasure echo throughout the room.

“Uhhhhnnn!”

//Schlick-schlick-scccclliiick!//

He finds the ridge lining the roof of your vaginal canal and brushes the tips of his fingers over it [[until you are trembling and so wet that you are dripping onto the bed sheets.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2570" name="until you are trembling and so wet that you are dripping onto the bed sheets." tags="" position="13606,19894" size="100,100">He rubs against you for a long, agonizing moment before his huge cock splits you apart, filling you to your deepest recesses in one swift thrust.

“HNNNNNNNGHHH!” you cry out as Tim rearranges your internals.

//Oh my god! Fuuuuck… I’m at like a hundred and ten percent capacity here!//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/timtaypovdeep.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“You’re so hot!” Tim praises you. “This this the hottest, wettest pussy I’ve ever fucked! I can’t believe how tightly you are gripping me.”

“Hnnnnn!” You barely even hear Tim’s words, for you are occupied with other much more powerful sensations.

Tim begins to move and soon his dick is a blur, surging in and out of your weeping pussy.

“Hhhhhhhhhhhaayyyyaaahh!”

//This is too fucking much! I’m being torn apart! And it’s-- it’s… glorious.//

“Oh my goooood, I’m cumming!” you wail as your shuddering body struggles to accept more of Tim’s immense girth.

You let your own orgasm sweep over you, cumming on Tim’s huge dick.

“Yeessss! More!” you cry.

Tim rolls forward on top of you while continuing to pound your pussy into oblivion.

[[Obscenely wet sex sounds echo througout Tim’s room… and probably the whole house.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2571" name="Obscenely wet sex sounds echo througout Tim’s room… and probably the whole house." tags="" position="13606,20044" size="100,100">//Fwap-fap-fap-fwap-fwap-FWAP!//

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Aaahhhh!” Although you bite your lip, you still end up crying out in time with Tim’s rapid thrusts.

Tim fucks you into oblivion and back again.

“Ahhhhhh! Yumm… MmmMM! Tim I love the way you fuck me!”

You really hope Evan doesn’t accidentally overhear your moans. As if reading your mind, Tim begins to kiss you while increasing the pace of his thrusts.

Mouth and pussy occupied, you just writhe in a state of ecstasy.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timfuckkiss.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmmm....”

Tim gives you exactly what you need. He bangs you with almost animalistic passion until you are launched into a succession of delightfully cycling orgasms.

You put a hand on Tim’s heaving chest. “I want it from behind.”

You decouple and then point your cute butt towards Tim. He lines up and is inside you a second later.

“Pull my hair! Fuck me harder! Hnnnn… Y-yeeeeaasss! Fuck yeeeesss!” you squeal as your head nearly smacks against the headboard.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timdoggyhair.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After a lengthy session joined together, the two of you cum at the same time. Your insides are painted with semen while your own juices run down your legs.

You collapse next to Tim. Your eyes fall on weeping white cum and then on Tim’s spent cock. The contrast of his dark skin against your light is strikingly beautiful. You feel exhausted and content.  //Maybe our offspring would be dalmatians!// you mentally joke. The odd chain of thought leads you to feel overly self conscious.  

//Our… offspring… means I would be the one that has to…. NOPE!  Fuck that, I am never having kids!//

“At least not while I am like this…” you murmur.

The only bizarre comfort is that Tim’s huge cock has bored you out enough that a having a baby probably isn’t much of a stretch.

“Oh damn! Why am I thinking about this stuff?!” you fret.

After Tim falls asleep, you pry yourself away from him and retrieve your scattered clothing before slipping away. As you pass by Evan’s door you overhear him watching TV inside.

[[You flee the house like the scene of a crime.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2572" name="You flee the house like the scene of a crime." tags="" position="13606,20194" size="100,100">Once you are home you sink back into a funk. After a quick shower you sleep most of the day away. You wake up late in the evening, feeling no better than when you went to bed.

The reality of your situation gnaws at you like a persistent, starving dog.

//Speaking of starving dogs...//

You head the fridge and find it essentially empty. //That’s right, I haven’t done much shopping lately.// As you open random cupboards, you find nothing appetizing… until you come to a hidden bottle of vodka.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/vodka.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
It is hard to deny that you perk up at the discovery. //I was so good lately… well, except for what happened with Tim… but maybe that wasn’t the worst thing in the world.// 

“I can just have one!” You scrounge up a package of fruit juice crystals and whisk up a batch of spiked punch.

You watch a movie and sip far too much punch.

“Daaaaaaaaamn…. I am fwuckin’ hammad!” You bite your lip as you look at your cell phone. Your face flushes as you think about Tim.

[[Text Tim]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2573" name="Text Tim" tags="" position="13606,20344" size="100,100">“Come fuck me please,” you message Tim.

Tim takes your heavy handed hint and arrives within twenty minutes.

That night you throw all pretense aside as you undergo a sexual awakening.

Having sex with Mitch was disgusting but with Tim you have less conflicting feelings.

“Uhhh! Yeeahh! Mmph! Mm! Mmph!”

Tim dispels all your empty feelings. The void in your heart and loins is filled... repeatedly.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timkillingtime.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You get absolutely plowed by Tim and love every second of it. Those seconds tick away into hours and you relish the descent.

“Hnnnnnn! Hhhhn! This is too much for me! //It hurts!//” you cry out.

As soon as you convey your feelings to Tim he stops moving. He looks at you with concern.

“Should I stop?”

You don’t want to spoil Tim’s good time… or your own. “No! It’s fine. I like it to hurt a little bit. Fuck. Me. Harder!” you command.

“Ohhh…” Tim’s grin returns. He rushes to fulfill your order, eagerly stuffing you full of his big, black cock. He knocks against your uterus. He rides you wild and raw until you fade back into the beckoning light at the edge of your vision. Your eyes roll back in your head as you orgasm, convulsing on a man’s dick.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timtoomuchbbc.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After hours of sex Tim suddenly asks you a weird question.  “You love the BBC, don’t you, Taylor?”

“Uhhh, I guess? [[They are kinda biased but sometimes they make sweet documentaries.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2574" name="They are kinda biased but sometimes they make sweet documentaries." tags="" position="13606,20494" size="100,100">Tim blinks.  “Huh?  I meant //this// BBC,” Tim corrects you, pointing at his rapidly swelling dick.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/timpov.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Err….”  You sigh but then shrug and nod.  “That’s //okay// too, I guess,” you admit in a voice just above a whisper.

Your mouth begins to salivate at the sight of Tim’s enormous cock.

You know there is no one who could fill you up quite like Tim can.

You have a void in your life and body. Tim fills it completely… at least for the moment.

“Just lie down on the bed there and point that cute butt towards me,” Tim instructs you.  “I will do all the //hard// work,” your black stallion assures you.

You look at his fully erect black, veiny cock, a huge, prime specimen of manhood.  Hard doesn’t even begin to describe its current state. “Uh….”  //He just looks at me and becomes like that?  So I have to take responsibility...right?  Ahh…  What the heck has gotten into me lately?//

You glance between Tim’s massive penis and the bed.  //Am I really even considering this… again?  Last time really hurt a lot before it improved....//  Tim’s dick was just too big, the sensible thing would be to refuse to take that monster inside you.

Yet, you cannot seem to draw your eyes away from it.  [[You are admittedly a bit curious and more than a bit horny.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2575" name="You are admittedly a bit curious and more than a bit horny." tags="" position="13606,20644" size="100,100">“Alright Taylor, let’s //fuck!//”

With one impressive thrust, Tim buries his huge black cock inside you.  He stretches you apart with his significant girth.  You are amazed when he manages to push nearly the entire length inside you.  You can feel him probing against the opening of your uterus, a tickling dull sensation that urges you simultaneously to stop and continue.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/timtayextradeep.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Uhhnn…  This is too much!” you protest.  Yet as you look down at where you are joined, Tim pushes even harder and you are rewarded with the stinging kiss of a deep internal pain.

“Hahh… Hahh…” a sweaty Tim pants. “I still can’t believe you can take it all!”

“Me either…”  You are fairly certain you will never be penetrated so deeply ever again.  You are impaled on Tim’s manhood and barely able to move.  One of the weirdest things about this experience, is that after Tim begins to slowly move, you find the dominant sense of pain begin to fade.  After a few minutes, to your astonishment, you find it doesn’t even hurt at all.

As Tim withdraws and plunges back into you, you see that your juices have now completely coated his black flesh.  He slides in and out of you with greater ease.

Your mind is going blank.

“Mmmmmmmm…..”  //I could get used to this,// you think as you passively receive ever greater levels of pleasure, emanating from the pistoning member in your groin.

Tim grabs your arms and pulls them behind you.  With one giant hand holding your tiny wrists together and the other on your hip, urging you onto Tim’s pounding cock with greater force, you are lost in a moment at the apex of pleasure.

After cumming your brains out, you pass out and sleep the entire day away, [[nestled next to Tim like a glorious yin and yang.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2576" name="nestled next to Tim like a glorious yin and yang." tags="" position="13606,20794" size="100,100">The next morning you wake up with a splitting headache.  You are a bit disappointed in yourself as you gently untangle your sweaty limbs from Tim’s. //These benders are really getting out of control. I need to stop drinking and…// Your eyes fall on Tim’s sleeping figure. //I might be able to quit drinking but it might be even harder to quit Tim.// It takes you nearly a frantic minute of searching before you find most of your clothes.  

You creep downstairs as quietly as possible but pause as the bright light from the kitchen window hits you in the eyes.

As you search for a morsel of something edible, you become conscious of a profound soreness. It is apparent that you now walk with a slight limp and a dull deep-seated pain.  You try and think of anything except the previous night and the cause of that soreness but find that task to be nearly impossible.

Your mind inevitably wanders. //Uhh….//  You recall in vivid detail the way it felt as Tim plunged in and out of you. Sex with Mitch always felt dirty and wrong despite the pleasure it afforded you. But when you sleep with Tim, you get the sex without many of the downsides.

//The only problem is me. What the fuck is going on in this stupid addled brain of mine?!// You know that you should be doing //something.// You’re just not quite sure what that “something” should be.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lucasfingered.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnn!!” you squeal as Lucas finger fucks you to insanity and beyond.

//Schlick-schlick-schlick! Shllllliiiick!//

“Noooo! Huuuaah!” you gasp as the pressure inside you builds to critical levels. 

You are absolutely disgusted by the orgasm he gives you. It makes you feel //tainted.//

//It’s just physical response… It’s out of my control!// you tell yourself, praying that your rationalizations aren’t as hollow as you now feel.

You are pushed forward onto a nearby desk. //I have to endure… I can’t let them rape Sam!//

Lucas pays no attention to your panic. Your cruel captor mounts you from behind, his fully engorged member plowing into your body with one swift, clean motion.

“Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hnnnnnnnnhghhhgaaaaaahhhh-ffffuuuuckk!”

While Lucas thoroughly reshapes your insides, you can do nothing except brace yourself and hold on for dear life.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/corpbanged.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“You’re a grade A psychopath,” you say to Lucas once he is done unloading all over your backside.

Lucas shrugs and nods.

[[After Lucas is finished with you, you are returned to your cell under escort.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2578" name="After Lucas is finished with you, you are returned to your cell under escort." tags="" position="8994,17644" size="100,100">You sit and brood in silence for a long time. //I wonder if there is a chance we could get rescued? Ah, how unlikely is that?!// You curse your powerlessness and wishful thinking.

Eventually you fall asleep on your rock hard cot, your last waking thoughts consisting of nothing except sadness and rage.

You wake to a metallic vibrating sound.

“Hello there!” &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Victoria&quot; &quot;Victoria desc&quot;&gt;&gt; cheerfully greets you through the bars of your cell. 

Startled, you turn to face Victoria and are shocked at the concentration of her //strange perfume//. The alluring fragrance washes over you, hitting you like a slap across the face. //Is that perfume or are those her overpowered pheromones!?// The young woman exudes command and control. You can almost physically feel Victoria’s sensual aura coil around your throat. 

“What do you want with me?” You cough.

“I am a Special Director based in Human Resources,” Victoria explains, her bright blue unblinking eyes glinting with obsessive interest.

“Uh huh… Phew… Human resources?” Even speaking with Victoria is enough to make you light headed. “What do you want from me?”

“I am here to //train// you!” Victoria answers.

You bite your tongue and moderate your language. //If I antagonize them then they will retaliate… // “Just please don’t hurt Sam,” you plead.

“We won’t harm a hair on her pretty little red head… as long as you are suitably obedient, that is. If you try and rock the boat, well she might just be tossed overboard to save a bit of weight, if you catch my meaning.”

Gulping, you nod weakly. Although you fear to speak, you do so anyway. [[“What kind of training am I supposed to do?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2579" name="“What kind of training am I supposed to do?”" tags="" position="8994,17794" size="100,100">Victoria giggles and makes her next words sound ominous. “We are going to start with some //affirmations//.” 

“Affirmations?”

“That’s right. Think of this as a little bit of //self-help.// Everything we do is for your own benefit, even if it doesn’t seem like it at first,” the slender woman assures you. Victoria shouts down the hallway. “Guard! Close the vents!” she orders. Turning back to you, Victoria looks down at you like an eagle about to spear a mouse upon its talons, and more for amusement than sustenance. 

//Crrreeeeee! Chk!//

The vents above snap close and you get another dose of Victoria’s strange power. The temperature in the room seems to ratchet up, dragging your own body along with it. //Or is it the other way around?// you wonder as you fan your reddening skin. Victoria’s intoxicating scent fills every nook and cranny of your cell, permeating beyond your nostrils and soaking into every fiber of your being. Tall and proud, Victoria imperiously stands before you until you struggle to breathe, choking on her delightful poison. You desperately try to cover your mouth but find yourself already too far gone for the act to make any noticeable difference.

In less than a minute, your “insurmountable” will is suppressed.

“Repeat after me!” Victoria’s command cuts through your daze. “I am property of Trans Corp International.”

You grit your teeth, silently letting off a litany of choice cuss words while vowing eternal vengeance.

“I… am... “ you begin, each word drawn out like a pulled tooth. “... property of Trans Corp International,” you pledge. Although they are just words, their utterance nearly causes you physical pain.

“Amazing!” Victoria cheers for you. “See how easy that was? Now say it again with more gusto. Make me believe you! You should be //happy.// Trust me, this will be a liberating experience.”

“I am property of Trans Corp International,” you repeat.

“Again!” [[Victoria’s voice cracks like a whip. “I don’t believe you!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2580" name="Victoria’s voice cracks like a whip. “I don’t believe you!”" tags="" position="8994,17944" size="100,100">You repeat your pledge //thousands of times// until you feel like you are lost. “Huahh… I am property of Trans Corp International...” you mumble.

“That’s right,” Victoria agrees. “You’re just a piece of property. It is good to internalize the truth. I think you’re starting to get it. Now take another deep breath. Tell me: who do you belong to?”

Suddenly you are confused, as if your mind had been reduced to pablum. You just want to please Victoria and give the slender beauty exactly what she wants.

“Taylor. To whom do you belong?”

“T-to you…?”

Victoria giggles. “No, silly. Didn’t you learn anything from all those affirmations? We belong to the company. Lucas Ferret is our boss. You’re still in training, so I’ll let you off the hook this time since I can clearly see your inner potential.”

Three days pass in much the same manner. You sit alone all day until Victoria arrives to indoctrinate you.

As strange as it is, a part of you is happy when Victoria and her heady scent return. She is the only distraction from your misery and overactive conscious that you have. //Being around Victoria is like a drug… Fuck, I need to be careful… I feel like I am losing it here!//

On the fourth day following your awakening, [[Lucas appears to taunt you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2581" name="Lucas appears to taunt you." tags="" position="8994,18094" size="100,100">Seeing the executive’s smug face makes you want to claw his eyes out but you’re far too exhausted. Although you stand ostensibly free, your hands feel like they are tied tightly behind your back. 

“How have you been, Taylor?” Lucas asks you.

Your anger overflows. “Terrible! You keep sending your witch after me!”

“My //witch?//” Lucas ponders. “Ah, //Victoria//.” The old man’s brow furrows for a moment before his face relaxes and regains its usual placid smugness. “You two have a fair bit in common,” Lucas asserts.

“Tck! I doubt that. She’s like a drone! I won’t succumb to her lame pheromone brainwashing or whatever the hell it is you’re trying to accomplish! Fuck you and Victoria!”

“I am saddened that you still feel the need to be so rude. Victoria is very useful… and she serves as a potent reminder.” Lucas’ tone changes during the second half of his statement.

You lick your suddenly dry lips. “A reminder?”

“//Victor Stroblekhov// was a thorn in my side for decades. He once considered himself untouchable and led our chief corporate rival, but that entity has long since absorbed into our mother company. Victor was an angry man with far too much ambition but now that //she// is Victoria, we are both much happier, of that I can assure you.”

//Wait. What? Victoria is a fuckin’ dude?!//

“You changed him?”

“Just like I am changing you. You’re mine, Taylor. Even your soul belongs to my company. I will do with you as I please and I will make you into whatever I want. Your nanites are difficult to manufacture, so I can’t just waste you-especially not when you’re this much fun to play with!” he explains.

“I am not a resource!” you protest.

Lucas chuckles, showing his obvious disagreement with your statement.

“How is Sam?”

“She’s fine. For now. Although perhaps she deserves a beating in recompense for your sassy mouth.”

“Nooo! Please! I’m sorry! I won’t swear anymore!” you plead.

“Taylor, you’re like an obnoxious songbird. You’re so loud and vulgar while still being frail and insignificant enough that I could crush you with a single hand.”

After a bit of pointless banter, you are again left alone to contemplate your fate.

//[[Fuck, if even this Victor guy lost to Lucas how the hell am I going to get out of here and save Sam?!]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2582" name="Fuck, if even this Victor guy lost to Lucas how the hell am I going to get out of here and save Sam?!" tags="" position="8994,18244" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Victoria&quot; &quot;Victoria desc&quot;&gt;&gt; -// Victor//, eventually comes to train you.

“Take off your clothes,” she casually orders you.

You hesitate. //Maybe Victor still exists somewhere inside Victoria’s mind...// Was there a small chance you could gain Victoria as an ally? //But how the hell can I undo years of brainwashing from this position!?//

Your hopes fade even further as you look into Victoria’s unblinking blue eyes. They shine with a fervent reflective gleam, the kind you have seen on doorstep preachers. Victoria raises an eyebrow while smiling impishly. “Well?”

//Victor might as well be dead!// It is nearly impossible to look at the young woman in front of you and think of her as anything except Lucas’ puppet.

“Huaah… Hah…” Every breath makes you woozy.

//It’s these damn… pheromones...//

You feel so dizzy that standing upright is becoming more difficult by the second.

“What’s the hold up!?” Victoria snaps. “It’s not that hard, Taylor! We will need to work on your obedience score.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victoriatop.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
To your surprise, [[Victoria pulls her own top over her head, as if to demonstrate the inconsequentiality of the act.]]

“Taaake-off-your-clothes, Taylor! I will not ask again.”

//No. I won’t!// “But…” //I REALLY want to! Oh man, I’m falling under her influence! And… And… It feels … pretty nice.//

“Mmmm…” You shake your head sleepily. //No! Snap out of it!// “Mmmm…”

“Thatta girl!” Victoria encourages you.

Your clothes slip away, freeing you of their restricting burden.

It’s as if there is a noose around your neck, leading you to your destruction. You are a slave to Victoria’s beck and call, captivated by her beauty and a persistent, all-consuming desire to please.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/taytopless2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Very nice. You’re //almost// as beautiful as I am.” The svelte beauty taps her lips thoughtfully. “Mm. Turn around, [[I want to see your backside.]]”

//No, this isn’t right!// a voice from within you frantically whispers. But it’s too late. You’re on a collision course with an iceberg and you can’t manage to find a brake or change course.

Head swaying, you look to Victoria. “What are you doing to me?”

“I’m just giving you a nudge. Lucas said you were quite //naughty// earlier. Do we need to do more affirmations, Taylor?”

“No! Please!”

“Or maybe you’d prefer if Sam underwent the same process in your stead?”

“NOO! Don’t do that! Please, Victoria! I’m here. I’m at your mercy!”

“Hmm. Maybe there is another way. If you make me feel good, I might just give you a bit of leniency. Just breathe in deeply and do what comes natural to you,” Victoria urges you.

The perfume-like pheromones become so intense that your eyes begin to water.

“Hrrk!” Your breath catches in your throat. //I’ve got to do something! I’m going to die here!// “Hhhhhhhckkkkkk!!!” you choke.

Drew takes one look at you and his jaw drops almost to the floor. Before Drew’s eyes can pop completely out of his head, you begin to show off your season themed costume.

“T-Taylor!?”

“Merry fuckin’ Christmas, Drew!”

“You too…”

“Haha! Like what you see?”

&quot;T-This is the best Christmas ever!” Drew stutters, his eyes wide with interest.

Drew wastes no time considering your invitation. With a blush nearly matching the same red shade as your outfit, you move in to tease Drew. That teasing quickly gets out of hand.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bustyxmas.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You make out with Drew, each kiss is sloppier and more urgent than the last.

You reach out and touch his groin. With a zip and a few delicate tugs, Drew’s rigid cock springs free.

You giggle as you stroke Drew’s cock, pleased at the reaction you have invoked.

Drew reciprocates and runs his fingers down your delicate cleft. Drew’s thick fingers probe your moistening pussy. It doesn’t take much before you lose it.

“Mmmm!”  //Damn… Was that a mini orgasm!? Mmmm! I’m still so horny...//

[[Drew pushes you over and dives between your legs.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2586" name="Drew pushes you over and dives between your legs." tags="" position="10399,36888" size="100,100">Drew laps at you like a lollipop about to expire. //Slpp. Slick. Schlick. Schlick.//

You enjoy the lovely sensations as Drew tongues your clit and then presses it as deep inside your vagina as possible.

“Mmmm! Mmmphh! Taylor, you taste //so// good.”

“Shut up, I don’t want to hear that!”

Drew lowers his face back to your groin.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bustyxmas4.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmm! Mwaah! Oh-my-god! Drew! Right therrrrreeeaaahhh!~” you wail.

Drew rocks your world with his cunnilingus skills. //I bet he read a fucking book about it… Err, multiple books,// you guess.

After cumming your brains out, Drew continues to tongue your sensitive groin.  He then rises, grinning, to bring your own flavors to your lips. 

You have passed the point of caring. You return the kiss. //Passionately.// It’s Christmas, so you’re into the spirit of sharing love.

“Mmmmmmmmm… Drew...” [[Your night of Christmas love with Drew continues…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2587" name="Your night of Christmas love with Drew continues…" tags="" position="10399,37038" size="100,100">Drew kisses you until you are breathlessly forced to turn away. Instead of turning back to face him, you slink forward even more, raising your butt in the air so that Drew can get a prime view of your feminine offerings. //Well, I am pretty much the gift in this situation...// The objectification doesn’t bother you, in fact the opposite seems true: you find that the situation turns you on.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bustyxmas2.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
To your surprise, Drew abandons foreplay and mounts you from behind.

“Taaaylor! I can’t take it anymore!”

With minimal fumbling, Drew lances inside you. With your pussy tightly gripping your best friend’s manhood, Drew then proceeds to fuck you from behind.

Drew huffs and puffs as he stuffs you. You love every second of it. Drew’s stamina surprises you.

//Fwap-fwap. Hwap. Wap-wap.// “Huh! Huh! Huuuah!”

As Drew’s dick rams in and out of you, your fingers find your clit and begin to rub delicate circles around its slick, engorged flesh.

“Hnnnn! Yes! Right there!”

The dual interplay, clitoral and vaginal drives you wild, [[quickly throwing you off the abyss into a sea of pleasure.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2588" name="quickly throwing you off the abyss into a sea of pleasure." tags="" position="10399,37188" size="100,100">You spend most of Christmas day riding cock. You revel in your sexual power and control as you perfect your cowgirl technique. As your hips rise and fall, you find yourself seeking your own pleasure. 

With your hands on Drew’s belly, you manage to control exactly how much of him to take inside you. You find the //perfect// spot and then use your own movements to thoroughly explore that area.

You love the way Drew feels inside you.  //Ahhh! Drew’s dick feels too good!//

Drew seems to share a similar opinion about your own flesh. “Taaaylor…” a sweaty Drew moans your name as he seeks his biological imperative deep inside you.

“Huuah! Kyah! Fnn… Unnn!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bustyxmas3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Fwap-wap-wap-wap-WAP! WAP! WAP!//

“Mmmm! Shit yeah! Merry Christmas… Mmmm!”

The rest of the day is spent in delightful gluttony with your body intertwined with Drew’s.

“Fwaaah! Aaaaaaaaahh! Uhhhh!” //The only thing that would make this Christmas even better would be if it was a white one...//

“Taylor! I’m going to--”

You put your hand over Drew’s mouth to shush him. You grind your hips against him, faster harder, smashing your shuddering pussy down on Drew’s convulsing cock.

You both reach your limits at exactly the same time.

“I’ll give… You… Your present, Taylor!”

“Yes! Give it to meeeeeeeeeee! Aieaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you cry as Drew ejaculates into the deepest recesses of your womb.

Your screams of passion probably scare away anyone within a block.

“Damn… creampied on Christmas,” you remark as you inspect the overflow from your pussy. “What a day…”

“Yeah…” Drew agrees happily, a dopey grin plastered across his sweaty face. “What a day… Thanks, Taylor… The time I get to spend with you is the best of my life, the greatest gift I’ve ever been given. Ahh… I love you...” 

The only bad part of the day comes when you check your phone, seeing numerous missed calls from your parents, &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Marg&quot; &quot;Marg desc&quot;&gt;&gt;.

“Uh oh… What the heck am I supposed to say to them?”

Just- //stop it!//” you cry. 

//Shhhhwwoooooooo!// The air in the room changes as soon as you give in. It cools off rapidly, allowing you a gulp of clean, refreshing oxygen.

“Haaauhhh! Huh… Huh...” 

One second you were choking, the next you can breathe easily, as if Victoria had released the grip she had around your neck.

“See? Doesn’t that feel better?” Victoria asks you, all smiles.

“Yes…”

“Now come here. I want to show you the carrot instead of the stick. Both are a lot of fun in their own ways though, depending on your perspective.”

You freeze solid when you meet Vic’s icy eyes.

“Coooome on,” she coaxes you forward like a stubborn puppy.

You trudge forward with feet that feel like they are equipped with concrete shoes.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victaycomehere.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
As soon as you are within range, Victoria grabs you and pulls your lips to her own.

You’re so surprised at the intimate act that you quickly fall victim to the lioness’ tactics.

“Mwah, mmaah, mwah, mmm!”

With each reunion of your lips, you feel Victoria rubbing off on you, leaving behind tingling cherry lip gloss with every passionate stroke.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victaykissingpassion.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You’ve never been kissed like this before.

The whole thing is like a weird dream.  //What about Sam…? No! I am doing this FOR Sam!  It isn’t a betrayal… It’s just what I have to do… Plus Victoria is a guy… A really, soft, kissable guy with the cutest… FUCK! I need to snap out of it! This isn’t helping!//

Victoria is too good of a kisser. She teases and leads you at just the right moments, gradually coaxing you into a hot mess.

[[The young-appearing woman leans back and beckons you forward. The mere twitch of her finger is an unshakeable command.]]

The mere twitch of her finger is an unshakeable command." tags="" position="8919,18844" size="100,100">Your eyes are drawn to Victoria’s body like iron filings to a magnet. Although you manage to turn your head slightly, you can’t //quite// manage to look away.

“You like what you see, don’t you?” the blonde beauty taunts you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victayint.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You can’t lie. “Y-yes… You’re so hot!”

“I bet you always wished you could touch a woman like me, right?”

//A woman like you? Or me…? We aren’t women… Or are we… ?// “N-no… Ah, I mean yes…”

“Ahh, you’re such a cute little bitch, Taylor!” Victoria says as she gives your nipple a playful squeeze. So draws you in closer to pepper you with more enchanted kisses.

“Ahh!”

“Hmmph. Alright, I’ll make you feel good first but then you are returning the favor //tenfold,// got it?”

[[Without waiting for a response, Victoria pounces on you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2593" name="Without waiting for a response, Victoria pounces on you." tags="" position="8919,18994" size="100,100">Her fingers pierce you effortlessly. //Schlooook! Schliiip! Schlllooock.//

“Oooooh! You’re already fired up down here I see, Taylor,” Vic teases you.

Her soft fingers and peerless skills soon have you quivering in her slender arms.

“Mmmmm!!! Nooo… Uhnnnn…” you mewl as you cum for the fourth time. //How is she so strong?!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/vicfinger.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You never imagined a woman’s hands could feel so good.

“Ahhh… Don’t you ever get tired?” you pant.

“I’m a //witch,// I just cast a spell of endurance,” Victoria jokes.

“Shit, Lucas told you about that did he…”

“Yeeep! Now it’s your turn. Make me cum, slut,” Victoria cries out as she grinds the sweet flesh of her pussy against your face. [[“And do a good job of it or I’ll have you licking toilet seats for a week.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2594" name="“And do a good job of it or I’ll have you licking toilet seats for a week.”" tags="" position="8919,19144" size="100,100">The warm, slick flesh of Vic’s mons covers your face. It presses so hard against you that it almost bends your nose, yet still she forces herself onto you.

Your tongue vainly attempts to push Vic back but of course it does nothing except push your tongue deeper into her fragrant pussy.  The young woman’s scent is even more overpowering up close. Oddly, Victoria tastes amazing… far better than you imagine someone’s genitals ever should.

//This sweet taste… It’s like… fruit juice? No… wait… coffee?// The more you think about it, the more the flavor seems to change to suit your own desires. “Mmm! Mgphaahh!” //Damnit, I have to keep it together. I have to make Victoria cum!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victaymakemecum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You eat Victoria’s pussy like it is going out of style.

Wet slurping sounds echo through the room as you chase the growing compulsion within you.

//[[I need to get her off! Hurry! Hurry!]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2595" name="I need to get her off! Hurry! Hurry!" tags="" position="8919,19294" size="100,100">Your tongue work becomes more urgent. Finally, Victoria begins to squirm and twist her hips. The amount of secretions flooding your mouth increases. The freakishly strong woman tightens the grip on the back of your head as she rides your face, using her love juice and your saliva as lube to quicken her pace.

“MMmmmgfaaaaaaaahhhh! HRRRRRRRRRRNNNnnnnnn!

All you can do is stick out your tongue and motorboat her while hoping you don’t suffocate or get crushed by the woman’s shockingly muscled thighs.

“MMMMmmmmMMMmmm~! More, Taylor! More! Make me cuuuum!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victaymakemecum.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
You work your tongue and sore jaw into Victoria’s hot cunny until she grabs the back of your head and rides your face to completion.

She works herself into a frenzy face humping you, before finally flooding your mouth and covering your face with salty, sweet secretions that make your senses buzz.

“Guuuahhh!” you gasp as Victoria drops you like a hot rock. Your neck is cramped and sore but the only thing you want is to inhale more of Victoria’’s sickly sweet scent.

“That was pretty good,” your trainer admits. “Now go to sleep, for morning comes quickly when you’re tired. I can’t have you falling over when we have a full training regime for you to complete!”

//[[Training regime?]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2596" name="Training regime?" tags="" position="8919,19444" size="100,100">“Now, more training! It’s time to learn how to carry yourself properly.”

“Yes, Victoria…” you answer meekly, eager to get the ordeal behind you.

Your trainer’s commands come in a blur. Although you hate yourself for it, you do your best to please her. For a few hours, it feels like a sick game of Simon Says.

“Shake your booty more! Put your hips into it!” Victoria critiques your every move. “Smile. Be more graceful! No! No! That’s all wrong! You’re trying to seduce men, not make them think you have cerebral palsy!”

“Grrrr…”

“That’s better. Show off and accentuate your assets… Nice! Shake-shake-shake! Hahaha!” Vic cackles as she watches you dance.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/victoriatraining.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“You’ll be a regular //manslayer// in no time, Taylor,” she compliments you after two hours of awkward cardio and dancing work.

“If I do what you ask and work for you guys… Will you let Sam go?”

“Of course!” the Special Director answers a bit too quickly.  “But you have to finish your training first!”

“Promise me.”

“I promise! Now focus on your training!”





Will Taylor’s strategy of buying time pay off? Or is he slipping into dangerous territory?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2597" name="“I guess we don’t really have a choice…”" tags="" position="14357,8074" size="100,100">Damien raises an eyebrow. “What’s this //we// stuff? I am not getting anything out of this arrangement if you aren’t going to put out.”

“We are in this together! You saw what happened at the hospital. Plus it’s your damn fault I’m like this! So you’re going to make up for it. //Or else,//” you threaten Damien.

“Tcchh…”

Eager to get back on track, you manage to convince Damien to take you to his contact. You are not impressed by the ramshackle setup you find, crammed into a storage room in a discount motel.

The proprietor of this shady business is every bit as sketchy as his surroundings.

“Holy shit! This guy looks crazy as fuck!” you whisper (probably too loudly) to Damien.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/drtrustworthy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Oh he definitely is,” Damien whispers back. “But his pangolin scales and tiger testicles are top notch… ah, I mean //supposedly!// He definitely has access to some very rare goods! Not all of them are legal though. Trustworthy can source almost anything if the price is right. Just be a good little girl and let me do the talking,” Damien instructs.

You fall into brooding silence. //Fucking asshole...//

The “doctor” grins as you approach. “Ahh, Damien! I see you brought your cute little radioactive friend!”

“Yeah, she’s gone nuts. She wants to give up that awesome body for some stupid reason.”

“For obvious reasons!” you chime in to correct Damien.

“Anyway, my friend here had an accident…”

Trustworthy listens to an abridged version of your story. Shockingly, he shows no sign of doubt or disbelief. [[&quot;I can reverse the transformation and return you to your original form,&quot;]] Dr. Trustworthy casually asserts after listening to your tale.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2598" name="“No way, that sounds way too shady!”" tags="" position="14474,8074" size="100,100">
“Way to complain and not be part of the solution!” Damien chides you.

&quot;Super-duper-//mega//-yes!&quot; The &quot;doctor&quot; gives you the most insufferably fake smile you&#39;ve ever seen.

&quot;How much is this going to cost?&quot; you wonder.

&quot;It&#39;s free,&quot; the Doctor answers. You can see his eyes sparkling behind his glasses.

The doc as well as the whole conversation is just too suspicious for you to remain silent despite Damien subtly motioning and whispering for you to let him take the lead. &quot;Free? Like hell it is!&quot; you scoff.

&quot;I am serious! I would //never// lie! I am Dr. Trustworthy after all. It&#39;s in my name!&quot; he insists.

Your patience reserves become exhausted. You cross your arms over your tiny breasts in a vain  attempt to look menacing. &quot;//And?// What&#39;s the fuckin&#39; catch?&quot;

&quot;Ahh, you wound me! But… perhaps there is something you could help me with, now that you mention it.&quot;

&quot;I knew it!&quot; //Nothing in this world is free!//

The doctor strolls to a nearby cabinet and produces a map from one of its creaky drawers. He hands it to you after scrawling the words: “Barrel number #373 one gallon minimum. Use a type two plastic container,” next to a circled location.

“Umm…” Your eyes go wide as you examine the map. It is for an absolute fortress of an industrial plant. There are so many thousands of pipes and corridors that even looking at the blueprint makes you somewhat dizzy. “I am not breaking into a nuclear fucking power plant or something for you!”

“Not to worry! This industrial site is //abandoned.// Everything we take is merely cleaning up the Earth a little bit. You’re just going to help with a little house keeping,” argues Trustworthy.

[[“Then why don’t you get it yourself if it’s so easy?”]] you wonder.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2600" name="“Then why don’t you get it yourself if it’s so easy?”" tags="" position="14357,8374" size="100,100">Dr. Trustworthy balks. “That place is filthy! Look at this pristine lab coat! I am not going into a place like that without a hazmat suit. Besides, why go into dark, scary places myself when I have lovely worker bees like you to go retrieve what I want?” he muses.

//Damn… I don’t really trust this guy but… Unreliable companions are nothing new. // 

You can’t help but glance at Damien, who has sunken into sullen silence.  

“Alright. But how do I know you can actually change me back?” //I doubt this weirdo just so happens to have a magic cure in his pocket!//

“Hmph. I’ve dealt with similar cases before. If I had to guess, it’s a problem with your Transfigure software and not the hardware itself.”

//Transfigure!?// Your hopes soar despite your efforts to keep yourself composed.

“Okay…” //At the very least this guy seems to know something that I don’t.//

Damien finally perks up. “I never told you about Transfigure.”

Trustworthy flashes a toothy grin. “Of course it’s all linked! I’ve been following this little saga since the scene at the hospital. If you want to know what I know - then one gallon of barrel #373 is your admission price to enlightenment!”

“You swear you will cure me if I do this?”

[[“On my honor as a trustworthy physician!”]] the lab coat clad man pledges.

//This will be the last time you ever touch me, creep! I am going to get out of here! I have to… Someone will find me eventually… I just have to hold on!//

“Ohhh… Maggie… I am getting close… Huuaahh!” Terrance grabs hold of your slender hips and repeatedly slams your lightweight body down on his stiff cock.

“Uhhh! Mmmph.” Your hands clench into fists as you struggle to endure the dual internal interplay that amounts to the sullying of both your body and mind. //This will all be over soon… I hope. Oh man, what if I get stuck here forever?//

//Fwap-wap-wap-wap-whhap!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lcaptivity.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnn… Mnnn…” //I’m being violated… Wahhh! Keep it together!//

The penis begins to move faster and faster, plunging as deep into your cute little love pot as possible.

“Here I go Maggie! I am going to fill up your tight little pussy! Take it all! Get preg~NANT! UHHHHH!!! OHHhhhh yesss… Milk me baby… huah, huah, you need all that good stuff inside you.”

//Not again...// you fret as hot semen leaks out of you.

After three days pass by in much the same manner, you begin to doubt the kid made it through. [[The last embers of hope start to burn out but you stubbornly refuse to let the old man beat you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2602" name="The last embers of hope start to burn out but you stubbornly refuse to let the old man beat you." tags="" position="15181,12580" size="100,100">As you rub your sore, puckered, little pussy you know it is only a matter of time before you go completely nuts. 

“Oww… This fuckin’ cursed body…! This life... //my// life. Why does everything have to suck so much?”

//Fuuuuuuuck… I cannot stay here for much longer! I am going to lose my mind! Damien, where are you!?//

You cry yourself to sleep like a powerless child. “Damien… Someone… //help…//” you whimper into the pillow.

A few short hours later, you are jostled awake by Terrance. “Maggie, Maggie! I have needs,” he says as he paws at you.

//Not again...//

You give Bob a pleading look but his grin only expands until it eclipses half of his face. With rough hands, he guides your butt to the edge of the bed.

You tense up as your genitals line up. A slimy penis presses against your petals. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bobins.gif&quot; class=&quot;scenter&quot;&gt;
Just as you are about to be penetrated, Terrance is interrupted by a loud beeping noise.

//Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!//

You are dropped like a hot rock.

“Blast it!” Bob shouts as he runs to his room. “What is happening!?”

After waiting a few seconds, you timidly follow behind and peek into Bob&#39;s room. Inside Bob is examining a control panel. Several of the lights are flashing or burnt out. Your ears strain to overhear your captor’s mumbling.

[[“No, no, no! The generator intakes are blocked…”]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2603" name="“No, no, no! The generator intakes are blocked…”" tags="" position="15181,12730" size="100,100">With a muttered curse and a loud //thwack,// Bob pulls back a switch and the entire bunker goes dark.

“W-what’s happening?” you wonder in an oddly high pitched voice.

“Don’t worry Maggie. I shut down the generator before it could become a hazard. There is a problem outside. I have to go outside and fix it but I’ll wear a suit. I know you’re scared but you will just have to wait for me here.”

Bob’s appraisal is accurate. You are terrified. It bothers you that both the prospect of him leaving and never returning scares you almost as much as if he did.

//What if I am just left alone in the dark… FOREVER!?!// you fret.

Bob gives you a sloppy kiss on the cheek. “Pray for my success, Maggie. I will be back as quickly as I can!” he says as he steps into the “off limits” section of the bunker, sealing the broad steel door behind him.

You are left alone with your worries and queasy stomach. You wait next to a flashing emergency light, the only source of comfort in sight.

After what feels like an hour later, there is still no sign of Bob.

//Did the radiation get him?// you wonder. Shaking your head angrily you answer your own question. “There is no radiation… //hopefully//… but I’m still trapped. I’m too young to die!” you fret.

Your monologue of horror is interrupted by a loud banging sound.

//Clang. Clang. CLANG.//

“B-Bob?”

//Screeeeeeeee! Rrrrrrrrrhhhhh…//

An ear piercing scraping noise fills your ears. [[Something is breaking into the bunker!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2604" name="Something is breaking into the bunker!" tags="" position="15211,12880" size="100,100">The sounds continue as if a battle is being fought in the airlock chamber.

After thirty seconds of vicious banging, the bunker becomes silent.

“Bob?” you venture. There is no reply.

In the center of the door is a small viewing port. It takes all of your courage to move towards it. You are forced to your tippy toes to peek through.

Against a backdrop of hazy equipment and radiation suits, a familiar slender figure appears through the glass. Your hopes soar.

//No fucking way!//

The hatch opens slowly with a rush of fresh air. It is the scent of //freedom.//

&quot;YAAAAY!&quot; you squeal happily. &quot;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Damien&quot; &quot;Damien desc&quot;&gt;&gt;! Daaaaamieeeeeen!!! You came! You really found me!&quot;

&quot;Of course! I haven&#39;t stopped searching for you since the moment you disappeared. You&#39;re my cute little girl and I’d rather die than share you! I never should have let you out of my sight!&quot;

You have never been happier to see Damien&#39;s stupid face.

//I can’t believe it! He actually came for me!// Even if Damien’s motives are impure, you are still incredibly grateful. Damien&#39;s actions are shockingly //heroic//, an off-putting and endearing fact.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/rescue.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Pulse quickening, you throw yourself into his arms. &quot;Damien! //You fucking saved me!// Thaaaank you!&quot; you cry as tears gush from your eyes. 

Damien’s smile fills your heart with joy. &quot;Of course I did. I never stopped looking for you. You&#39;re //precious// to me,&quot; he explains to you. His big hands caress your hair. &quot;And not just for sex.// I want to keep you forever.// [[I couldn&#39;t bear to lose you.]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2605" name="I couldn&#39;t bear to lose you." tags="" position="15211,13030" size="100,100">Damien hugs you tightly. He loudly smells your hair, turning the strange action into a kiss on the top of your head. Oddy, you return the embrace, grateful for the friendly contact of another human being.

After you regain a small bit of your composure, you pull yourself away from Damien’s hard but comforting cheest.

&quot;That&#39;s… uh, sweet, I guess… So you don&#39;t care about sex anymore?&quot; you wonder skeptically.

Damien is quick to correct you. &quot;That&#39;s not what I said! I can&#39;t wait to take you home and give you everything I have been saving up since you disappeared!!&quot;

&quot;Oh…&quot; //Out of one sex bunker and into another...// Still, you find it impossible not to be elated when you look at Damien. Your heart flutters in your chest.

//Damnit, all this time in the bunker has messed with my head!// 

“What should we do with him?” Damien wonders, pointing his chin towards where Bob Terrance has fallen at the bottom of the bunker’s angled staircase. The old man looks like he is in poor shape. 

It is hard for you to feel much empathy for him. “Did you hurt him?”

“Not more than necessary. He’s lucky I didn’t kill him. Anyone that hurts a child should be castrated.&quot;

“I’m not a child…” Damien’s attitude irks you, since your immature appearing state has only inspired him to become an even bigger creep. &quot;Speak for yourself...&quot;

//I still haven’t forgotten what Damien did to me!// Your anger is immediately redirected to the source of your latest predicament.

“Fucking Terrance…”

//I was almost starting to believe his end of the world bullshit!//

A part of you wants to beat his comatose body but you realize that would make you more like him than you&#39;d prefer.

[[“Let’s seal him back in the bunker!”]]

You help Damien drag the old man back inside the main chamber. 

With a wrench in hand, you smash every monitor and piece of glass in the bunker.

After Bob’s computer equipment is reduced to a pile of scattered debris, you exit the bunker for what you hope is the final time.

You chain the outer door closed and spend the next few hours shovelling dirt over the bunker’s hatch.

“Yeah, there is no way he is getting that open from the inside,” Damien appraises. “That’s what that prick gets for trying to steal you away from me!”

You sigh at Damien’s idiocy. 

[[“Now what about you and me, Taylor?”]] Damien wonders.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2607" name="“Let’s call the cops!”" tags="" position="15211,13180" size="100,100">Damien seems surprised. “You want to turn him in?”

You nod. “He deserves justice.”

“He might just skip bail or get off on a technicality. Plus this idea requires you to break your cover. I don’t think going to the cops is a good idea.”

“Good point...”

“Otherwise, what? He will probably be on the street in no time!” Damien predicts.

“Not necessarily…” You snatch Bob’s key’s from Damien’s hand and run to Bob’s room.

You open a storage locker, actually a hidden closet, revealing a veritable armory. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/armory.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I knew it! These prepper guys love guns just as much as cans of Spam,” you glote.

“Whoa…” Damien’s eyes go wide. “There is even a machine gun over here! This isn’t legal! I think with a little “anonymous” tip to Homeland Bob Terrance’s days of terror are over.”

“I overheard him saying he wants to assassinate the president.”

“Is that true?”

“No.”

“Well it is now.” Damien snaps a picture of the armory with his phone.

You leave Bob tied up lying on his bed. You are confident with all the incriminating items in the bunker your former captor will soon be behind bars. A fitting reversal of fate for such a dickhead.

“I’ll send the tip by email and we can call a second on a payphone on our way home.”

“Home…?” You feel genuinely homesick for your real home but going with Damien is still an improvement. 

[[“Now what about you and me, Taylor?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2608" name="“I think we should take him with us. He could be our guinea pig!”" tags="" position="15361,13180" size="100,100">“That’s not a bad idea… we could always use a test subject.”

“Better him than me!” you agree.

“Oh. Maybe we should leave him behind. It is a lot of fun to experiment on you.”

“Tch.”

“Well, after what he did to you, I guess it is okay if we abduct him, right?”

“That’s just reacting in kind. Fighting fire with fire,” you agree.

“Okay, we will take this putz with us. I say we try the yellow potion on him.”

“Without my condition won’t he just die?”

Damien shrugs. “A valiant death in the name of science. Better than he deserves. Plus if it works… I might get two lolis!”

You sigh. “There is something seriously wrong with you.”

Damien drags Terrance to the hatch. You try and help but your stick-like arms contribute little to the task.

Once Terrance is safely gagged, bound, and rolled in a sleeping bag in the backseat of Damien’s truck, your would-be savior turns to you with a wicked gleam in his eyes.

[[“Now what about you and me, Taylor?”]] Damien wonders.
&lt;&lt;set $bobprisoner to true&gt;&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2609" name="“Now what about you and me, Taylor?”" tags="" position="15211,13330" size="100,100">You gulp nervously.

“J-just focus on the road!” you insist.

Damien continues driving but is plain that most of his attention is directed at you. “I never should have left you, Taylor. Or let you leave… It’s the same thing really. I should have protected you. I’m sorry.”

“It’s alright… It’s not really your fault. Well, I mean it is, but not that last part… And you came through when it mattered most. You got me out of that prison!”

Damien looks at you like a starving man would a pizza. //Or a horny perv looking at a cute girl...// You are the undeniable focus of his attention. The slender man’s gaze is as palpable as a physical touch.

Your cheeks become hot. “E-eyes on the road!” you insist. 

The ride fades into silence as you both begin to imagine what might come next.

Your debt to Damien has clearly increased even further. Your hopes of paying it off with conventional means are slim. //And there is only one thing I have that Damien wants...// You sigh.

&lt;&lt;if $bobprisoner is true&gt;&gt;You have fun dragging Bob down the stairs. His comatose body is soon locked in a basement closet. After giving him a firm kick in the junk, you leave him behind without a second thought.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;Once upstairs, you get about five minutes to get settled before Damien is pawing at you like a hound in heat.

“Are you going to show me some appreciation?” Damien asks.

“I suppose you have earned a reward,” you allow. [[Although you are a fraction of Damien’s size and strength, Damien lets you take control.]]

Your fingers brush against the petals, making it impossible to deny their wetness. “Ahhh, daddy… Please do whatever you want.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienreward.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien’s eyes go wide. “Yes! I’ve been dreaming of this every single night since you’ve been gone!”

The big pervert needs no further urging. He is on you in flash.

“Let’s get to the bed,” Damien says before he sweeps you up and carries you away like a weightless doll.

Damien sets you almost reverently down on his bed. In typical Damien fashion, his admirable qualities are balanced by his crass ones. [[“I want to fuck your mouth!”]] he announces with his next breath.

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbigcockreveal.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Did you miss this guy?” Damien teases you.

“Hmph. Not really…”

“So you preferred that old guy?” Damien speculates.

“Clearly not…”

The reality of your situation nearly clubs you in the face.

“Whoa…” You jealously bite the inside of your cheek as you stare at Damien’s manhood.

Damien is clearly aroused. Even with two hands wrapped around his pole there is still shaft to spare.

Within two seconds of you touching him, Damien is harder than diamond.

“Hnnng! I love when you touch me!” he cries out.

You suppress a sigh and resign yourself to your work. [[“I guess there is no point in wasting time…”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2613" name="“I guess there is no point in wasting time…”" tags="" position="15101,13630" size="100,100">Cock in tiny hand, you begin to pleasure Damien.

“W-wow… I’m still kind of amazed and grossed out by this thing…”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbigcockfeel.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Ahhhh! I am a man… willingly touching another man&#39;s thing… Why does this keep happening to me!?//

&quot;Ahh, your hands are so warm and silky smooth… AhhhAHHhhh~!.... Keep going! It feels so good! You really know how to handle a cock, Taylor!&quot; Damien compliments you. &quot;Big Daddy Damien approves!&quot;

//Damnit…// You have logged a lot of hours pleasuring yourself, you just never expected to put the experience to use in this manner- and especially not for Damien&#39;s benefit.

You grip the penis and give it a few jerks, marvelling at its size relative to your dainty fingers.

“Taylor, you are overdressed,” Damien chides you.

“I guess that is true,” you agree with a sly smile. Your old friend watches with delight as your clothes fall by the wayside.

Squatting on the floor, you let Damien loom over you like a giant. //He’s so big... // you passively admire him.

“Unnmm….” You can’t help but recognize Damien’s //bigness// carries over to other areas.

Your body, now conditioned and accustomed to frequent sex, begins to yearn for release perhaps as much as Damien’s does. [[You eye your friend’s straining bulge and fail to fight off the butterflies set loose in your stomach.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2614" name="“I want to fuck your mouth!”" tags="" position="15211,13628" size="100,100">You roll your eyes in disgust. “Fine. Whatever.”

“Open up and say, “aw,”” Damien quips. You are manhandled into position and receive an uncomfortable close-up view of your friend’s junk.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienhomecoming.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Fucking ass-mmmmmgggfaaahhh!” Your curse is interrupted by the cock’s advance. It moves like a battering ram, plowing down the center of your throat.

“Ggaafaaahh! MMmmmMMMPHHG!!”

It becomes hard to breathe. You see spots in your vision. Perhaps it is the oxygen deprivation, but your light headed state makes detachment easier.

When Damien begins to fondle you, driving his seasoned fingers into your love-crevice, you regret offering yourself as a reward. //This is bad… Really, really bad!//

“Gg… Mmmgg…” //Damnit, he is treating me like his toy...// Worst of all, is the fact you knew this was coming.

//It’s still better than the bunker!// you assure yourself.

“Awe, it’s so cute and all wet…” Damien observes, much to your embarrassment. You cover your eyes so you don’t have to look at him. “I need to fuck you, Taylor. But you need it too, right?”

You offer a non-committal moan in response.

[[“Perfect. Let’s let our bodies do the talking!”]] Damien misunderstands you.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2615" name="“Perfect. Let’s let our bodies do the talking!”" tags="" position="15211,13778" size="100,100">Without any foreplay on your end, Damien bends you over and mounts you from behind. A second later, he rams his cock into your defenceless vagina. The entire length penetrates into your deepest recess and stretches your tiny pussy beyond its maximum capacity.

//Schlllooop.// “Hnnnnnghhhh…. HNN!” You grit your teeth, silently amazed that such a tiny body is capable of such a feat.

//I guess I already had too much sex...//

The next thing you know, you are hurled forward and it takes everything you can just to withstand Damien’s abuse.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienhomecoming2.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Fwap-wap-wap-fap-fap-fap!//

You want to cry out for Damien to stop but you know he won’t until he is finished. Instead, your words emerge as quasi moans, driving your partner into an even greater frenzy.

“Uh…! Uh-uh-uh-UH!-UH! Ohhhhhh! OHHH! UHHNNNN…! Dah-dah-Damien! Please go slower!”

“I caaaaaaaaaaaaann’t!”

//FAP-FAP-FAP-FAP!//

He grabs your arms as he plows your furrough, pulling you back to add even greater impetus and impact to his thrusts.

“Nnn… This…sex... is…” //Totally different than with Bob...// Technically you are being raped right now but those lines have long ago been blurred. Right now you are just a nubile little nymph, [[slave to the confusing warm sensations that have now permeated into every fiber of your being.]]

You squirm, struggling to repeatedly take in Damien’s girth.

“Oohhhhh yeah! It feels good, right?” he presses.

Unable to lie in this oddly intimate moment, you nod. It appears that somewhere within your transformation addled psyche you have become accustomed to rough play.

//I like it this way…?// 

“I… Huahhh… I want it…?”

“Yes, Taylor, you fucking love it! You love my cock!”

//No, that can’t possibly be right! I’m not really a horny little girl! Even if I&#39;m forced to play the part for a few nights...// 

“Suck on this, baby.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lrailedthumbsuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien jams his thumb into your mouth. 

“Mmmphhahh!”

He is clearly getting off by playing with two of your orifices at the same time. Just when your heady, lust driven madness seems near its apex, Damien jams his thumb up your ass.

He then proceeds to fuck all your holes at once. To your surprise, the act makes you orgasm hard.

[[You flop around, convulsing on Damien’s hot cock while waves of pleasure undulate through your body.]]

&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damienhomecoming3.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Half delirious, you stick out your tongue. 

“Fwaahh… I am Damien’s reward…”

“Yes, baby, you are the greatest gift of my life,” Damien asserts as he stares at you. His spent, flaccid cock rises back to life right before your eyes.

Damien’s penile resurrection shocks and impresses you. 

“Just how much stamina do you have?” you wonder.

Damien gives you a cocky smile. “Lots. I’ve been pent up without you. Let’s get back to it. We have a lot of time to make up.”

Damien continues in his apparent quest to fuck you death.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ltaylorpounded.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Hnnnn! Oh-my-fuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkk! I’m going to break… Faaahhh...” //He is definitely using that green potion...//

//Fwap-fap-splot-fap-fap-fap!// Damien’s unflagging staff stirs you into a sexual frenzy.

“Hnn! HNNN! I Caaan’t t~taake it anymore! I’m gunna cuuuum!” you wail while clamping down on Damien’s dick.

“Me too! Take it all!”

Damien grunts as you feel hot cum fill your pussy.

Sweaty but not exhausted, Damien whispers to you. [[“One more before bed.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2618" name="“One more before bed.”" tags="" position="15211,14228" size="100,100">You lie on your back and open your legs.

Damien kneels in front of you. Your sticky genitals are rubbed together and then, with a delightful penetrative push, you feel full again.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/ltaylorfucked.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Jaw clenched, you brace yourself for another round of rough sex.

Damien obliges your expectations. After a vicious bout of fucking, he blows his load all over your stomach and passes out beside you within seconds.

//Wow...//

With Damien’s essence pooling in your belly button, you finally relax, content that your mission is complete.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lcumtumpov.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The odor of semen fills your senses. The whole room reeks like sex. You desire a shower but are too tired to move.

“Mmm… Oh… Wow, you shot out so much of this stuff…” //It stinks but… there is something about this smell...// “Mmm… At least I’m safe now…”

[[You fall asleep hoping that your debt to Damien is paid.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2619" name="You fall asleep hoping that your debt to Damien is paid." tags="" position="15211,14378" size="100,100">The morning brings new clarity… and fresh obligations.

“Wait. Say that again, Damien.”

“You heard me the first time. I want you to try on some sexy clothes for me! Let’s do the lingerie first!”

“You want me to wear //lingerie!?//” you repeat Damien’s insane request. The mere idea that Damien would make such a perverted demand enrages you. “Duuude! I am not your little fucking dress up doll!”

“You kind of are though,” Damien replies. He starts rubbing your legs with his large hands.

“Eeek! Damien, why can’t you just leave me alone? Ahhh!”

“How many times do I have to explain myself to you? You are a walking fantasy and I am not letting you out of my sight!”

You shake your head. Damien’s warped logic still manages to confound you. “And you think that is reasonable? Seriously?”

“Fuck reason! You’re super cute now! Why would you want to go back to being an ugly dude?”

[[“What do you mean!? I wasn’t ugly!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2620" name="“What do you mean!? I wasn’t ugly!”" tags="" position="15211,14528" size="100,100">“Yeah, you were a real //alpha male,//” Damien replies, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Frankly, you are way better off the way you are now. You’re fucking //PERFECT!// Dontcha know that there is no improving on perfection? You should obviously just stay like this. I promise I will protect you and treat you right. I will keep you forever and our lives will be filled with bliss,” Damien imagines, sounding more delusional by the utterance.

Words suddenly feel hard to come by. //“Filled with bliss?”// //He’s gone completely nuts!//

“Well, //I’ll// be filled with bliss; you’ll be filled with my cock. But you will come to love it eventually I am sure. Then, bam, mutual happiness.”

Damien seems to have attended the same classes as Evan on how to reason like a moron. It is hard for you to do anything except sigh in exasperation.

“How about I take you out for some fresh air later? A walk maybe?” Damien suggests.

“I am not a dog!” you bristle.

Damien grins, while no doubt imagining something pervy. “Oh my little darling, Taylor…”

“Don’t call me that!” you snap.

Damien sighs. “I didn’t want to bring this up, but these experiments are getting really expensive. I have been putting in a lot of overtime and I let you live here rent free. I am funding all of this shit… I think it is totally unfair that you won&#39;t try on some cute panties for me.”

You choose your words carefully. “I appreciate you helping me but I can’t keep trading you creepy favors like this…”

“Why not?”

“You know why!”

&quot;I thought we were attracted to each other.&quot;

“No, it&#39;s because you keep pushing me! We have already had //sex//! Look at me! We need to focus on the getting my life back.”

“Mmmm! Okay. After you try on the lingerie!”

[[“Fucking fine!”]]
[[Firmly refuse Damien’s demands.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2621" name="“Fucking fine!”" tags="" position="15136,14678" size="100,100">“I can’t believe I am indulging Damien in his creepy fantasies…”

You open up the bag and find a sexy black bra and a pair of panties made of see through mesh. Beside it is a second set of frilly white lace underwear with stockings.

The thought of wearing either makes you want to die from embarrassment. //And then I will have to show that ogre… Yuck!//

//How the hell do I put on all these things?// You look at the garter belt and stockings with confusion.

“Come out!” Damien calls from behind the doorway. “Daddy wants to see!”

“Damnit, just a second…” //My life is tale of embarrassment… and here I go writing more fuckin’ chapters...//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lling2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien, a grown man, swoons. “Holy-FUCK! You look sooo cute //and fuckable!//” he adds.

Your smirk disappears as Damien’s lust intensifies. “Ummm… I knew this was a bad idea!”

Damien breaks within seconds. “I want to just rip those off you,” he growls. “But first….”

//Chickshaw!//

Damien snaps a picture of you.

“What the hell, Damien!?”

“What? These are just for me… and it’s not like anyone would recognize you anyway, right?”

“That’s not the point.”

[[“Now put on the sexy clothes and then take off the sexy clothes,”]] Damien suggests.

Compared to the first set, the black lingerie is easy to put on.

When you return and stand before Damien his jaw drops to the ground.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lling.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Chickshaw! Chckkk!//

“Hnnnnnfgghhh!”

Within seconds Damien begins to rub his groin.

“STOP!” you shriek. //I’ve got to stop this disaster in motion!//

“I’m sorry!” Damien&#39;s apology surprises you.

//Even though I am tiny I have all the power here!//

The realization emboldens you.

“Hehe…”

Maybe now was a good time to indulge in any lingering perversions you may harbor… //What am I thinking!?//

In this position you can do nothing but accept his huge cock inside you as gravity assists your penetration. The perverted asshole slams his manhood into you with such force you fear you will be split in half.

“Oh yeah, baby! Ride Daddy’s cock!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lfloatingfuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“AHHHH!  Unnnggh! Uhhah….” You are consumed with the sense of having Damien’s huge weiner deep inside your petite body. It moves with such speed you are certain your rapey friend intends to thoroughly rearrange your insides.

//Fwap-fap-fap-fap--FAP--FAP--FAP!//

Juices are running down your legs. You hope they didn’t emerge from you. “Hnn…”

//Damnit…!// Wishing you could shut off your mind, Damien pounds you into oblivion. You give way to your body’s all consuming urges.

“I should take this chance and do some research,” you decide.

You find an interesting book on genetics sitting on Damien’s shelf. Although most of it goes over your head, you find some of the information to be fascinating.

“Hmmm… But can any of it help me? I need someone with more scientific knowledge…”

As you turn the pages, you hear &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Damien&quot; &quot;Damien desc&quot;&gt;&gt; creep up behind you and flip up your skirt.

“Like me? I am a doctor, you know.”

“I am trying to read, //doctor Damien//!” you sarcastically protest. //Damien is definitely trying to distract me… and the worst part is that there is a small part of me that wants to let him...// You fear that if you keep having sex with Damien you won’t want to reclaim your old life. //This body is definitely messing with my mind!//

With a hopeful smile, he hands you a shirt that would definitely be humiliating to wear.

“What the hell, man? I’m not wearing this shit!”

Damien delivers a stern ultimatum. “Wear the shirt or wear a bra.”

[[So it’s one pervy choice or the other? I’ll take the bra! At least I will be covered from your prying eyes!”]]

You want to resist your feminization but that pales before the immense perversions of your friend.

“Where does he even get all these clothes anyway?”

You feel foolish as you try  on another bra. It practically falls off your chest.  //This thing is pointless!//

Your relationship gradually develops into something permanent and twisted.

In the days following your rescue, you find that rewarding Damien comes naturally. He never brings up your rescue, rather letting the debt sit in the room like an invisible elephant. You can’t see it but it is definitely there.

You let him dress you up in outrageous costumes. You indulge Damien repeatedly and, after a time, you note that your disgust has faded. Your protests become less frequent and, most oddly enough, you begin to have fun.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lshowoff.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

At night you dream of sex, during the day you have it in spades. “Mm! Mm! Mmm! Faaah… Why am I looking forward to this?”

“Because it feels awesome!” Damien answers your question.

“Just be quiet and fuck me,” you request.

You enjoy some morning “exercise” with Damien.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lmorningexercise.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Although you spend most of the time on your back with Damien doing most of the work, you still enjoy a rush along with frequent toe-curling orgasms. By the time you are finished, you are breathing heavily, covered in sweat and cum.

Your days continue on in this fashion [[until one day Damien comes to you with a strange request.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2632" name="until one day Damien comes to you with a strange request." tags="" position="15137,15880" size="100,100">“Taylor, can you do this for me?”

“You want me to get a fucking tongue ring?! Are you kidding me!?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/tstud.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I thought it would suit you.”

“You just want more blowjobs!”

“No, that’s only part of it. I think you’d look hot as fuck with one. It is like innocent and slutty side by side,” Damien rationalizes.

“You’re such a pervert.” You sigh. //A dumb pervert who saved my life twice...// 

Getting a piercing would probably hurt. It also has nothing to do with your main ambition. //Fuck, what ambition? All I do is bang Damien all day...//

“Damnit…” You toy with one of the metal tongue studs.

//Yikes, am I really going to further modify my body for Damien?//
[[Get the tongue piercing for Damien]]
[[“No way! I’m done modifying my body for your pleasure!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2633" name="Get the tongue piercing for Damien" tags="" position="15062,16030" size="100,100">“Owww….!”

The piercing stings worse than a kick to the balls.

Your commitment confirms your current purpose: to be used as an object for Damien’s pleasure. //He already treats me like a sex-doll. Now I’m a sexy doll with a tongue ring...//

Urged on by your sudden streak of submissiveness, Damien fucks you like a madman for the next two weeks. Your tight little pussy becomes less so with each pass of Damien’s mammoth cock.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/damienfleshed.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

But when your tongue finally heals, you put it to good use.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lpiercingbj.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“You look like such a slutty little girl with a pierced tongue and my dick in your hand.”

“Mm… Mhmm… Mggfaahh…”

“Yeaaah… hot tongue… cold, hnng… metal uhh… you’re the best cocksucker in the world, Taylor.”

Things just keep rolling downhill from there...

“Ahh shit! You’ve become my dreamslut!”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ldreamslut.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You tell Damien what he wants to hear. “Mmmm… Damien… Your cock tastes so good… I could lick this all day.”

“That’s pretty much what you do. Oh. Oh! OH! Here it comes, swallow it all, Taaaylor!”

A rush of warm, bitter semen fills your mouth but not for long. “Mhm, all gone!” you say as you present your bare tongue..




Current End of Content - Will Bad Little Taylor find a way to be good? Maybe one day...
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2634" name="“No way! I’m done modifying my body for your pleasure!”" tags="" position="15212,16030" size="100,100">Damien nods solemnly. “You’re right. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked to mar such a beautiful, perfect body. I love you //exactly the way you are now.//”

“...What?” //Love…? Ahh...// Before you can organize your thoughts, Damien sweeps you up in a big bear hug.

Damien picks you up effortlessly and carries you to bed. //I’ve been spending way too much time in Damien’s room...// you fret.

Oddly enough, instead of pushing you into sex, he merely snuggles up to you and falls asleep.

Held in damien’s big, strong arms, you follow suit.

//Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...//

After a nice nap you head downstairs and start surfing the web. You rub your face and accidently pull out a long blonde hair.

“Ouch.”

Your hair constantly gets in the way. Although you have become somewhat used to the distraction, you resolve to do something about it.

“I guess it’s normal for a pretty girl to do her hair…” A part of you cringes. //Taylor Roux the little girl.//

Damien approves of your new interest and appearance. [[It isn’t long before the horny rhino’s tusk is pointed in your direction.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2635" name="Damien ogles you with an intensity that makes you nauseous." tags="" position="15027,14980" size="100,100">“Okay, that’s enough! Let’s break for lunch!”

“After we have sex,” Damien insists.

“What? No!”

“Yes?” Damien corrects you.

“Fucking no!” you shout as you attempt to flee.

With two great strides, Damien moves forward and captures you in his arms. Even pushing back with all your might he refuses to budge. His body feels like it is made of soft iron.

“Let me goooooooo!” you wail.

You suspect that even as a man Damien was stronger than you. In your current body that disparity is now enormous.

Damien easily overpowers you, controlling your limbs with his freakishly strong hands.

He opens your legs and places you on top, pressing his hard cock against your mons.

The penis looks so large compared to its intended place of entry, that you try and squirm away but the young doctor holds you firmly in place for your //injection.//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lride.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
With one look at Damien’s expression your resistance dies. //We are going to have sex and there isn’t anything I can do about it...// You realize that you are literally fucked.

“Eeea! Ah!” you squeak as you are groped and squeezed. [[“I need to get away from Damien!”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2636" name="He begins to thrust inside you with a slow but steady pace and your body immediately responds in kind" tags="" position="15027,15280" size="100,100">
“Mm! Hmm! Hmm!”

“Well, do you want me to stop?”

You sigh, annoyed at the games Damien seems intent on playing. //Is my body or mind more honest?// you wonder. “You don’t have to stop,” you tell Damien.

“Hah! That’s my girl!” Damien gleefully pounds you so hard that the letters on the page shake to the point of making them impossible to read.

“Daaaamnit! Damien! Mmmphh…” //As if he’d stop if I asked him.// Damien is like a single minded lust monster once his pervy switch has been turned on!

Obscene wet sex sounds echo throughout the room, dying your face scarlet and driving Damien into a wild sexual mania. 

//Fap-fap-fap!//

“Hnnnnn!”

“Your pussy is irresistable, Taylor! Fucking you is all I think about! Take it! Take all of my cock and tell me you love it!”

Instead of answering you just bite your lip. You are glad that Damien can’t see your face from behind.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lstudyingwithdamien.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[You let Damien do his business, content to enjoy the ride in silence.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2637" name="It isn’t long before the horny rhino’s tusk is pointed in your direction." tags="" position="15212,16180" size="100,100">Events proceed as they usually do. You are coaxed into doing something lewd. 

//Whap-whap-whap.// Your hand milks Damien’s cock until eruption.

A huge load of cum splashes over your face.

Damien smiles down at you like a man in heaven. “That is a lovely look for you, princess.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lprincessfacial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Uhmm… Please don’t call me that!”you snap.

“Why not?”

“Because I don’t fucking like it!”

“Ahh… I love covering my little spunky princess with spunk,” Damien continues.

“Errrr…” Sucking cock has made you a sopping mess. Luckily, your host is there to help scratch your itch… repeatedly.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/damiendoggyyp.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ung! Unnn! Mnn! Hnnn! Ffuuuuuuuuuucccccccccck! Give me more!”

“As my princess commands! Hnnggh!”

//Fap-fap-fap...//

//Damnit, another day lost to sating lust...//

A few days later you are sitting with Damien in the park during one of your rare outings. The weather is good and the fresh air is rejuvenating. Everything is going fine until you notice a man in a suit giving you the evil eye.

Flashbacks from the hospital make you nervous. Yet with Damien at your side you manage to stave off a feeling of total panic.

//What the hell has gotten into me? [[I don’t remember being so much of a scaredy cat…]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2638" name="I don’t remember being so much of a scaredy cat…" tags="" position="15212,16330" size="100,100">Just as you are about to whisper to Damien that you’d like to go home, a familiar face jogs through the park.

//Oh my god! It’s &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Evan&quot; &quot;Evan desc&quot;&gt;&gt;!//

The man in the suit is forgotten as a jumbled surge of hope, guilt, and shame bubble up into your conscious mind, forming a volatile concoction.

Maybe Evan could save you.  //But do I even need saving?//

You look up at Damien and he smiles down at you with clear affection. //Or Damien’s version of it… Fuck! What do I do?// 

Evan begins to walk away...

[[Stay by Damien’s side.]]
[[Call out to Evan]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2639" name="Stay by Damien’s side." tags="" position="15137,16480" size="100,100">You can’t explain anything to Evan given your current state. The simplest and safest course is simply to stay by Damien’s side so that’s exactly what you do.

Evan runs off, oblivious to your presence. 

“Damien, I think we should…”

“We should … what?”

“Go… but look, we’re surrounded!” you warn in a harsh whisper.

Damien’s eyes go wide as he scans the park. There are three men in suits and two police officers, sticking out like sore thumbs in a sea of young students. Just when you think your heart can take no more, the pair of cops approach.

//Oh shit… those guys in the suits aren’t messing around! What are we going to do!?//

“Relax, we just bluff. They can’t know that you are a cute little blonde girl.”

“We need a cover story!” Your mind shoots into overdrive in an attempt to conjure up some kind of excuse.

“Why don’t you pretend to be my daughter?” Damien suggests.

The cops are practically within earshot.

[[“God damnit! I guess there isn’t much choice...”]]
[[“No, that&#39;s fucking stupid!”]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2640" name="Call out to Evan" tags="" position="15287,16480" size="100,100">
EoC :(

A new savior and fresh hope? Or maybe another just another transfer from one perv to another?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2641" name="“God damnit! I guess there isn’t much choice...”" tags="" position="15062,16630" size="100,100">“Excuse me sir. May I ask what you and…”

“My daughter,” Damien supplies.

“... are doing out here today?”

Damien raises an eyebrow. “We are just enjoying the park. Is there something wrong, officer?”

“I’m not sure.” The cop addresses you directly. “How are you feeling, sweetie?”

You smile brightly. “Great! //Daddy// here keeps good care of me.”

Damien shivers at your words.

The cop appraises you for a moment before nodding. “Your daughter is very cute,” he says to your “daddy,” although his stern, grey eyes linger on Damien’s youthful face. 

The cops eventually bugger off… as do the men in the suits. You half expected them to attack you. //Whew… Safe again… Err, for now...//

Damien grabs your hand and pulls you away.

“Come on honey!”

“Where are we going?”

“Where we can get some privacy.”

“For what?”

Damien corrals you into an alcove next to two park maintenance buildings.

You catch on pretty quickly to Damien’s intent. “Oh…”

[[“Now be a good little girl and suck your daddy’s dick!”]] he says as he pushes you downward with enough strength to nearly buckle your knees. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2642" name="“No, that&#39;s fucking stupid!”" tags="" position="15212,16630" size="100,100">“I guess you are a bit old to be my daughter,” Damien laughs. “Sister it is then!”

You shoot Damien a dirty look. “That’s only marginally better.”


EoC - Will the bluff succeed or backfire? Find out eventually on Transfigure - the game with too many fuckin’ paths.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2643" name="“Now be a good little girl and suck your daddy’s dick!”" tags="" position="15062,16780" size="100,100">Damien’s big smelly cock bounces free and nearly clubs you in the face.

“Shit, Damien! Relax!”

“Relax me!”

You realize the least amount of hassle is probably to shut up and satisfy Damien’s cravings. //Otherwise he will just keep pestering me… Plus I need him clear headed if the cops come back!//

You peek out from behind Damien, making sure the coast is clear before setting about your task. “Mmrrr! This fuckin’ dick just won’t stay down…”

With hand and tongue, you set about your task to make Damien feel good. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lhandjob.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Crchkk!// A twig snaps in the distance.

“Shit! Someone is coming!” Your freeze for a second. Greater urgency has been placed on your work. “They might see us…” The thought is both a bit of a turn on and a bit scary at the same time.

[[Try some dirty talk.]]
[[Keep stroking.]]x
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2644" name="Try some dirty talk." tags="" position="14987,16930" size="100,100">“Mmm I love the way your cock tastes, daddy! Please give me your looove! I want it right fuckin’ here in my mouth! Let me taste you. Give me some cummies please!” you say before sticking out your tongue.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lbigcumshot.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien cannot contain himself. He jerks off madly, shooting a rain of hot semen over your pink little tongue before ramming his spent cock in your mouth for final cleaning service.

//Sluuurp!//

“Mmmm… Yum!”

You manage to swallow and wipe away the obvious drips of cum while Damien zips up. Your efforts finish in just the nick of time as one of the police officers from earlier appears to interrupt you.

//Fuck! Did they follow us? That was close!//

“Just exploring nature, officer,” Damien says with a nod. The cop watches you pass. You smile brightly with lips still stained with Damien’s seed.

“That was hot, Taylor. Your sluttiness saved us! Any longer there and that cop would have walked in on quite a show.”

//Sex saved us…? And Damien saved me...//

[[Later at Damien’s place, you let him do whatever he wants.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2645" name="Keep stroking." tags="" position="15137,16930" size="100,100">You keep jerking Damien’s penis. Your hand pumps faster and faster but just as Damien begins to moan and precum fills your palm, your arm begins to cramp.

“Oww…” 

“Ahem!” a loud cough interrupts you. One of the police officers from earlier is standing a few feet away.

//Uh oh...//

“We are in trouble now…”


Current EoC… More crazy stories coming soon!
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2646" name="Later at Damien’s place, you let him do whatever he wants." tags="" position="14987,17080" size="100,100">The pervy young man takes full advantage of your offer.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lpronepound.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ahhhhh!” //Why do I keep letting this happen…? Why am I such a slut?//

You spend most of your waking time making each other cum.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lchokefucked.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Gentle, rough, quick, slow, it makes no matter. You love having sex as a girl. [[It isn’t long before you and Damien exhaust exploring every possible sex position.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2647" name="It isn’t long before you and Damien exhaust exploring every possible sex position." tags="" position="14987,17230" size="100,100">“How did it turn out like this?” you wonder after yet another marathon fuck session.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/ldaaily.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“It’s fate,” Damien asserts. “Everything that’s happened. Everything we’ve done. All fate.”

“Fuck fate. I hate you so much sometimes!”

“That isn’t the expression of someone who dislikes something,” Damien objects.  He then strokes your hair like a favorite pet. “I wish there was a way to make you be more honest…” he trails off.

“I am honest.”

Damien shakes his head. “Your body is honest. Your pussy is honest… but your lips? Not so much.”

“Hah. You love my lips,” you tease, making a kissy face.

“Oh yeah. I will be ready for you to put them to work here in a second.”

“Pfft.”

“I might be a bit big for you but that’s okay. You will grow into it.  In the meantime, I will train you to be the best little cocksucker ever!” [[Damien enthusiastically declares as he guides your head down onto his swollen crotch.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2648" name="Damien enthusiastically declares as he guides your head down onto his swollen crotch." tags="" position="14987,17380" size="100,100">“Lick the tip, yeah...like that.  Swirl your tongue...oh yeah…” Damien instructs you. ”Holy fuck you are good at this!” he compliments you once you begin to give in.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lhead.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your hair keeps getting in the way, but Damien grabs it in a bunch at the back of your head and takes command, slamming your face against his crotch until your nose pressed into his pubes. You inhale sweaty musk until you’re dizzy but still you keep sucking.

Damien’s breath becomes ragged as he nears his limit.  “Oh my god, yes!” he gasps as his cock trembles and begins to fill your mouth with his cum.  He convulses between your lips until you struggle to contain the volume.  The taste is indescribable, salty, bitter, fishy, sweet and acrid all at the same time.  It definitely doesn’t taste good but it is not altogether unpleasant.  When you look up at Damien you can’t help but feel a little bit proud at the expression of absolute pleasure that marks his face.

“You&#39;ve had quite a few big mouthfuls lately.  It isn’t a big deal, right?  Cheap and fun way to pay your rent if you ask me,” Damien says as he thrusts his stiffening manhood back into your waiting mouth.

//Splloooooosh!//

After taking another load, you stare at your heaving, cum covered breasts.  The distance of Damien’s ejaculation shocks you.  //If he would have done that inside me...//

“Wait…” your line of thought spurs another idea.  “Can I even get pr-pregnant?” you wonder aloud.

Even saying the word //pregnant// makes you queasy.  You are a man.  Men aren’t supposed to get pregnant.  //I shouldn’t have to deal with this shit!//

[[Yet such protestations can not change your circumstances.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2649" name="Yet such protestations can not change your circumstances." tags="" position="14987,17530" size="100,100">A few days later, you are riding Damien’s cock like a mad woman, in an effort to complete your daily regimen of pleasure.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/damiendaily.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“This has got to be heaven… I am fucking the cutest little pussy ever... This view is just... Hnnngg! Your backside is wicked... Ohhh fuck!  Look how tightly you are gripping my cock! Holy shit, Taylor! You&#39;re the best lay I&#39;ve ever had!” Damien praises you as you glide up and down his shaft in a lust driven trance.

After a thorough fucking and a hot shower, Damien leads you to the kitchen table.

He rummages in a cupboard and then produces [[another thick glass bottle filled with a sparkling violet fluid.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2650" name="another thick glass bottle filled with a sparkling violet fluid." tags="" position="14987,17680" size="100,100">Your heart sinks. //Oh no...//

“Is that what I think it is?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/truthserum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I doubt it.  This is //truth serum.//”

“Huh?”  //That is definitely far less perverted than I was expecting but I am sure Damien will find a way to make it so.//

“This one is perfectly safe,” Damien asserts. He pours you each a shot glass of it. “To truth,” he says as he raises his glass in the air.

Clearly Damien wouldn’t consume something if it was dangerous. You raise your own glass and put it to your lips. Apparently you&#39;ve become a bit trusting as df late.

“Bahh…” You grimace at the strongly alcoholic taste.

“Just relax,” Damien advises. “It should kick in soon!”

Damien’s words reverberate in your mind. “My head hurts… I feel kind of //fuzzy.//”

“That’s normal.”

“I don’t feel right…”

“It’s fine, just roll with it. Ahem!” Damien clears his throat before speaking. “Have you ever walked in on your sister naked?” Damien suddenly asks you.

“Huh!?” The strange question catches you completely off guard. “I don’t know… maybe like when we were younger. There is a thing called locks and I am not a huge perv-o like you.”

[[“How many times have you heard Julie having sex or masturbating?”]] Damien continues his ero quiz.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2651" name="“How many times have you heard Julie having sex or masturbating?”" tags="" position="14987,17830" size="100,100">“Ew… That happens a lot.”

“How many times?”

“A lot…. Um… //very frequently?// I don’t know what kind of answer you want from me. I try not to think about it.”

“Hmm… you seem to be telling the truth.”

“Why would I lie?”

“Embarrassment or maybe you want to mess with me?”

“You’re the one that’s messed up.” You try to change the subject. “Fuck, is it hot in here?”

“No that’s just you. Next question! So, uh, what do you think about being a girl?” Damien asks you in a roundabout manner.

“Huh? It fucking sucks! Like literally. I feel like I am trapped with a walking boner AKA //you//!”

“Interesting. What did you think about having sex in that body?”

“Uhh… I…”

“Did it feel good?”

“It hurt and felt weird,” you answer.

“And?”

“And what?”

“And what else did you feel? Was it all bad?”

You feel your face flush with embarrassment as you catch on to Damien’s game. Your thoughts feel slippery and hard to focus on.

“What do you think about me?”

“You make me emotional…” you admit with a happy nod.

“Is one of those emotions love?”

“Mmm…? Mhmm!”

“Yes!”

“I hate you too,” you add with a giggle.

Damien picks your brain clean of any useful sexual tidbit. It feels like the erotic inquisition lasts for hours. You find the experience to be revelatory. After your drug fueled conversation about honesty, your relationship with Damien deepens. For a few random moments you almost feel like genuine friends… Or at least that would be the case if not for your roles [[and the constant need to placate the urges of two young insatiable bodies.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2652" name="and the constant need to placate the urges of two young insatiable bodies." tags="" position="14987,17980" size="100,100">One day fades into another and you settle into a routine of rutting. You hide from the outside world, content to occupy yourself with more pleasant distractions.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/mindflash.webm&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

These distractions only serve to accelerate the passage of time.

You wait at home while Damien works at the hospital. When he returns, you run to the door to greet him like an excited puppy.

The days turn to weeks and then months...

“Merry Christmas, Damien!” 

“Merry Christmas, Taylor,” Damien huffs after covering your chest with his seed.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lxmaspresent.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“I love you so much, little Taylor.”

You bite the inside of your cheek and look away.

One day during the next spring, [[Damien arrives with a gift for you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2653" name="Damien arrives with a gift for you." tags="" position="14987,18130" size="100,100">The arrogant Doctor shows surprising humbleness. Based on his body language you almost expect him to bow before you. “Taylor… You’ve paid your debt to me and then some to the point that I probably owe you one in return. You’ve made my once drab life into one of happiness and pleasure. Thank you! I got you something very special to show my appreciation. I know it has been an uncomfortable journey but you’re a champ.”

With a flourish Damien produces a water bottle filled with the most brightly colored liquid you’ve ever seen outside a lava lamp.

“This will cure you, Taylor,” Damien explains before you can speculate on the potion’s effects. “You’re free to do as you wish.”

You gulp. “You mean I can have my old life back?” //Er… what’s left of it. I’ve probably been declared dead by now...//

“If you want it, yes. Whatever you want.”

For once you read no trace of deception in your friend’s tone. Damien looks down at you impassively. He seems happy but perhaps the tightness around his eyes indicates that he is also a bit worried.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/universepotion.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your eyes are drawn deep into the bottle. “This stuff is … //mesmerizing.//”  //It’s like a whole universe in there!//

Damien nods solemnly.

“What’s it made of?”

“It has about two hundred ingredients, none of them cheap. It’s the pinnacle of science. The product of my research is an essence of radion which enriched but with its radioactive qualities leached out. It’s perfectly safe. [[It is very expensive and to be certain I did some minor controlled tests.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2654" name="It is very expensive and to be certain I did some minor controlled tests.”" tags="" position="14987,18280" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $bobprisoner is true&gt;&gt;You are about to enquire in more detail how Damien tested his glowing elixir but you recall you haven’t seen Bob Terrance since the first night you came back. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; //Even with human testing I doubt this crap is safe...// Still, it may very well be worth the risk. You had almost given up hope of finding a cure.

//The means to turn back into a man is right in front of me so why am I so hesitant? This shouldn’t be a difficult choice!// Yet it is. A supremely difficult choice.

You bite your lip while you consider your options. //Damien isn’t even asking for anything… Oh, man, what the hell am I going to do?! Can I even return to my old life? It’s like Taylor disappeared a year ago!//

Two parallel and very different life paths stretch out before you in your imagination. //Everyone is probably worried about me but...// Your thoughts turn to Damien.

A montage of your recent sexual exploits tumbles through your head.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/lmemories.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Can you really toss away all the pleasures afforded by your new circumstances? What about Damien? Are you capable of leaving him behind?

You consider that returning to your old body after experiencing so much sex as a female may inflict an uncomfortable level of dissonance. //And the transformation process will probably really hurt...//

“Damnit! This was supposed to be an easy choice!”

//I’ve just gotten used to this body… And my life, such as it is...//

“Taylor? What do you want to do? It will rapidly start to lose its potency unless you drink it soon.”

“Guuhh…”
[[Thank you! Pour me a glass!”]]x

Current end of content. Will Taylor be killed, cured, or transformed? Tune out on an upcoming episode of Transfigure to find out!
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2656" name="“No… I don’t think that I can drink it…”" tags="" position="15062,18430" size="100,100">Tears of frustration well in your eyes. You just can’t //quite// take the plunge into another uncertain abyss… at least not alone. You dive forth and cling to Damien’s arm. Relief floods through every fiber of your being as the stressful situation passes.

//God fucking damnit! Rest in peace, manhood. I guess I have gotten way too damned used to this cute little body.//

“I’m sorry Damien but I can’t drink it.” The decision is a tacit admission that lays bare your true nature. Uttering the words feel like they drain and simultaneously uplift part of your soul. Your heart soars and falls, beating faster and faster until you fear a cardiac implosion in your chest.

//Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump-thump-thump...//

Some of your experiences have been awful but they ultimately brought you to this life that you never knew you wanted. You regret nothing. Your time with Damien has transfigured your soul.

Damien stares at you in silence before breaking out in an ear-splitting grin. “I didn’t think I could get any happier and yet here I am. I love you little Taylor!”

//Oh...// You sigh before mumbling, “I love you too, daddy.”

Your life with Damien resumes but with a faster tempo.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/heydamien.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You greet your daddy with a ready smile. “Heeey Damien! I need your help with some non alchemy related activities.”

“What kind of activities?”

“//Bedroom activities.//”

[[“Be-right-there!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2657" name="“Be-right-there!”" tags="" position="15062,18580" size="100,100">You wait patiently for daddy to come before making him cum.

Only your savior can make you feel safe and satisfied.

You may merely be Damien’s beloved sex puppet but you find that lifestyle to be more enjoyable than it sounds.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lwrecked.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Ohhhh fuck!  I love the way your dick feels inside me!” you shout as Damien fills you with your bi-daily load.  Your life may be full of simple pleasures but you are a simple person.  As long as Damien gets you off and lets you stay up late.

“More! More! //Mooooore!//”

You become girlier and more soft spoken with every passing day.

Your chance to change back to your old body may have slipped by but you concede that the additional lifespan and multiple daily orgasms may make up for some of the drawbacks.

You become a fervent worshipper of Damien’s penis. 

“Shit yeah… I love my life!” you say as your tongue swirls around Damien’s glans. You savor the flavor. Damien’s staff provides nearly everything that you want and need in a day.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/littlecockworshipper.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Me too…” Damien agrees.

“Mmmm… Mmm! Mmph! I love it… C’mon daddy! Cum in your little baby’s mouth!”

“HnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggGGGghhhhhhhhaa!!!”

Taylor Roux is tucked away and in his place emerges //Damien’s little girl.// Damien’s little girl has a lot of fun. You have sex nearly constantly, content to revel in the pleasure’s afforded by your nubile body.

Your only note of sadness regards your old life and the people you left behind. Eventually those memories fade away as well, replaced with the bliss of your new life in daddy’s loving care.

“Despite how small I am, don’t underestimate my fierceness! If you are lying I’m definitely going to kick your ass,” you warn Trustworthy.

“I could never let such a cute little girl down,” the doc promises.

You leave the building grinding your teeth. //Well, that could have been worse!//

“Alright! Let’s get on with this stupid ass quest.”

Damien appears confused. “You want me to go with you?” He raises an eyebrow.

“Of course. I’m fucking //tiny//! I need you. What if I have to lift something or fight off a rabid badger or some shit?”

“Uhhh… Okay. I’ll help you. But you need to help me first. I’ve been so //pent up// all day. Being around you this long is cutting off circulation to my dick I’ve been hard so long. These tight pants are stylish but fuck - they really do a number on the junk.”

You sigh. There aren’t many chips for you to bargain with aside from the involving degrading acts with your new body.

//But what other choice do I have? I have to get back on track!//

“Take your shirt off,” Damien commands once you are back to home base.

It appears the train tracks to your destiny lead right through a fetid swamp named Damien.

“No way!”

“What’s the big deal? We’re both guys, right?”

“Exactly!”

“Exactly,” Damien agrees.

//At least if I do this then at least there is a decent chance I can get my old body back.// Failing that, you figure even returning to your female alter ego would be preferable to the insufferably weak body you now possess.

“Alright. How about… I let you look at me but you can’t touch me, got it? I’ll just close my eyes and you can… you can do your business.”

[[“If that helps, why don’t you just do it as I fuck you?”]]

“I disagree. You’re //perfect.// Besides, a vagina is a pretty amazing sex organ. It’s surprisingly durable. More importantly, how can you knock an experience without trying it out first?”

Damien’s cavalier attitude pisses you off. “You already raped me! I’ll remember that disgusting shit the rest of my life.”

“Good. Me too.”

“Kch!”

“Taylor, I’m not waiting anymore!” Damien changes the subject. “Either you take off your shirt or I’m taking mine off.”

In order to free yourself from the prison of a little girl’s body, there are sacrifices to be made.

“I love your cute little titties!” Damien mumbles happily after you take off your shirt.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/littletopless.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien’s dark, lecherous eyes devour your body. [[He has his dick out a second later.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2660" name="He has his dick out a second later." tags="" position="14357,8824" size="100,100">Damien straddles your chest and his musky weiner is pointed directly at you. Damien’s hands aren’t idle for long. 

//Fap fap fap fap fap...//

“Ahh! C’mon! At least stick your tongue out! You aren’t even touching me!”

Damien looks like a beast. //Was I like that once…?// You wonder while Damien strokes himself while staring down into your eyes,
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/lcumshotalt.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Stick out your tongue!” Damien orders.

The moment you obey, Damien hoses you with a fat load of cum.

He groans loudly while wanking off on your face.

//Fap-fap-wap-thwap-thp-thp-thp!// “Uhh! UHHH! AHHHHH!”

Sperm goes flying everywhere. A big glob lands in the center of your tongue. //So much for not touching anything gross...// Now you get to taste something gross too.

“Mnnn…” //At least that’s done now… Soon I’ll be back the way I was...//

[[Trade completed, you clean up and head to the site.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2661" name="Trade completed, you clean up and head to the site." tags="" position="14357,8974" size="100,100">You park as close to the plant as possible. Judging by the distant smoke stacks, you realize you will still be in for quite a hike. After a silent prayer, it’s off into the woods...

Side by side you must look like an odd pair. //Hopefully no one sees us.// The idea sticks in your head until you can’t help but wonder what any passers by might think if they do.

//Brother and sister maybe? Or…// You swallow nervously. //Boyfriend and girlfriend...//

Luckily, the only other presence this far out in the middle of nowhere is that of various forest critters and birds.

Although it pains you to admit, Damien’s presence is comforting. It would be pretty scary and risky to go off exploring alone the way you are now. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/overgrowntrail.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The trail is even rougher… and far longer than expected. It isn’t long before your calf muscles are burning.

//Damn these little legs!// [[It seems like for every normal stride you used to make you now make two.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2662" name="It seems like for every normal stride you used to make you now make two." tags="" position="14357,9124" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Damien&quot; &quot;Damien desc&quot;&gt;&gt;, with his tall, lean body, shows no discomfort. He catches you peeking at him at flashes you a cocky grin.

With what sounds like a distant howl, you find that you are drawn defensively to Damien.

Two abreast, you wind your way through harsh old overgrown trails until you finally emerge from the forest and enter the abandoned industrial site.  Lines of rusting corrugated metal buildings, now almost skeletal remains, forms the base of a large complex.  In the center are smokestacks denoting a factory. On the eastern side, there is abandoned mining equipment and part of a mill and feeder apparatus.  
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/indsite.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Damien takes a stop watch from his pack. “We don’t have much time left. Let’s hurry before it gets too late.”

“This place looks pretty spooky… I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”






Sorry, but I’ve got to stop somewhere :D. Current EoC.

Uh oh! Tango’s out of sugar water! What awaits YP Taylor inside this potentially dangerous area?
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2663" name="You listen to your father’s pitch while displaying as much disinterest as possible." tags="" position="3400,17127.666666666668" size="100,100">“What do //you// want?” you interrupt.

“I was getting to that… Why the hostility? I thought we had a great time. How about we go have another one?” Teddy offers.

“No! You already defiled me!”

“//Defiled?//” Teddy repeats, clearly wounded by your words. “I thought I was being a gentleman and funding the education of a starving student.”

“That’s one way to look at it…”

“Your first time is over. You can’t say you didn’t have any fun. The second time is even better… and then the third? Ohh la la… Why not spend a little more time with me?”

You look around the room. You spot a giggling &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Rhea&quot; &quot;Rhea desc&quot;&gt;&gt; in the arms of an old man. Not wanting to look at that either, you keep your head turning until your eyes land on your boss, the Proprietor. The spectacled man is like an obelisk projecting dutiful work ethic. //Except this is a brothel… with dirty, dirty work… And dirty men,// you add with a sidelong glance at your perverted sire. 

No one has come near you in ages.

//Damnit, Teddy is scaring off all my customers… I need to raise that pile of money ASAP. If old Teddy keeps hounding me all my time will be spent deflecting his advances.// You know once your father sets his sights on something he tends to get it even if it takes a lot of effort. //He clearly likes a challenge… I just wish he’d go find one elsewhere!//

After refusing him half a hundred times, [[Teddy goes over your head and arranges a private session sanctioned by your boss.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2664" name="Teddy goes over your head and arranges a private session sanctioned by your boss." tags="" position="3290,17202.666666666668" size="100,100">“Son of a bitch! Grr…” You shake your head for inadvertently insulting your grandmother. You resolve to give Teddy the most limited service possible.

You cut to the chase. You slide your underwear down while pulling up your dress. To complete your erotic show, you spread your dripping pussy lips.

“No touching. If you want to use this pussy then you have to pay up bigtime.”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/spreadingpetals.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Teddy gulps. “How much?”

“Five thousand.”

“Five thousand!?”

“That’s right. My pussy is pricey. Take it or leave it.”

//There is no way he will waste even more money...//

Teddy begins to take off his coat.

“W-what are you doing?”

Teddy laughs. “I’m getting naked! I already gave your boss another ten grand.”

“You //what!?//” //Where the hell is he getting all this money from!?// Either your father is a closet super saver or an even bigger pervert than you thought. You are pretty sure one suspicion is far more likely to be true than the other.

“Let’s get it on, baby!”

[[“Nooo!” you shriek while scrambling to put your clothes back on.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2665" name="“Nooo!” you shriek while scrambling to put your clothes back on." tags="" position="3421.6666666666665,17237.666666666668" size="100,100">Although you know it is likely foolhardy, you still attempt to bargain. “I’ll do anything except sex.”

Teddy frowns. “The negotiations are already over, sweety. I specifically paid for sex. Enough for two rounds by your own pricing.”

//Crud.//

“Please -- Can’t I do something else? Plllleeease?” you beg while batting your eyelashes.

“Like what?”

“How about umm…” //C’mon, brain, THINK!// “...I dance for you?” you suggest before facepalming. //I suck at dancing...//

Teddy’s good humor returns. He shrugs. “I am not stopping you.”

With your heart in your throat, you hope that action will cure your paralyzed dismay.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance1.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

//Why bother hiding my embarrassment? He is getting off on it!//

“This isn’t enough.”

[[&quot;I&#39;ll dance with my clothes off!&quot;]] you compromise.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2666" name="&quot;I&#39;ll dance with my clothes off!&quot;" tags="" position="3300,17317.666666666668" size="100,100">Teddy shakes his head thoughtfully side to side.

//Of course he wants more, the damn lecher.  I might have to go right to my limits and beyond in order to get through this.// You figure if you get passed this night without having sex with Teddy again then you will have dodged a bullet.

You feel a bit like an improv artist. You twist the dial on the clock radio and find an okay song to dance too, at least relative to the abundance of country music. 

You begin to move in time with music, expanding your dance show. Your dance moves become more suggestive with each beat of the song.

With rocking hips, you pull up your shirt and expose your midriff. 

Teddy watches you, his eyes like fireflies lit up in the night.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance2.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Urged on by Teddy’s enamoured stare, you give in to your own perverted impulses and begin to dance more provocatively.

You run your fingers down your lean, flat stomach and then over your exposed panties.

//Sqlick!//

You remove your hands from your abnormally warm pubic region.

//I am definitely not getting turned on by this! … Am I?// While you wonder about the trigger behind your own arousal, it is hard to deny the evidence of Teddy’s epitomized by his formidable bulge.

//Ziiiip!//

Cock in hand, &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; [[Roux looks at you with unbridled lust while enjoying your show.]]

The thought turns your stomach.

“I’d appreciate it if you could at least act happy for me. Seeing you smile makes me happy.”

“Kch… I guess that’s not a big deal.”

You open up the front of your top and let your boobs bounce free, much to Teddy’s delight.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance3.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You had never expected to strip for anyone, let alone your own dad.

“Oh baby, you are amazing.”

“Can you please not call me baby?”

“Why?”

//Because I’m literally your fucking baby?!// “Because it makes me uncomfortable,” you answer.

“Good. Uncomfortable is good. You make me //so uncomfortable too//,” Teddy agrees while stroking himself.

“That’s not what I meant…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance4.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

The string of your underwear flosses the space between your firm ass cheeks. [[You slowly work your g-string down to the floor.]]

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance5.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You feel sexy and foolish at the same time. //Damnit, Teddy...//

You let him enjoy your stunning side profile and some prime hip shaking. For a second you almost find yourself having fun before you are reminded by the eternal weirdness of the situation.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance6.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your father’s eyes are glued to your booty.

[[“I want to see you up close!”]] Teddy requests.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2669" name="“I want to see you up close!”" tags="" position="3445,17466" size="100,100">You dance towards him, shaking your money maker all the while. You tense up as you get closer. You can feel your father’s hot breath on your buns.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance7.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Ooohh… I am going to fuck you into the next world, baby,” Teddy growls as he admires your backside.

You shake your head frantically. //No, no! Just keep dancing...// Your hope that Teddy exhausts himself during your show dies with the end of the song.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/dance8.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

You realize that you are both naked… and aroused. Teddy shoots you a look that makes you freeze. //There is no way I am getting out of here until he cums...//

Since Teddy has tired of your show, you may have to sacrifice yourself yet again.

//Waaaaaaah! I don’t want to do this again!// Without the help of the “anxiety pills” this moment is horrifying.

//Maybe if I don’t have to look at him during the act I can get through this… // 

You think of a few positions facing away. //Doggy… sixty nine… Ew...// Nothing sounds appealing. It kills you a bit inside that you have to make such a concession.

[[Encourage Teddy to sixty nine.]]

//Is this what I used to look like…? Shit, I can’t not think about this stuff! Ahh...// “Hmm? Oh.” Your tornado of messed up thoughts disappears in an instant.

“Hmmmnnnnaaaaaaaaahhhh!” you cry out as Mr. Roux’s hot tongue sinks deep into your vagina. Every muscle in your body tenses, especially around your legs and glutes. Your resolve goes from stoic to mush as quickly as you can blink. You’ve never felt more awake.

Teddy grabs your ass cheeks and forces you onto his mouth. He then unknowingly feasts on his genderbent son’s pussy.

Your father’s tongue work is immaculate. You go from uncomfortable to overwhelmingly turned on in the span of a handful of carefully placed licks and soft presses with his fingers. Your legs turn to jelly. An orgasm is already on the horizon this early into the interaction. //This is sooo fuckin baaad! Ahhhhhhhhhh!//

“Mmmhmmm! Ahhhh! Ho-ho-holly shit....” You are holding on by a thread.

Your dad clearly knows his way around a pussy. You always knew your dad was charming and that he had a lot of romantic experience, as his bragging and lame stories meant to impress and advise you growing up were to attest.

//But I’m a girl now… and he wants to teach me naughty things!  I wonder if he would have given me different advice if I had grown up like this?// His advice would probably be: “daughter, don’t fall prey to guys like me.”

//This is really fucking bad!// The only thing worse is that you still have a role to play.

Urged on by Teddy’s tongue play, you focus on the stiff dick in front of you. Starting with a soft kiss, you inhale your father’s musk. Teddy is already drooling precum all over you.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/teddy69.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
//Damnit...//

//Mmm… Chu… Sliiip… Mnn… Omm...  Umm....//

You climb on top and start to suck on Teddy with an eagerness that surprises you both.

Lewd sucking sounds fill the air. “Omm… Mmffa… Omm… Mmm…”

//Slck slick schhlick…//

“MM!” you are startled when your father peels back the hood of your clitoris with the apex of his tongue. With the soft, slick flesh of his tongue he probes your most sensitive bits with just the right amount of force. The experienced man has your body figured out better than you do. You can’t see his face but you’re certain the doofus is grinning.

“Fwaaahhh!”

Your mouth is filled with salty precum… and the taste makes you desire even more of it.

[[Rolling your tongue over Teddy’s weeping glans, you are forced to ingest your father’s forbidden flavor.]]

Face down, ass up, you entice your father to join you on the dais. Teddy wastes no time considering your offer. You are penetrated and filled up with your father’s big hot cock. You feel every inch of his flesh inside your own.

“Hnnn!” //It’s happening again! I’m having sex with my dad...//

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddydoggypen.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

It only takes a moment before you are filled with Roux cock. Big hands grab your butt and assist in finding the right timing.

//At least I don’t have to see his face… I’ll just pretend it’s someone else!// But even doing that doesn’t change the fact that the sensations you are experiencing are caused by a //penis.// One that belongs to a very close family member.

“Ahhh yes! Ff… Yeah, yes, mmm, baby!” Teddy mumbles as he fucks you.

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddydoggy.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

Your father unleashes an impressive display of stamina for his age, ramming his penis in and out of you thousands of times.

After what feels like thousands of years, your father swells inside you and begins to move faster and faster, heralding the onslaught of cum to come. 

After a succession of rapid thrusts, Teddy goes balls deep before you feel the spray of warm liquid. You look down at your oozing creampie and feel like a colossal slut.

//[[Fuck me… I had sex with dad again…]]//

Your shut eyes do nothing to shield you from the feeling of penetration. In one long, clean thrust, your father’s spear thrusts all the way to the base of your womb.

“Hnnnghh! FUUCK!”

“I know… I was gentle with you the first time but now I will treat you like a real woman.”

//Treat me like a real woman...// The embarrassing thought ripples through your mind as Teddy repeatedly lances into the absolute limits of your new female body.

Your shaking legs become a distraction. You grip your own heels and are shocked to find that the act repositions you just enough that Teddy’s cock works the most delightfully sensitive spot with every feverish pass.

He bottoms out with every thrust. You are pelted with balls and stuffed with hot, pulsing cock.

Teddy’s actions become more frantic until he finally gives you a dozen hard, full strikes before going balls deep and ejactulating deep inside you.

You feel your father’s semen splash through your vaginal canal. You really hope you haven’t created the start of a incestuous lovechild.

“Haah, haah… Worth every penny,” your dad pants as he sitrs up your cumpot with a few half hearted thrusts from his softening cock.

“Ahhh FUCK! Why am I even considering this!” Wads of cash flash through your mind, followed by an echo of Rhea’s teasing. “But if I keep doing this how will I even look at myself in the mirror?”

You know that if you go to the hotel there will be serious repercussions. //How will I live by myself? What if I do this and he finds out one day?//

The next day at work when Teddy inevitably comes to claim his second round, you don’t bother fighting. With a heavy heart you trudge up to a private room to follow his advance instructions.

“Mmhmm…” //What a guy… always trying to be charming even when he’s not...//

“Oh hell yes! Suck my cock, baby! Oooooooh!”

You oblige him until you gag. With no warning except a flood of precum and a muffled grunt, Teddy blows directly into your mouth.

“Mmmmggfaah!!” With a mouthful of your father’s sperm, you barely resist the urge to gag. 
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/teddyunloads.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Blegh… Eww...”

After Teddy is done wanking, you spit out his cum in a tissue and then move to leave before he stops you.

“Hooaahh… That was a great warm up, Taylor. But I need to feel your vagina wrapped around my dick otherwise I will never be satisfied. This is a brothel right? A house of satisfaction?”

//Awww, not again...//

You die a bit inside with each lewd act performed but you are so hot and bothered that it is currently impossible to stop.

You flop back on the bed. “Do what you need to do. Just hurry the fuck up, alright?”
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/teddypenetrates.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Haste makes waste,” Teddy replies as he eases his manhood down the center of your labia.

Since you are already wet with saliva (you hope it is mostly saliva), your pussy easily gives way to the first serious push.

“Hrrrck!! Hnnngghghh! F-fuuck!” 

//There it is again… the feeling of a cock. A man’s cock. My dad’s cock! Fuuuuuuuuuuck!//

With every pass of Teddy’s penis, you feel yourself fall deeper into a mental void.

You awkwardly fuck until more primal emotions take hold. Eventually Teddy gets his money’s worth and stuffs his shaft balls deep inside you. Of course he ejaculates inside your pussy.

//[[Fuck me… I had sex with dad again…]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2675" name="I must have the worst luck and judgement ever or something" tags="" position="3595,17914.333333333332" size="100,100">When &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Teddy&quot; &quot;Teddy desc&quot;&gt;&gt; finally arrives, he uncharacteristically wastes little time stoking his own ego. Instead, he focuses on reigniting your passions from the previous night.

Your cursed body falls victim to Teddy’s experience and technique. With firm, practiced fingers he traces the outline of our collar bone with just enough pressure to relieve a lot of tension in your upper pectoral muscles that you didn’t even know you had.

“Ooooh…”

//I didn’t realize my chest was this sore. It’s these damn boobs… Oh man, they feel all tingly… my nipples are hard too!// 

Teddy reads you like a book. Picking up on your cues of arousal, he begins to massage your chest while stripping off your clothing.

“Huuuaahh~!”

“Heh, having fun my little beauty?” 

You nod shyly, turning your head to the side when Teddy moves in. His kiss lands on your cheek.

“I love your little contradictions,” Teddy whispers to you.

“What do you mean?”

Teddy gently brushes a strand of your long brown hair from the corner of your vision. “You’re enthralling. You’re spunky. Cute but prickly with a core of warmth. I can tell you have a big heart. You’re like a yin yang of ice and fire.”

“W-What?” You are rendered momentarily speechless. The deep compliment catches you off guard.

//Fuck, dad always had a way with words and his timing is usually impeccable...//

You shake your head, hoping to dispel some of the weird, creeping thoughts that hover around the periphery of your mind.

You attempt a pre-emptive strike. “Let’s stop wasting time. You want to do it, right?”

To your dismay, Teddy shakes his head. [[“Would you mind blowing me a bit first? I’m not as young as I used to be.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2676" name="“Would you mind blowing me a bit first? I’m not as young as I used to be.”" tags="" position="3595,18066" size="100,100">//For fuck’s sake...//

You lie down between your father’s legs. His impressive Roux rod stands at full attention.

//The more effort I put into this, the quicker it will be over,// you tell yourself.

You give Little Teddy a sloppy kiss and then proceed to massage him with a loose grip.

You try your best to get your partner off. As you tongue Teddy’s weeping cockhead while pumping his shaft, you are greeted with a near constant trickle of sweet precum.

It builds up at the back of your throat but still you continue your efforts.  

“Mmmm… Ommm… Mmmm… Op... Ommm…”

 &lt;video src=&quot;Images/teddysuckoff.mp4&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;vcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; 

“Hey Taylor.” You look up at Teddy as he calls your name.

When your eyes lock, Teddy’s cock twitches in your mouth and you are rewarded with another significant dose of precum. 

You look away in shame but find nowhere better to direct your vision. It is far too visceral of an experience to look at your father directly while performing such a shameful act on him.

[[“That’s enough! I am ready! Hop on!”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2677" name="“That’s enough! I am ready! Hop on!”" tags="" position="3595,18216" size="100,100">You “hop on,” sitting down reverse cowgirl style on your Teddy’s lap. With a shaking hand, you guide your father’s penis into your forbidden honey pot.

//Sqllliiiick!// 

It is a tight fit but Teddy manages to impale you on his staff.

//Here I go again.. Fucking my own dad!// “Hnnnnmmm! Ahhhh! Hnnnngfffffuuuckk…!”

The act is so right and wrong all at the same time. Your mind screams that you are sick for allowing this to happen but your feminine body, driven by biological cravings beyond your control, is urged to rock her hips and bob on the big cock inside her, regardless of who owns it.

Your window to flee or jump out a window passes by…

//Fwap-fap-swap-clip-schlllick! Fap-fap-fap-fap-fap-fap!//

After a time, your intercourse becomes less awkward and more fluid.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/pussypoundedstockings.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your dad settles into a steady rhythm, fucking you with gusto.

Your nervousness causes you to squeeze him even more tightly, a fact Teddy seems to appreciate. Your vagina along with your inexperienced body cannot respond fast enough to the stimuli you are experiencing.

Your brain goes haywire as you cum on your father’s surging cock. “Hnnnn! Ahhhhhh! Fuck! Fwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!”

//Damnit… the only thing worse than having sex with your father is having sex with your father and enjoying it.//

Your hips and pelvis shudder as your body tenses up.

“Unnnngh!” “//What the hell just happened?//” you wonder. Wide eyed, you look at your Dad.

“G- spot located,” Teddy replies. The smugness in his voice is so thick it is like a slap in the face.

Within seconds you are trembling. From toe to tip, you are set afire in a pleasurable blaze. [[Teddy hits your sweet spot and stokes the fire raging within you into an inferno hot enough to melt steel.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2678" name="Teddy hits your sweet spot and stokes the fire raging within you into an inferno hot enough to melt steel." tags="" position="3595,18366" size="100,100">“Oh, no. OH, NO! I feel like I am going to… Ooooohhhhh!” Your legs convulse and shake as you squirm, body on autopilot. You feel your vagina flood with love juice to the point you fear that you may lose control of your bladder.

“Mmmmmmnnnnnaaahhh!” you moan as your orgasm lingers. Teddy allows you no respite. Held in strong, familiar arms,  you are stoked back up to your previous high point and beyond. Then you cum over and over again. Sex as a woman - sex with Teddy just feels too damned good!

It’s almost as if you unlock one of the secrets of the universe. Your orgasms cycle into each other, letting you float in a cloud of natural bio-chemical soup. Urged on by Teddy’s pistoning cock, you go over the edge again and again.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I am going to cum!” //Again! Fuuuuuck!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/teddytoofar.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Your both cum hard. As your orgasm’s effects linger, you stare at the fading spots dancing in your vision.

Your dad was right. The third time was the charm. //What if the fourth time is even better? Oh shit, what’s going to happen to me?//





Current end of content :(

Awww. Sadly that’s all folks. Will Taylor and Teddy have a future together or is their relationship merely about transactonal sex?

A super special thanks to Director G for sponsoring this route addition!!

&lt;3 Tango
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2679" name="are in a rush to get their suitcases loaded and arrive early enough for their flight." tags="" position="5013,22814" size="100,100">Sandra gives you a quick once over with basics like contact and emergency information. “You can sleep over in the spare room here,” she adds.

Sandra shows off a fully stocked fridge before resuming last minute preparations for her trip.

“I guess we are all set.”

“I’m sure you will do your best. Don’t forget to crack the books! I think you are the missing piece of the puzzle to get Craig’s inner genius to shine.”

//Inner genius…?//

“Have fun on your trip.” You say your goodbyes.

“Thank you so much!” Sandra shouts to you from the car as the pair departs.

//Wow… Two weeks alone with Craig...// “That is a long time to be around someone as weird as Craig… At least the house is comfy. I doubt I’ll be bored.”

That prediction is confirmed almost immediately. You go to check on Craig and find him in his room at his computer. [[Everything is normal except for that fact Craig isn’t wearing anything below the waist.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2680" name="Everything is normal except for that fact Craig isn’t wearing anything below the waist." tags="" position="5013,22964" size="100,100">He isn’t even masturbating like a normal pervert. Craig is waiting dumbly for you to come and catch him.

//Two weeks of this…? Fuck me, what I gotten myself into?!// “What the hell, Craig?! You promised to knock off the creepy bullshit. Your parents haven’t even been gone five fucking minutes yet!”

“The pants hurt my waist. This is just more comfortable,” he explains with his usual placid expression. You can’t tell whether he is trolling you or not.

“Uh huh… Still, I’d like you to put on some pants.”

Craig’s eyes light up. “I will if you want to make a bet!” he offers.

“No! No fuckin’ bets!”

&quot;How about I put on clothes and you take off yours?&quot; Craig suggests.

&quot;No!&quot;

Craig shrugs. “Then I am going to stay like this all week.”

“What?”

“You can’t force me to get dressed.”

“I’m not even going to try. You think I’m grossed out by your junk? I am but I’ve been in the locker room before, pal. All you are doing is making yourself look like an idiot. If you don’t want people to make fun of you, you should knock it off.”

Your words wash off Craig like water running off a stone. “Well, get used to this view.”

You fend off a dozen of Craig’s creepy ploys before dinner time. 

[[After threatening him with no dinner, Craig finally deigns to put on a pair of slacks.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2681" name="After threatening him with no dinner, Craig finally deigns to put on a pair of slacks." tags="" position="5013,23114" size="100,100">You heat up and serve one of the meals Sandra prepared.

“I want something else,” Craig says after pushing his food around his plate for ten minutes. 

“What would you prefer?’

“Ohhh! I know what we could have!” Craig jumps up and runs into the kitchen and then out into the garage entry. A few moments later, a panting Craig returns with a six pack of //Michelangelo&#39;s Hard Lemonade.//

“Uh, Craig. I don’t think that is a good idea. For either of us,” you add.

“No! Nooo it is! We are all alone. So-so, w-we can do anything! We’re free. I never get to have these drinks. When I went to buy my own I had no one to share with. B-but now I have you. I want to drink with a friend.”

You shake your head slowly.

“I-I bet you can’t even handle one now that you are a girl,” Craig attempts to goad you. It works far too well. That fact pisses you off so much that you begin to wonder if you may have anger management issues.

//Damnit.// You roll your eyes in frustration. “Okay. But just one, Craig. You’re not going to get me drunk so don’t even try.”

You and Craig each sip on a bottle of Michelangelos while watching cartoons on TV. The experience reminds you of teenage nights growing up. //The kind of nights Craig never got to experience due to his time in the hospital...//

“Hmm…”

//Why do I keep pitying this guy?// In many ways Craig seems to deserve most of the abuse he suffers. //Hmm… or is that maybe backwards?//

Craig grins at you once your bottle is empty. &quot;Hey, Taylor? How about we do one final contest?&quot;

You almost laugh. &quot;For all the marbles?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. All marbles! All of them! Loser does what the winner says.&quot;

//Heh, does he really think a single drink would affect my judgement that much?// “Craig, that isn’t worth it to me. You don’t really have anything that I want,” you patiently explain why he has little power over you.

Craig is keen to argue. “T-that’s not true. W-what about //you?//”

“What do you mean?”

“Y-your identity. I’ll trade it. I will swear to keep your secret for the rest of mm-my life.”

You narrow your eyes at Craig. “No one would believe you anyway.” 

“But it’s true. I will promise not to hold secrets against people. //Ever again.// [[So if you win, you can make me be good for the rest of my life.]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2682" name="So if you win, you can make me be good for the rest of my life." tags="" position="5013,23264" size="100,100">“Hmmph.” You seriously doubt Craig’s long term commitment. //Still, Craig does seem to value the honor involved in a bet. If I win here I might just be home free once this is all over! But still… I am pretty sure I can guess what this big stinker is after.//

Craig begins to explain the rules. “Heads or tails. Winner gets to pick the game.”

You shrug. “Sure. Flip.” //I swear if I lose this shit I am going to Gamblers Anonymous.//

Craig tosses a coin into the air. The silver flash of metal will hold your destiny.

“C-call it.”

“Heads.”

Craig reveals the coin. “It’s tails! I get to pick the game.”

You crack your knuckles as you mentally prepare yourself for a challenge. //Will it be Mega Blazers or Tic-Tac-Toe?//

Of course Craig has a cunning ploy in mind. &quot;This is the b-blowjob game,” he decides. “If you can&#39;t make me cum in fifteen minutes, I win.&quot;

“So you want me suck your dick? That’s not a game!” //Besides - either way he wins...//

Craig shakes his pudgy head. “A g-g-g-ame is a form of competition played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or l-l-luck,” he recites the definition. “This counts.”

“Un-be-fucking-lievable.”

Too much is at stake now to just back down.// Leave it to Craig to pick such a sick game. I am almost certain to win this little gambit… making my tasks much easier.// But that still involves blowing Craig. //What a clever perv… I guess he has finally realized I am not to be trifled with and wants one last hurrah.// 

[[&quot;This is the last bet I am ever making with you, Craig.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2683" name="&quot;This is the last bet I am ever making with you, Craig.&quot;" tags="" position="5013,23414" size="100,100">&quot;Oooh! A life-long bet? T-that&#39;s awesome! I know you will keep your word.&quot;

&quot;Wait, I didn&#39;t agree to that!&quot;

“It’s okay. I have a timer here.” Craig sets down an egg timer.

This has got to be the most humiliating challenge of your life. You are glad for the lack of witnesses. 

You are pushed down in front of Craig&#39;s rigid penis.

You bite your lip as you appraise the timer and Craig’s hard cock. //Fifteen minutes… I definitely can do this but… do I even really want to?//

Craig winds the timer to the appropriate time and sets it down. “A-and goo!” he shouts.

Like the gunshot signaling the start of a race, you are launched into action. You go for a knockout in the first round.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigblow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Mmmmmpphh… Ommm! Mwaah! MMmmm!” //Fuckin&#39; sick! His dick tastes like squid!//

//Sluuuuurp!//

“Ohhhh, Taylor~! You’re so good! And I feel good too!”

“Mmm! Mmm! Ooommmmwaah…”

//Why the fuck is this taking so long!? He was so easy to please before!//

The constant clicking wail of the timer urges you to move faster. //Clickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk...//

//Fap-fap-fap-fap-FAP-FAP-FAP-FAP!// You jerk off the portly manchild as fast as you physically can but still it is not enough to force Craig to climax.

//How is he still not finished?! Any man would have cum by now!//

//Fuck, fuck, fuck!// You become more frantic. You suck deeper, swirl your tongue faster, and delve deeper down Craig’s shaft. You absolutely make love to Craig’s dick and still he doesn’t react properly until it is too late.

//[[Brrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg!!!]]//
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2684" name="Brrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg!!!" tags="" position="5013,23564" size="100,100">The timer goes off and two seconds later, as if his orgasm is controlled by a switch, Craig gives you a stinking, thick facial that you will never forget. You are disgusted beyond words as cum sprays all over you. 

With the stench of cum and failure in the air you feel so nauseous that you fear you will faint then and there. //I’m so screwed...//

//Holy fuck I just lost my freedom AND still took a load of jizz on my face! How the hell did this happen to me again!? Fucking shit!!//
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craigjizz2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
After you wipe the semen from your eyes, you try and add some qualifiers to prevent a cascade of idiocy. “Craig, this is just for two weeks…”

“//Lifelong deal!// Liiiife looong-deal!” Craig repeats those words over and over again. You can tell the tubby little schemer is practically jumping with joy.

You storm off to the bathroom. After a scalding rinse, you head for the guest bedroom, eager to hide from Craig and his requests.

//That fuckin’ twerp will think he owns me like a cow or something now...// Frustrated beyond measure, you find your room.

“As much as it would be nice to abandon Craig, [[I guess I should stay out here for the first night at least…]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2685" name="I guess I should stay out here for the first night at least…" tags="" position="5013,23714" size="100,100">You lie down on the unfamiliar bed. You are often a fussy sleeper, so you are pleased when you realize the bed is soft but firm with a comfortable duvet cover.

You are almost out like a light when you hear the heater kick on.

The vents  begin pouring out hot air. You go from a near optimal sleeping temperature to sweating pig level of discomfort in the span of three or four minutes.

“It is hotter than the fuckin’ sun in here,” you complain. //Hopefully it will turn off in a sec...//

You strip off clothing until you are practically naked.

“Damnit…”

Finally the heater switches off. You go to sleep and have strangely vivid dreams. You dream of having wild, hardcore sex with shadowy figures.

To your horror, you wake up and find that your dreams were all too real. Your panties are found around your ankles. There is crusty semen around your coochie.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/coveredpov.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“W-what?” There is only one source of such emissions in this house…  //Fucking Craig! I can’t believe he’d do something like this while I slept!// You rub your vagina, glad to find that it feels normal. 

Your relief that you avoided penetration quickly transforms back into anger.

“He’s gone nuts!”  //And I am stuck with this lecherous goblin for two weeks! What the hell do I even say or do at this point!? I better treat this delicately otherwise something really bad might happen...//

The next night you are more aware, snapping awake when the mattress springs begin to depress. You tense up and freeze.

Your first instinct is to...

[[Get angry!]]x
[[Pretend to be asleep.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2687" name="Pretend to be asleep." tags="" position="5123,23864" size="100,100">You keep your eyes shut. Out of potential curiosity or fear you cannot quite say.

Your prone body is manipulated by pudgy fingers. Your underwear pulled down and your butt cheeks pried apart. Craig caresses the inside of your thighs before rubbing the outside of your pussy.

His wheezing and heavy breathing bother you nearly as much as the touching.

The groping intensifies. Craig’s fingers become bolder and bolder.

As deranged as Craig may be, you didn’t truly believe he’d actually fuck you… until his penis begins to slide inside you not long after light’s out.
&lt;img src=&quot;Images/craignightfuck.gif&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
“Huahhmmmm…” you whimper into your pillow.

//No fucking way… I’m having sex with Craig!// Or rather, Craig is having sex with //you.//

“Mmmph!”

//Is this rape or fulfilling a deal…?// you wonder. You want to cry out and stop Craig but all you can do is lie there as he stuffs your virginal pussy with cock.

This isn’t the way you imagined sex as a girl would be. The pain is minimal. The sensation of penetration is more muted than you expected. It certainly doesn’t feel good but it doesn’t hurt either.

Craig huffs and wheezes as he nears the end of his experience. “Ohhh, yy-y-y-es Taaay-lor! I loooove you!” he moans the second before your vaginia is splashed with warm wetness. The splatters continue, coating your butt cheeks with Craig’s unwanted sperm.

Craig kisses you on the back of your head before making a hasty and somewhat panicked departure.

//Wow, I just had sex with Craig… and didn’t stop it...// The Bells won’t be back for ages. So you are stuck with Craig for the better part of two weeks. //Will I be able to make it through this without killing Craig or myself?// you idly wonder as you wipe up Craig’s mess.

“Not good…”
